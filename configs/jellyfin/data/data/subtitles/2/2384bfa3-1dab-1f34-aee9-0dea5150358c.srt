1
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:11,887
<i>My name is Rusty Sabich,
and I am the prosecutor in this trial.</i>

2
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,809
Sitting over there is the accused,
James McDavid, and I can tell you

3
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,270
that he sits there not guilty

4
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,398
because that is what
our constitution demands.

5
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:27,361
Now, I will present evidence to show you
that the accused committed this crime.

6
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,613
And should you find that to be likely--

7
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,991
likely-- you got to vote not guilty.

8
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:38,664
Should you find that to be very likely,
you have to set him free.

9
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:43,126
My job is to prove guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt...

10
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:48,131
and being on a jury,
that is a high calling.

11
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:52,135
And being entrusted with the prosecution,
satisfying the burden of proof,

12
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,637
that is also a high calling.

13
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:59,518
I will live up to my duty,
and I ask that you rise up to yours.

14
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,897
Let's do our jobs, shall we?

15
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:13,699
That's way high.

16
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,868
Way high. Come on.

17
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,536
Give me some more.
Just focus. Take a breath.

18
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,246
Hey, just take a breath.

19
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,248
You're rushing it all. Just breathe.

20
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,541
How's it going out there?

21
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,500
Nice.

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,128
I heard something about runners
on second and third.

23
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,005
Not the testicles!

24
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,131
Nasty!

25
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:32,176
Hey, guys,
I thought we said no curveballs.

26
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,261
Let the boy pitch, hon.
Just let the boy pitch.

27
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,387
- Dad.
- Yeah?

28
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,847
It's Raymond.

29
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,809
You threw a couple great ones today.

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,980
There must be some new poll out
or something.

31
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,523
You have got to be kidding me.

32
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,941
Daddy suggested it.

33
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:49,735
Hey.

34
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,496
When?

35
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,626
Yeah. I'll be right there.

36
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,964
Barbara, can I talk to you for a second?

37
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,425
Yeah. Sure.

38
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,813
Yeah?

39
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,609
Carolyn Polhemus was murdered.

40
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,281
When?

41
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,368
I don't know. I have to-- I'm gonna--
I have to go. I'll be back.

42
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,707
You don't wanna go in there. It's bad.

43
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,170
{\an8}All right. Make sure you glove up.

44
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,561
I should take the case,

45
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,481
'cause something of this stature
should be either Rusty or me,

46
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,733
- and Rusty's too close.
- No, I need to be in charge.

47
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,318
And why is that, exactly?

48
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,320
Well, first of all,
because Raymond asked me to be,

49
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,365
and he still is the district attorney,
Nico, however much you want that title.

50
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,534
And second, I'm better than Tommy, so...

51
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:47,079
Okay, look. For the record,
until I win the election--

52
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,499
and I'm going to win-- I will remain
your loyal and trusted servant.

53
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,417
It's Rusty's case, all right?

54
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,546
Tommy, you cannot see straight on things.
Admit it.

55
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,799
Your view is likely obstructed
by Nico's sphincter.

56
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,843
- You dismiss me at your peril.
- Fuck off.

57
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:05,347
I just want the best lawyer for the job,
and it's Rusty.

58
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,185
Eugenia, can you please ask Rigo
to meet me in my office?

59
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,103
Okay, yeah.

60
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,985
Oh, fuck.

61
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,612
I know.

62
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,906
I know.

63
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,994
Oh, Jesus Christ.

64
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,747
Rigo, what do you got?

65
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,542
PD's on forensics,

66
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,752
night of timeline, last known contacts.

67
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,129
Where are we starting?

68
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,089
Recent releases. TCS parolees.

69
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,509
Jesus.

70
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,512
- You think it was revenge?
- I don't know. Who knows?

71
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,555
I don't know.

72
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,433
When the labs come in,

73
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,560
can you just make sure
that they come only to me?

74
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,312
To me only. Not to Molto or Delay.

75
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,942
Yeah, you got it.

76
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,737
<i>One of Raymond Horgan's top lieutenants,</i>

77
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:05,115
<i>a tough prosecutor
with political aspirations of her own,</i>

78
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,702
{\an8}<i>Miss Polhemus was reportedly
bludgeoned to death in her home,</i>

79
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:14,124
<i>her housekeeper discovering her body
shortly after ten o'clock this morning.</i>

80
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,045
{\an8}<i>And it's been a rough day on Wall Street
with prices on the Dow--</i>

81
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,510
<i>Our hearts go out to Carolyn
and her loving family.</i>

82
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,262
{\an8}<i>We're all quite rightly stunned
and rattled</i>

83
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,641
{\an8}<i>by such a grotesque
and heartless act of violence.</i>

84
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:34,228
<i>And to the public at large,
we hear your anguish and your fear</i>

85
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,271
<i>because we feel it too.</i>

86
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,358
<i>It is difficult for the citizenry
to feel safe</i>

87
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,360
{\an8}<i>when we can't even protect
our own prosecutors.</i>

88
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,571
- Wow. Such a dick.
- <i>We have to do better.</i>

89
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,073
<i>We must do better, frankly.</i>

90
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,616
- He's not wasting any time, is he?
- No.

91
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,160
<i>We owe that, not only to Carolyn Polhemus,</i>

92
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,539
<i>but to her friends and family
that will never see her a--</i>

93
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:00,128
You okay?

94
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:02,798
Yeah.

95
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:06,552
Yeah.

96
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,847
Oh, Rusty.

97
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,955
I will try and be here for you...

98
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,546
But I can't do the memorial.

99
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,134
<i>I understand.</i>

100
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,887
Thanks for coming today.

101
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,555
Thanks for--

102
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,641
Thank you.

103
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,351
How are we doing?

104
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,604
Same as you, I guess.

105
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,189
You know anything more?

106
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,149
No, not much, but I got Rigo on it.

107
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,109
You know, the clock is ticking on this,

108
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,320
and my expiration date
is in the crosshairs.

109
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,281
Oh, well, don't worry.
We're gonna find out who did this.

110
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,657
Who's our ME?

111
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,076
Painless.

112
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:17,164
- Kumagai. Jesus fucking Christ.
- Raymond.

113
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,123
Rusty.

114
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,000
- Delay.
- I don't like being called that.

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,543
Just a joke.

116
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,128
This press conference, Nico.

117
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,047
Please, can we not do this right here?

118
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:28,258
Fuck off. Teeing up
Carolyn's murder for political gain.

119
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,302
Hey. Raymond, let's not do this right now.

120
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,054
- Fuck you too, Tommy.
- This is beneath us.

121
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,639
- Just shut the fuck up.
- This is beneath us.

122
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,724
Nothing's beneath me.
I once fucked an ottoman.

123
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,102
The Lord is nigh unto them
that are of broken heart,

124
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,148
who are pressed
and bored down with afflictions,

125
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,819
by the sorrow of heart
under which their spirits are broken

126
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,865
or with a sense of sin and sorrow for it

127
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,244
by which their hearts smite them...

128
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,745
- Her ex.
- ...and they are wounded by it...

129
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,330
- You ever meet him?
- No.

130
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,499
- ...and broken with it.
- Fucking weirdo.

131
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,167
These are just words.

132
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,544
He has an alibi.

133
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,880
- Carolyn Polhemus was flesh and blood...
- Who's the kid next to him?

134
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,550
- ...beloved daughter...
- Her son.

135
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,593
...mother, public servant.

136
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,928
You didn't know?

137
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,183
Words cannot convey the loss

138
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,519
or ease our grief.

139
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,816
We tell ourselves
we keep her in our hearts and our minds.

140
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,735
- Sorry, Raymond, I'm just gonna--
- Yeah.

141
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,404
Ash would not be just ash.

142
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,407
Her dust will not be just dust.

143
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,159
Her memory will fill us.

144
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,584
It just seems strange that she
would never mention that she had a kid.

145
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,169
And the ex has custody?

146
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,254
I'm assuming he does. Yeah.

147
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:53,886
Listen, please tell me
that we have some kind of a lead on this,

148
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:57,264
and that we are not
absolutely out to fucking sea.

149
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,849
I have an idea.

150
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,475
- Okay.
- Bunny Davis.

151
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,770
Reynolds? We convicted that guy.

152
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,814
Yeah, but Carolyn and I
worked that case together.

153
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:09,401
So you're saying
that we put an innocent man behind bars

154
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,904
only to have the real killer
kill one of our prosecutors?

155
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:14,198
Great. That'll get me fucking reelected.

156
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,411
The two of them were tied up
in exactly the same way.

157
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,748
Do you really think there's a connection?

158
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,547
You asked if we were out at sea.

159
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,981
Dad?

160
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,322
How come you're home?

161
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,074
I was at Carolyn's memorial.

162
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,834
You wanna try some?

163
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,839
Come on. Let's see the curveball. Come on.

164
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,470
Show me the curveball.

165
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,316
Again. Let's see it again.

166
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:34,963
<i>Blunt force trauma to the head.
That's the official cause of death.</i>

167
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,840
<i>Read the report. I sent it over.</i>

168
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,552
I did. There's no chemistry, pathology,
toxicology. Wasn't very thorough.

169
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,180
Wow. Go fuck yourself.

170
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,098
I am a medical doctor,

171
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,226
and you will give me your respect
while you're in this room.

172
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,394
No wounds that would imply
that she was stabbed.

173
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,647
- No, she wasn't stabbed.
- And no signs of sexual assault.

174
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,107
No, and you'd know that if you'd read
the report all the way through.

175
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,901
I swear to God, you fucking people.

176
00:12:58,654 --> 00:12:59,780
Excuse me?

177
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,075
I said "you," and I said "fucking,"
and I said "people."

178
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,118
I need to go finish my lunch, so...

179
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:09,039
It was great seeing ya, Sabich.
Enjoy the sights.

180
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:28,141
Liam Reynolds
has been watching Bunny Davis.

181
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:32,980
He knows that a $12 baggie of heroin
can get him anything he wants,

182
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,940
so he tricks her into his motel room.

183
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,485
And over the course of that week,
he keeps her high.

184
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:43,115
So high that he has to give her Narcan
on three different occasions

185
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,074
to revive her.

186
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:49,997
Bunny Davis dies three times
while she's with Reynolds.

187
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:54,126
And he revives her three times.

188
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,964
She's too drugged to resist,
but not so drugged she can't feel it.

189
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,550
And when he runs out of drugs

190
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,971
and can no longer sedate her,
he hog-ties her for three days.

191
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:10,642
Three days with a rope around your neck,
pulling you, choking you.

192
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:17,232
Bunny Davis was a daughter...

193
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,277
a sister...

194
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:23,197
a friend.

195
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,117
Bunny Davis was 26 years old

196
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,704
when she found herself
hog-tied in a dirty motel with a monster,

197
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,539
and she is praying-- pleading--

198
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,209
that this is the kind of man
who will just let her go.

199
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,378
But no.

200
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:47,054
This man, Liam Reynolds,
is the kind of man who does this...

201
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:52,726
and this...

202
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,397
<i>and this.</i>

203
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,071
You remember Bunny Davis?

204
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:06,949
Yeah.

205
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,618
Carolyn was tied up in a similar way.

206
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,954
All right.
Well, you think there's a connection?

207
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,789
<i>Apparently, Rusty thinks there's one.</i>

208
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,709
Yeah, but Liam Reynolds is in prison.

209
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,962
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

210
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,673
<i>Well, you know, it's not our case.</i>

211
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,466
Not yet.

212
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,776
I don't think this is our guy.

213
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,821
It's totally plausible

214
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:48,031
that he could have
gotten someone on the outside to do it.

215
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,324
That's a stretch.

216
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,869
Different MO.
The other victim was stabbed in the heart.

217
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,829
Carolyn was bludgeoned.

218
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,248
It was a fire poker, by the way.

219
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,626
Really?

220
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,545
Yeah, she had a whole
wrought-iron fireplace set.

221
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,755
Poker's missing.

222
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,465
It would match the wounds.

223
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,010
- Really?
- You're good.

224
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,429
Makes me think it just happened.
It wasn't planned.

225
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,097
It just happened? It was meticulous.

226
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,932
No, she was tied up meticulous.

227
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:15,934
Not so much the murder.

228
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,271
Sounds like something I'd do.

229
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,526
Sounds like something I'd enjoy.

230
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,447
So, am I a suspect?

231
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:38,165
I mean, hope so.

232
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,417
It's pretty fucking boring around here.

233
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,886
Will I get to go back to court,
put on a tie, dress up?

234
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,724
What, are you looking
for some kind of revelation?

235
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,142
{\an8}Fuck off.

236
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,900
She was about notches on her belt,
which I was one.

237
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:11,906
So, if you want a statement from me,
I got a statement for you. "Yippee."

238
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,992
Or no, here's a better one.

239
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:19,373
Here's a better one from me.
"What goes around comes around."

240
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,332
Are you done?

241
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,667
I'd gladly crater her skull.

242
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,257
You're a thoughtful guy, yeah?

243
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:30,467
Okay. So, let's just say,
for the sake of argument--

244
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,844
yours, not mine--

245
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:35,347
you're a thoughtful guy
serving a life sentence.

246
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,182
Not Carolyn's doing, by the way.

247
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,852
And that if you had
any information at all,

248
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,812
I think you might find it advantageous

249
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:45,315
that you're sitting across
from the chief deputy prosecutor.

250
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,233
What do you wanna do?

251
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,735
You wanna go keep doing whatever it is
that you're doing around here?

252
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,778
Let me ask you something.

253
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,114
Do you actually think

254
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:55,576
that I had something to do
with the death of your revered colleague?

255
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:59,162
I think that you would be intrigued

256
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,456
by the commonalities
between Bunny and her.

257
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,501
And that if you had anything
to share at all,

258
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,253
now might be an opportune time.

259
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,216
Carolyn Polhemus.

260
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,094
Carolyn Polhemus...

261
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,892
ruined my life.

262
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,729
You helped.

263
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,734
<i>We, the jury in the above-titled case,</i>

264
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:31,820
find the defendant, Liam Reynolds,
guilty of murder in the first degree.

265
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,156
Yes!

266
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,950
There's two things that I never forget.

267
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:42,748
Faces, and being fucked over!

268
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,935
<i>As beloved as Carolyn was,</i>

269
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,354
she also made a lot of enemies.

270
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,523
She was an unflinching prosecutor

271
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,733
who put a lot of very bad people
in prison.

272
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,652
<i>Some possibly looking to get even.</i>

273
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:15,113
<i>It's every prosecutor's worst fantasy</i>

274
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:18,116
that someone you convict
comes looking for revenge.

275
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:22,829
<i>Violent criminals with grudges
is not something you want to cultivate.</i>

276
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,669
Things aren't okay the way they are.
There's a lot of fear.

277
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,379
People don't feel safe,

278
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,757
<i>and people are anxious.
And they've got good reason to be,</i>

279
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:37,636
<i>because Raymond Horgan is not doing
a good-enough job of keeping things safe,</i>

280
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,889
and that's something
that we intend to change.

281
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:44,434
<i>And right now, people don't feel free
and they don't feel safe.</i>

282
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,272
<i>So, in two weeks, Chicago,
get out there and vote.</i>

283
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,445
Mr. Caldwell, I'm sorry for just
turning up like this.

284
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,823
- My name is Rusty Sabich.
- I know who you are.

285
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,410
Carolyn spoke of you.

286
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,498
I tried calling.

287
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,000
Police have already been here.

288
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,837
Could I just have a word with you?

289
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:29,897
<i>We divorced over nine years ago.
We haven't really kept in close touch.</i>

290
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,524
And do you know anything
about her personal life?

291
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:33,734
I do not.

292
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,485
Do you?

293
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,656
Her life was work,
so the people at her work

294
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,658
would be in a much better position
to know.

295
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,493
Really, the reason we divorced.

296
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,665
You worked quite closely with her,

297
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,042
from what I understand.

298
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,127
She was my number two.

299
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:56,048
I never knew that she had a child.

300
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,970
Yeah, sometimes what you don't know
can tell you everything.

301
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,144
Carolyn was a very
compartmentalized person.

302
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,566
I'm sure there are many things
about her that remain unknown to me.

303
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:19,988
Whatever I did see and know
is what she wanted seen and known.

304
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,993
If you're wondering whether I killed her,

305
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,329
the police have already
satisfied themselves that I didn't.

306
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,004
My son, Michael.

307
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,506
Mr. Sabich.

308
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:40,384
Hello, Michael. I'm sorry for your loss.

309
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:43,679
Thank you.

310
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,188
He's angry...

311
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:58,277
at the world, at his mother, at me.

312
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,198
His family unit failed.

313
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:06,243
I'm sure he blames me for that failure.

314
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,163
Okay, everyone. Let's get started.

315
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,375
Listen, I know that we're all struggling.

316
00:22:55,959 --> 00:23:00,839
We're going through some very hard times.

317
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:05,219
Carolyn was a really special person,
one of our core team.

318
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:07,054
Look, it's okay to hurt.

319
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:12,684
And it's okay if you can't carry on.

320
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:13,852
That's human nature.

321
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,772
But it's also human nature
to support each other.

322
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:20,108
You know, to be compassionate.

323
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,819
What's the-- What's--

324
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:25,864
Sorry.

325
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,912
What's the news on that front,
Carolyn's murder?

326
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,750
Well, we haven't gotten
the whole full path report.

327
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:42,840
On Carolyn's clothes and body,

328
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,176
there were minute fibers of a carpeting
that were not found in her apartment.

329
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,387
They were synthetic, milled domestically.

330
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:49,972
The color is called Scottish malt.

331
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,265
The dye lot hasn't been identified

332
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,475
and the fiber could be from either
industrial or domestic weave--

333
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,018
Color's called Scottish malt.

334
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,312
Narrows it down.

335
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:02,484
There was also probably no struggle
before she was killed,

336
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:05,279
so no sign of break-in, which suggests
that Carolyn knew her killer.

337
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,532
And the autopsy concludes
three blows to the head.

338
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:10,033
And what's this with the rope?

339
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:16,248
It's just standard half-inch,
American-made hemp.

340
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,417
Right. Which can be found almost anywhere.

341
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,044
Target, Walgreens, Home Depot.

342
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:26,175
So, when you say that this investigation
is nowhere, you really mean it.

343
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:28,010
Is that what you plan to report to Delay,

344
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,596
so you can call a press conference
and declare incompetence?

345
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:32,389
Your incompetence is on full parade today.

346
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:37,144
Wow, you really can be a real dick,
can't you, Tommy?

347
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:42,858
I guess this ends
the compassionate portion of the evening.

348
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:46,195
Tommy, can I talk to you?

349
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:57,748
What the fuck was that, Tommy?

350
00:24:57,748 --> 00:24:59,541
- What?
- You think that that's productive?

351
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,959
I wasn't aware
that's what we were going for.

352
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,336
- You know what?
- I know a lot.

353
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:05,631
Uh-uh. You know what, I'm tired
of your fucking insubordination, okay?

354
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:08,258
And if I find that you
have been blocking my investigation, I--

355
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,344
Blocking-- You have carpet fibers.

356
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:12,137
The case is basically solved.

357
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,263
Are you fucking kidding me?

358
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:14,765
You wanna take me on?

359
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,059
You wanna take me on?

360
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:19,269
- No.
- You think that would be a good idea?

361
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,939
How do you think
that'll work out for you, Tommy?

362
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,066
You're upset.

363
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,111
Yeah.

364
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:35,994
Fuck.

365
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:41,542
Mr. Sabich,
any comments on the Polhemus case?

366
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,126
I'm not at liberty to comment right now.

367
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,711
This is an ongoing investigation,

368
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:47,130
- <i>but I can tell you that this office...</i>
- Way to go, Rusty. Come on.

369
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,299
<i>...is hard at work,
and Raymond Horgan is very hard at work.</i>

370
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:53,178
And the idea
that we're doing nothing is offensive.

371
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:57,182
I mean, I understand that that's an idea
that Nico Della Guardia wants to convey

372
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:59,476
because it's politically advantageous
for him to stoke fear.

373
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:02,604
{\an8}<i>But Nico Della Guardia hasn't tried an
actual case in this courtroom for years.</i>

374
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,064
- <i>He pleads everything out.</i>
- Get 'em!

375
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,900
<i>His methodology of choice
is to just stall and stall and stall</i>

376
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,527
{\an8}<i>until the defendant's lawyers have to quit</i>

377
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:09,945
<i>'cause their clients
can't pay them anymore.</i>

378
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,364
<i>It's one thing to be a hack.
It's another thing to be dishonorable.</i>

379
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:13,448
<i>But to be both is--</i>

380
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:17,077
{\an8}<i>Nico Della Guardia is known around here
as Nico "Delay" Guardia</i>

381
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,662
<i>because he stalls and he pleads out.</i>

382
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:20,914
{\an8}<i>And just one last thing.
Just one last thing.</i>

383
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,417
<i>If you were headed down a dark alley
and danger lay ahead,</i>

384
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,127
<i>who would you want in your corner?</i>

385
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:26,170
<i>A pleader and a staller...</i>

386
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,754
- That little fuck.
- <i>...like Nico Della Guardia,</i>

387
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,214
{\an8}<i>or a fighter like Raymond Horgan?</i>

388
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,555
<i>Please don't tell me
you're personally handling Carolyn's case.</i>

389
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:39,433
Right?

390
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:44,313
Rusty?

391
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:48,901
Raymond asked me to.

392
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:57,576
Raymond asked you to.

393
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:05,584
If I don't take it, then it falls
to Tommy Molto, who will do nothing

394
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:09,004
because this going unsolved
dooms Raymond's chances of reelection.

395
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:14,259
I mean, should Della Guardia win,
then he'll give Tommy my job, by the way.

396
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,556
And what if it gets out...

397
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,772
That you two were involved.

398
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,401
I mean, what's that gonna do to your case,

399
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:35,322
your career and our kids?

400
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,035
Me?

401
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:45,541
It has been over for so long
between me and Carolyn.

402
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,838
I just need two weeks,
because between now and the primary,

403
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,215
Raymond needs there to be a case, Barbara.

404
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:56,218
And I am the only one
in the position to deliver that.

405
00:27:57,261 --> 00:27:59,972
What, he can't find
a prosecutor who hasn't slept with her?

406
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,439
I'm sorry.

407
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,294
Our marriage barely survived this.

408
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:36,258
I barely survived this.

409
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,054
I know you, Rusty.

410
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:46,685
You will disappear into this case.

411
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:53,942
You will disappear and you will go silent.

412
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,037
And that'll break me.

413
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,051
My father cheated on my mother...

414
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:06,723
and...

415
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:13,397
I swore to myself
that I would never do that.

416
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:24,032
And now I'm here.

417
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:31,164
Why do you think it happened?

418
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:39,214
I don't know.
You know, it wasn't about the sex.

419
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:43,886
I mean, it became about that.

420
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:47,556
But I mean, with Barbara,
that's what it was at first.

421
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:49,808
I mean, B and I met when we were 20.

422
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,268
She was pregnant six months later,

423
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,854
and then there was Jaden
and then there was Kyle.

424
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,566
And so we were just-- we were in.

425
00:30:57,566 --> 00:31:00,777
When we laid down to bed,
you know, we lay with all of our worries.

426
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:04,114
You know, the kids' troubles at school,
my caseload.

427
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,367
<i>With Carolyn, it was just pure.</i>

428
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:11,163
She just woke me up, you know?

429
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:17,753
<i>She was funny and strong,
and she was brilliant, Carolyn.</i>

430
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:19,463
<i>Just fucking brilliant.</i>

431
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:24,551
You know what I can't make sense of,
and maybe you can help me understand?

432
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:30,182
There was something
about that first encounter...

433
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:33,852
<i>I just keep thinking about.</i>

434
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:36,897
I mean, maybe what she
was drawn to wasn't just me.

435
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:40,025
Meaning?

436
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,239
Do you think she was drawn to your power?

437
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,579
Well, that doesn't sound very loving.

438
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,216
But it was.

439
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:11,473
I'm trying to teach you something.

440
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:13,100
- You're not listening.
- I'm trying to learn.

441
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,394
- You're not listening.
- I'm half listening.

442
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:18,105
Kind of miss the old days,

443
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:22,025
where, if two consenting adults wanted to
touch each other, they could just touch.

444
00:32:42,671 --> 00:32:44,882
We were very physical.

445
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:47,968
She was very aggressive.

446
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:51,054
<i>She liked it when I was aggressive.</i>

447
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,973
You're talking about the sex now?

448
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:02,274
And sometimes when Carolyn and I
would engage in ways

449
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:05,027
that B and I never did,

450
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:07,029
<i>Carolyn would look at me
and she would say,</i>

451
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:09,948
"Does Barbara do this for you?"

452
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:14,786
Almost like she wanted to bring her
into the bed with us.

453
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:18,123
Like she wanted her to be in bed with us.

454
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:22,127
Like she wanted one more witness
to what I was willing to lose.

455
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,425
Is that a sentiment
that you've shared with Barbara?

456
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:31,970
Don't.

457
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:41,104
<i>Does Barbara do this for you?</i>

458
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,545
Fuck.

459
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:05,629
Fuck!

460
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,259
I can't stop thinking about her.

461
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,130
Della Guardia.

462
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:51,341
Thank you.

463
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:52,634
What--

464
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:58,390
What a wonderful night.

465
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:05,606
But look, let's remember, friends,
only the beginning.

466
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:13,614
I would also like to thank

467
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:18,410
my wonderful friend and noble adversary,
Raymond Horgan.

468
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,037
{\an8}<i>Thank you-- No.</i>

469
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:24,875
{\an8}<i>He has served this city
so faithfully for so long.</i>

470
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,461
<i>- But wonderful and noble.</i>
- So faithfully for so long.

471
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:29,171
<i>He's my dear friend Raymond.</i>

472
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:31,507
- My dear friend Raymond.
- <i>My heart and love go out to him.</i>

473
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:33,550
{\an8}<i>So, Raymond Horgan, thank you, please.</i>

474
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:35,594
{\an8}<i>Yeah.</i>

475
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:38,639
{\an8}<i>But you know, look,</i>

476
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,558
<i>that's the past and we're here for the...</i>

477
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:43,310
<i>Future!</i>

478
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,270
Does this mean you're out tonight?

479
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:49,566
I mean, I still have a job,
but I'm not chief deputy prosecutor.

480
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:51,068
That's Tommy, right?

481
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:52,861
Yes. It's Tommy Molto.

482
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:54,655
<i>...are you with me?</i>

483
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,365
- Fuck 'em.
- <i>Okay, yeah.</i>

484
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:57,574
- Kyle.
- Fuck them.

485
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:59,201
Honestly, I mean, look at 'em.

486
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,994
I mean, he's not wrong.

487
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:03,288
You wouldn't wanna be there
with these guys in charge.

488
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:06,291
Okay. Well, where would I go?

489
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:08,293
What would I do?

490
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:11,922
What about the case?

491
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:15,551
I don't know.

492
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:33,485
How'd it go with Dr. Rush?

493
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:34,903
You would have liked it.

494
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:37,322
She completely took your side.

495
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:40,033
Of course she did. I'm the "cuckoldee."

496
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,834
I am sorry about the election...

497
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:52,504
and your job.

498
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,257
I'm almost relieved, you know?

499
00:36:57,092 --> 00:36:58,719
Thank you for sticking by me.

500
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,016
It's not lost on me that I'm, you know...

501
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:07,728
The stickiest?

502
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:14,234
You know, I'm not tragically dependent.

503
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:17,154
I could have left.

504
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:20,199
I could have moved on. I still could.

505
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:27,164
The reason I haven't is we have a family...

506
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:33,921
and if I'm desperate for anything,
it's to preserve that.

507
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,304
And I love you.

508
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:45,557
There's that.

509
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:51,688
I will fight-- You and I will fight--

510
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:56,527
to save what we have
because we have got a lot.

511
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:06,745
But you need to stop loving her.

512
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:14,378
You need to stop loving her.

513
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:46,785
<i>I called Nico.</i>

514
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:51,665
<i>Congratulated him on both his victory
and a race well-fought.</i>

515
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:55,252
<i>I also told him that I would be
stepping down immediately,</i>

516
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:58,922
<i>as it will allow him
to enjoy a bit of incumbency</i>

517
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,799
<i>before the general election.</i>

518
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,052
<i>Add to that, a lame-duck prosecutor</i>

519
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:06,722
<i>really can't serve
the best interests of our city.</i>

520
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:16,440
Rigo, hey.

521
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,901
Hey, how you doing?

522
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:21,945
- I don't know.
- Yeah. Well, sorry.

523
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:24,156
What are you doing here?

524
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:26,533
Hall and Oates
want a debrief on some cases.

525
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:28,493
Some cases?

526
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,246
Hey, you gonna hang in okay?

527
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,291
- Always.
- See ya.

528
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,054
Yeah.

529
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:48,889
- Hey.
- Hey.

530
00:39:50,557 --> 00:39:52,976
Wow, couldn't get out of here
fast enough, huh?

531
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:57,397
Yeah. Well, if you believe the press,
I don't really have that much time here.

532
00:39:57,397 --> 00:40:00,067
It's like a champion stud
going out to pasture.

533
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:03,111
If only the stud part still worked.

534
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:05,322
You ready?

535
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:06,698
What, for pasture?

536
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:07,783
No, for this meeting.

537
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:10,494
With Tweedledum and Tweedledumber.

538
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:16,750
Okay.

539
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:20,128
You've seen the look on my face. Happy?

540
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:23,173
Please. Come on, Raymond. Take a seat.

541
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:25,717
You too, Rusty. And close the door.

542
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,601
First off, I just wanna thank you
for your gracious remarks last night.

543
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:36,979
They were very moving, very kind.

544
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:38,355
Fuck off.

545
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,280
Your previous public comments, however,
saddened me.

546
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,616
Sorry you feel that way.

547
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:56,039
So, Tommy's gonna assume the role
of chief deputy prosecutor,

548
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,541
effective immediately.

549
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:00,294
It goes without saying,
you'll just pass on your case list

550
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:03,213
and charging notes and calendar files,
and blah-blah-blah.

551
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:08,010
And then given the compounding public
interest in the Carolyn Polhemus case--

552
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,763
The fire you flamed like a shameless fuck?

553
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:16,935
Where are we on that?

554
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:19,938
I mean, I gave Tommy the full report.

555
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:21,690
Actually, I don't think you did.

556
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,567
There's a couple things are missing here.

557
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:24,526
Like what?

558
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:26,695
The fingerprint analysis, for starters.

559
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:27,988
I'm still waiting on that.

560
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:31,909
It's available.

561
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:37,247
So you have been tampering?

562
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:40,167
Well, I mean, it's my investigation now.

563
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:48,383
Several sets of fingerprints were found
in her apartment, including yours.

564
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:51,261
So, when was the last time
you were in Carolyn's apartment?

565
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:53,597
I was at the scene following her death.

566
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:57,059
But you were gloved up, right?

567
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:59,186
And your fingerprints
were found in her bedroom.

568
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:00,604
No one saw you enter that room.

569
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:02,773
So, when was the last time
you were in Carolyn's apartment

570
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:03,941
prior to the murder?

571
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:08,237
We had cases together-- trials--
and sometimes we would work after hours,

572
00:42:08,237 --> 00:42:10,280
and sometimes
we would be at her apartment.

573
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,157
So you discussed cases at her apartment?

574
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:15,452
We were work colleagues.

575
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:24,670
So, I looked at Carolyn's call logs
on her cell phone.

576
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:28,799
- You two had quite a few calls together.
- What is the point of this?

577
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:30,259
The point is, I'm trying to find out

578
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,553
when the last time you were in
Carolyn's apartment prior to the murder.

579
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:35,013
And you said
that you worked on cases together there.

580
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:37,516
Do I need a lawyer present
at this meeting?

581
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:43,522
What was the last case
the two of you worked on together?

582
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:45,524
I'm sorry,
am I under criminal investigation here?

583
00:42:45,524 --> 00:42:47,776
Listen, I'm the new
chief deputy prosecutor.

584
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:50,529
I'm looking to be briefed
by the former chief deputy.

585
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:52,155
I have questions.

586
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:53,490
It's normal.

587
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:02,249
Were you and Carolyn
romantically involved?

588
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:09,548
You want me to repeat the question?

589
00:43:12,843 --> 00:43:17,681
My personal relationship
with Carolyn Polhemus

590
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,101
is not relevant to this investigation.

591
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,228
Are you shitting me?

592
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:32,196
- You're a hack, Tommy.
- Hey, Rusty.

593
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:36,200
I certainly stand corrected for having
accused you of incompetence

594
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,159
in this investigation.

595
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:38,702
Seems it was deliberate,
bordering on artful.

596
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,204
- You're a fucking hack, Tommy.
- Hey, maybe--

597
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:41,163
You're a fucking hack.

598
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:44,082
Rusty,
maybe you should keep your mouth shut.

599
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,043
Here's the thing.

600
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:51,673
Full path report came back
on Carolyn's murder and she was pregnant.

601
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:57,679
Were you aware that Carolyn was pregnant
at the time of the murder?

602
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:04,436
No.

603
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:06,605
Do you have any idea
who the father might be?
