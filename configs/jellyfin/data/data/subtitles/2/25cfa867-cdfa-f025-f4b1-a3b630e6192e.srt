1
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,370
I don't want to go... Arjun.

2
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,410
Come on, Meera...

3
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,450
Okay, chill.

4
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,450
We'll just have a couple of drinks. - No.

5
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,660
Okay, give me one reason... - Mrs. Duggal.

6
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,700
One...

7
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,750
I didn't even complete my sentence.

8
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,000
Mrs. Duggal.

9
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,450
All she can ever talk about is Delhi versus Bangalore.

10
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,330
It's like I've had the same conversation with her a million times.

11
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,370
Come on, she's sweet.

12
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,580
You're just saying that...

13
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,790
...because you know she has a crush on you.

14
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,410
That is... - True.

15
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,540
Insane.

16
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,540
That's just nonsense.

17
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,540
Please, Arjun. Please.

18
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,700
You know, Meera, just because you don't want to go...

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,080
...stop making stupid excuses.

20
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,540
She likes you.

21
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,660
Nothing wrong in that.

22
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,540
You're a good looking guy. Even I like you.

23
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,540
Yeah. Okay.

24
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,830
Let's go back? - Please, Meera.

25
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:14,450
Come on.

26
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,790
Okay, what will we do back at home?

27
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,580
Well, we'll watch a movie. - Movie?

28
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,660
That one.

29
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,410
That 'type' of movie!

30
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,410
That 'type' of movie!

31
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,040
Remember the last movie we watched...

32
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,660
That Tamil movie.

33
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,620
What was that line? That party line.

34
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,870
I know you mugged that up.

35
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,580
Shut up, Arjun. - Say it.

36
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,910
No. - Say, otherwise I'll say it badly.

37
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:41,660
Party...party...

38
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,080
Focus on the road.

39
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,080
How much further? - We've arrived.

40
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,200
Last chance.

41
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,790
S**** the party.

42
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,750
Let's go home and make mad love.

43
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,750
Now say it like that...

44
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,040
S**** the party. Let's go home and make mad love.

45
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,870
We'll make a quick exit. Promise.

46
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,750
That one, right?

47
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:54,370
Oh s***. I left my phone in the car.

48
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,370
What would I do without you?

49
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,040
You've been smoking again?

50
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,040
No...

51
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,580
Bangalore is nice and pleasant, so...

52
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,830
Bangalore is so IT-IT, Meera.

53
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,830
And the bars shut at 11:30. I mean, look at Delhi!

54
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,330
Thank you.

55
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,330
Is Arjun that much fun when he's sober?

56
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,910
Yeah.

57
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,910
Sorry, I'll just take that. - Sure.

58
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,750
Yeah, Vinay?

59
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,750
I'm sorry, guys. Can I just steal him for a minute?

60
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,160
Baby, listen. Don't be upset, but...

61
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,910
Oh, Meera, come on! This is the third time!

62
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:20,750
I'll have to go.

63
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:21,910
Some s**** up with the test batch.

64
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,120
I'll tell you on the way.

65
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,410
Ask Vinay to handle it.

66
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,000
He's the one who called.

67
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,330
Call Shruti. I mean, there must be something she can do...

68
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,000
Baby, can we just go please? I'll be late.

69
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,000
All well, you guys?

70
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,830
Yes of course. Office emergency. Have to go.

71
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,750
You don't work for the fire brigade, do you?

72
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,700
Product launch. Can't help it.

73
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,410
Right, then. I'll drop you home.

74
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,910
Yeah, great. Rajeev will drop you home.

75
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,910
Are you coming now, or with Rajeev?

76
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,540
Call me when you get there.

77
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,540
"Going down"

78
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,040
Go, man!

79
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,700
Jabber jabber jabber jabber!

80
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,450
Sir. We're investigating. in the area.

81
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,870
Madam!

82
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,120
If you had noted their registration number, the matter would've been simple.

83
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,790
Actually, it all happened so fast that...

84
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,200
So none of these, madam?

85
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,370
No.

86
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,790
This city's like a growing child, sir. It's bound to act funny at times.

87
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,790
Why do you let her travel alone at night?

88
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,410
You're friends with the DIG of Police.

89
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,660
Why not get her a gun license then?

90
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,660
Gun?

91
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,040
What do you think? Should we get a gun?

92
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,830
Sure. The city's a growing child, after all.

93
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,250
I'll have to get a gun.

94
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,790
Okay. I'll talk to him.

95
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,790
Let's apply for a license, then we'll see.

96
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,950
Are you okay, ma'am?

97
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,250
So even if we assume...

98
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,540
...a conservative 5 year time frame to come to 50%...

99
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,080
...of China's per capita consumption of female hygiene products...

100
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,120
...we are talking about an annualized growth rate of...

101
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,410
...28% in this segment.

102
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,040
Moving on to the brand name...

103
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,370
The key insight from our qualitative research...

104
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,200
...was that in a majority of cases...

105
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,950
...the purchase of the product is conducted by the kids of the household.

106
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:00,040
Chemist shops in Tier-2 and rural markets are manned mostly by men.

107
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,540
Women find it embarrassing to buy the product across the counter.

108
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,580
While the men of the household think that it's beneath their honour.

109
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,540
Only in India!

110
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,540
So in most cases, it is the child who is sent to buy the product.

111
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,830
Which means...

112
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,200
The name of our product has to be something easily remembered by a child.

113
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,080
And from the shortlisted names, the one with the maximum recall...

114
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,620
...in a sample set of 800 kids was...

115
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,620
'Saathi' (Buddy).

116
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,080
Well done, Meera. Great job!

117
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,660
All right, everyone. Let's sleep over it.

118
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,660
I think Meera has to leave now.

119
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,750
Well, I've got a key insight too...

120
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,660
Women employees tend to have it easy with their bosses.

121
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,330
Technically speaking, that's an observation, Vinay.

122
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,330
Not an insight. Don't they teach you that at IIM?

123
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,540
Happy birthday in advance, Meera ma'am! Have a nice trip!

124
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,540
Thank you! Have a nice weekend!

125
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,000
Give me two minutes, for God's sake. - You've been saying that for 10 minutes now.

126
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,000
There's nobody here. - But I'll get in trouble with the boss.

127
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,330
There. I'm leaving.

128
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:12,330
Madam, you know the rules.

129
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,580
Poor guy. He's just doing his job.

130
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,750
Sorry.

131
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,000
Sorry! Not bad...

132
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,830
Just trying to impress you.

133
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,830
Nice try, then.

134
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,660
This time, I remembered everything.

135
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,870
What?

136
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,080
Your bag, my bag...

137
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,620
Gave our keys to the maid...

138
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,580
Did you make a checklist?

139
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,160
Yeah. I always make a checklist.

140
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,950
Just so that I don't forget anything.

141
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,580
How about the water bottle?

142
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,830
Oh damn! The water bottle!

143
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,830
You have made checklist, huh?

144
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,950
Why are those lanes blocked?

145
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,290
Move ahead, what are you looking at!

146
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,870
Stop waiting around!

147
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,870
These office people are not going to leave me alone.

148
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,620
Why are these lanes closed?

149
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,540
There were four of them in a Pajero...

150
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,870
The attendant asked them for the toll...

151
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,830
So?

152
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,830
They shot him.

153
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,580
What was that?

154
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,290
What did he say?

155
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,700
Nothing. Some random fight.

156
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,700
Yes, I'm going!

157
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,410
The weather today is just like your mood.

158
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,950
Sunny one moment, gloomy the next...

159
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,950
And right after that... romantic.

160
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,950
Sometimes romantic!

161
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,450
Need some water.

162
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,500
I'm so sorry, darling.

163
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,830
Pass me the map.

164
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,830
Map?

165
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,580
Water! Where did that come from?

166
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,910
You don't know. I've no idea!

167
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,910
Oh, my God!

168
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,370
For your birthday.

169
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,410
Go on. Light one.

170
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,410
What's up with you today?

171
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,620
Why are you grinning so much?

172
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,450
I'm not grinning.

173
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,700
By the way...

174
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,870
I've booked a private villa for us.

175
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,540
Wow! Impressed.

176
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,660
Private... villa.

177
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,540
Oh, I see!

178
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,540
It's my birthday, but you want it to be your lucky day!

179
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,200
How does that work, Arjun?

180
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,160
Return present.

181
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,080
Return gift!

182
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,080
Return gift!

183
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,790
It's this turn, on the right.

184
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,660
The map says it's the next one.

185
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,830
I say it's this one.

186
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:33,950
Let's ask someone.

187
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,950
Trust me this is the bypass road.

188
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,540
You men! You'll die but ask for directions.

189
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Come on, Arjun. I don't want to be lost here all night.

190
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,040
Let's ask someone here.

191
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:12,290
Excuse me, where does this road go?

192
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:19,290
This road doesn't go anywhere buddy, it stays right here.

193
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:25,080
No, I meant... Is this the Basantpura bypass?

194
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,080
Yes.

195
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,910
How far from here?

196
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,910
Want me to carry you there in my arms?

197
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,660
Where are you going? Basantpura?

198
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,660
Sorry.

199
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,160
I told you. This is the turn.

200
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,250
You okay?

201
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,250
Yeah.

202
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,160
You women. Can't even read maps.

203
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,290
You feeling hungry?

204
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,660
Let's stop somewhere?

205
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,660
Yeah, sure.

206
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,870
Bloody idiots.

207
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,910
Why pick my car if you want to die?

208
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,910
Nutcases!

209
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,580
What are you doing?

210
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,410
You promised you'd always keep it in your handbag.

211
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,410
But you're with me today, aren't you?

212
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,790
Hey, Arjun. I... I didn't mean it that way.

213
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:57,830
It's just very heavy.

214
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,950
Mom's calling.

215
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,790
Yes, ma.

216
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:09,450
Yeah, we've left. In fact, halfway there already.

217
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,410
Yes, we'll be there before night falls.

218
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,410
Okay, ma. The battery's low. I'll call you tomorrow.

219
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,410
What else would you like?

220
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,540
W****

221
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,830
Sister...

222
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,830
Please help us.

223
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,660
Sorry - They'll kill my husband and me...

224
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,660
Please, sister. We really need help - Sorry.

225
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,660
Get out of my way, please.

226
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,700
Ordered some curry and roti. Okay with you?

227
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,700
You okay?

228
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,370
Mukesh!

229
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:08,370
Catch him!

230
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,500
Brother, let me go!

231
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,540
Arjun!

232
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,540
Arjun, what are you doing?

233
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,660
Pinky!

234
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,370
Mukesh!

235
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,000
Boss, what's the problem?

236
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,000
Stay away. She's my sister.

237
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,660
Put him in the back of the car.

238
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,450
Open the door!

239
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,620
What the hell is he doing?

240
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,580
Chhotey, open the door!

241
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,120
You want a slap? Open the damn car.

242
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,370
Come here, kiddo. Come to me!

243
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,370
Shut it, quick!

244
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,830
Boss...

245
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,830
What did I just tell you, you c***? That's my sister!

246
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,910
Arjun, please slow down.

247
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,410
You did the right thing.

248
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,450
You stood up for them. - Stop it, Meera.

249
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,500
I mean it. Everyone else was just standing around...

250
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,500
I said, stop it Meera. Please!

251
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,040
Listen, if this is how it's going to be then let's not even go.

252
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,330
Arjun?!

253
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:06,410
Arjun, what are you doing?

254
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:10,410
Arjun!

255
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:21,950
What is wrong with you? What are you doing?

256
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:28,290
Have you gone mad? You're taking this too far.

257
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,790
Baby listen, please don't do this.

258
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,660
Why are you doing this, Arjun?

259
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,410
Don't turn this into an ego issue.

260
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,450
Don't be stupid.

261
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,450
Let's just leave, please. Why are we getting into this?

262
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,910
Okay, listen, stop the car.

263
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,200
I don't want to go. Stop the car, I'm leaving.

264
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,160
Are you f****** insane or what?

265
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,830
There were 5-6 of them. Are you mad?

266
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,120
Please don't do this!

267
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,830
Don't just...

268
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,870
Please, let's just...

269
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:10,700
Arjun, don't do this.

270
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,660
You're really scaring me, man.

271
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,580
Arjun, please don't do this. I swear I will never talk to you again.

272
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
Meera, just relax, okay.

273
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,450
Arjun, please!!

274
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,120
I'm with you today, am I not?

275
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,250
Listen. I didn't mean it like that. Is that why you're doing this?

276
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:34,040
Relax. They're just some village idiots. I'm just going to scare them a bit.

277
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:34,910
No, don't!

278
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,290
Teach them a few manners, you know?

279
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,500
Why are you even doing this?

280
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,540
Arjun, no!

281
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,540
Just stay in the car. Lock the doors.

282
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,830
You're such an idiot, Arjun!

283
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,790
Brother. Let go.

284
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:08,410
Brother. Let me go.

285
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,410
Let us go, brother.

286
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,870
Have you seen a man in a blue jacket?

287
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,370
Is this your car?

288
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,330
Did you see him go by? He was wearing a blue jacket with a sweater inside?

289
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,620
Can I drive it?

290
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,620
First tell me, did you see a man?

291
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,950
S***! S***! S***! S***!

292
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,000
Where did he go?

293
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,540
Where did you see him?

294
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,000
Tell me, which way did he go?

295
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,000
Which way?

296
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,370
Lier!

297
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:54,700
Brother, please...I'm sorry.

298
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,040
Thank God you at least remember your brother.

299
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:01,410
Forgive us...we were wrong.

300
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,620
Thrash him.

301
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,410
Break his leg.

302
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:11,410
Hit him harder.

303
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,950
Break his leg.

304
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,950
Mukesh...

305
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,120
Brother, let me go.

306
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,870
You want to be Juliet, huh?

307
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,870
You want to be Juliet, huh?

308
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,370
Give it to her! Cut her throat!

309
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,830
You've run a lot. Time to rest.

310
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,830
Don't give her poison! Slit her throat with the sickle!

311
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,910
Rest now.

312
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,330
Rest now.

313
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:02,330
Arjun!

314
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:08,000
Arjun!

315
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,540
Where the hell are you, man?

316
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,540
Arjun!

317
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,790
Arjun! Oh my God, are you okay?

318
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,540
We have to leave. Quick!

319
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,500
What happened? - These guys are f****** butchers.

320
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,950
What happened?

321
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:44,950
I told you not to go!

322
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,580
Arjun, no, no, no! It's okay. He's okay.

323
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,290
Move aside.

324
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,500
Move aside.

325
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,290
Arjun, he's like a child.

326
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,500
They're all animals.

327
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,500
They're all animals.

328
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,660
I'll shoot you.

329
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,000
Move out of my way!

330
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,000
Arjun!!!

331
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,830
Chhotey! Hey, stop!

332
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:33,620
You'll get hurt. Get out of there, kid.

333
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,000
Let him fool around a bit.

334
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,000
He's a kid. I've to be careful with him.

335
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,870
I'd made a call to Delhi.

336
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,790
The DIG of Police.

337
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:54,120
He's my friend. Anant Sahai.

338
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,120
You can check.

339
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:04,830
Everyone saw you at the restaurant. Someone or the other will report it.

340
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,040
The cops must be on their way.

341
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:12,700
We'll see. Where's your phone?

342
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,700
In the car, is it?

343
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,700
You're making a mistake.

344
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,660
I told you, we're not reporters.

345
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,620
We're not journalists.

346
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,830
Who are you then? Why did you follow us?

347
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,830
To watch the show?

348
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:30,540
Look, buddy...

349
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,160
You hit me, didn't you? And that got me angry.

350
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:40,750
We were both wrong. Let's just drop it now.

351
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,750
We're sorry, brother. Please...

352
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,500
Okay, listen...

353
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,870
You want money?

354
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:57,370
If you say another word, I'll cut your tongue out.

355
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:02,580
Brother, please let us go. We won't say a word. Promise, brother.

356
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,910
Cut that out.

357
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,290
It's not a great day for sisters.

358
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,290
Understand?

359
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,870
Pinky...

360
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,500
Mukesh...

361
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,500
Pinky...

362
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,200
Pinky...

363
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,200
Pinky...

364
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,540
Pinky...

365
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,540
Brother...

366
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,910
Oh my God!

367
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,910
He shot her!

368
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,660
It's okay, it's okay. Close your eyes.

369
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,290
Oh my God! He shot her, Arjun!

370
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:42,200
Empty the rest in that b******.

371
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,830
Oh, brother!

372
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:47,830
If a gun was what you wanted to use, why did you call the rest of us?

373
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,200
That's how you do it.

374
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,660
That's more like a man.

375
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,660
Go on. Finish him.

376
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:45,370
He's dead. Now grab him and get on with it.

377
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,250
Finished?

378
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:56,410
Yeah, man. We aren't digging for oil here.

379
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:00,790
Hey, Ashok. Where's the kerosene?

380
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,370
That's in the car.

381
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,580
Go and get it!

382
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,580
Let me catch my breath for a bit.

383
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,700
They're going to kill us.

384
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,500
They're going to kill us. We're going to die.

385
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,370
Chhotey! Come here, kiddo.

386
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:18,160
We'll have to kill them.

387
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,330
There's no other solution.

388
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,500
Alright, we'll kill them. But what about the car?

389
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,750
He has that friend in Bahaduragadh.

390
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,040
Yes. Satpal. We'll sell it to him.

391
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,500
I'll tell you what...

392
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:36,620
Kill the guy and bury him here. Let me deal with the girl.

393
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,540
Come on, old man. Is that what we're here for?

394
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,660
All you're thinking about is the freaking girl.

395
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,160
They'll sell your car.

396
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,080
They know someone in Bahaduragadh. They'll sell your car there.

397
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,540
What does he mean?

398
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,540
They're going to kill us.

399
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,700
We have to get out of here.

400
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:26,950
Take the flower. Take it.

401
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,910
Ask for the gun now.

402
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,080
Chhotey...

403
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,950
Can I have the gun?

404
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:44,700
Please, Chhotey. Give me the gun.

405
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,950
It's mine.

406
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:51,620
Your car...

407
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,580
Give me the car keys.

408
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,080
We can't.

409
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,080
Please do it, baby. Just give it.

410
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,200
Your turn now.

411
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,200
Give me the gun.

412
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,120
Come on, please.

413
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,910
Give me the keys back now.

414
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,870
Don't move. Stop!

415
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:21,080
Take it easy...

416
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,500
The keys, Chhotey.

417
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,580
Let me handle it. Chhotey, give them the keys.

418
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,290
Come on, give it to me. - I won't.

419
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,750
It's me, brother. Won't you listen to me?

420
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:29,750
It's mine.

421
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,540
I'll get you another car.

422
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,410
That's what you say every time. All talk, just talk.

423
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,000
I swear to you, my brother.

424
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,580
Give them the key.

425
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:39,750
It's mine!

426
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:40,750
Give me the key.

427
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,540
Chhotey, give them the key.

428
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,540
You mad b******, give me the key!

429
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:52,250
He shot him!

430
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,040
Arjun, run. Run, Arjun!

431
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,950
The b****** shot the kid!

432
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,080
Oh, Chhotey!

433
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,580
My brother!

434
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,870
Wake up, kid! Your brother's going to die without you.

435
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,160
Omi!

436
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,410
He was just a child.

437
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:11,410
You can continue to mourn here, and help them escape!

438
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:17,540
We'll get them, Omi.

439
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,540
Still holding on to that key. Stubborn mule!

440
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,120
Did he die?

441
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,120
We need to find help.

442
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,580
I don't think he's dead.

443
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,830
Come on, baby.

444
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,750
We need to get to a police station.

445
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,750
Yes. Anant Sahai will sort it all out.

446
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,910
S***. My phone.

447
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,370
We need to break the glass.

448
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:15,620
Yeah yeah yeah. I'll look for a stone.

449
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,580
Arjun!

450
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,910
They're here!

451
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,620
Arjun!

452
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,000
They have a gun...

453
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,540
Arjun!

454
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,830
Leave it, Arjun. Let's go!

455
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:31,830
They're getting away! After them, quick!

456
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,750
Come on. We're nearly there.

457
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:03,580
Arjun run, Arjun run!

458
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,580
There's the road.

459
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,120
Stop a car.

460
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,120
Stop!

461
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,750
Watch that gun.

462
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:16,830
Stop someone!

463
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:19,410
That's what I'm doing.

464
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:20,500
Stop!

465
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,870
Stop!

466
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:27,500
Stop someone!

467
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,450
What are you afraid of? Go ahead.

468
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,660
He'll shoot us, uncle. He's got that gun.

469
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,750
Come on, Meera!

470
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,330
I am trying!

471
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:38,330
Get them.

472
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,750
Arjun!

473
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,750
Go! Go!

474
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,500
Are you done with your stunts?

475
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,540
Can we go catch them now?

476
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,540
Shut up for God's sake! I just lost my freaking brother.

477
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,700
Oh, s***! They're coming!

478
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,700
Run, faster!

479
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,000
Run, you jerk. Run all you can. I'm not letting you go today.

480
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,290
Ramotar! There goes the girl.

481
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:25,040
Get the b****!

482
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:29,040
Get the b****!

483
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,120
This way!

484
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,500
Where did she go?

485
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,540
Couldn't have gone far. She must be here somewhere.

486
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,200
This seems like such a bad idea now.

487
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,950
Let's go.

488
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:19,000
You s****ed my freaking day, Ashok.

489
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,750
How's that?

490
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:24,370
Running around in the freaking jungle. Haven't even had my dinner.

491
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:27,540
Let's check here.

492
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,370
That way.

493
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:35,290
Over there.

494
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:39,290
Further ahead.

495
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:10,870
Arjun, find me. Find me, Arjun.

496
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:13,080
Got you, you prick.

497
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:31,330
Satbir!

498
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:38,120
S***! Arjun!

499
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:43,750
Meera, shoot!

500
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,000
Fauji! Satbir!

501
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:07,040
I'm going to pull it out.

502
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:38,830
Come on, baby!

503
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,500
You wanted us to spread out, didn't you?

504
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,370
Have a look now, old man!

505
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:04,120
And guess what? This one wasn't even a retard!

506
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,830
Shut up, all of you!

507
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:10,830
Squabbling here like monkeys while those two make merry!

508
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:26,080
They couldn't have gone too far.

509
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:45,040
I can't walk any more.

510
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,040
Just a little bit further.

511
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,910
There must be a village nearby. A police station, maybe.

512
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:23,910
We just need to get there.

513
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,120
Arjun, get up.

514
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:33,500
Come on, baby. Get up.

515
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,040
See, we're right there.

516
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:39,040
That's it. We're right there.

517
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,160
Arjun, baby.

518
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:49,040
I'm going to find help. I'll be back soon, I promise.

519
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,000
Arjun, look at me.

520
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,580
Promise me you'll wait here.

521
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,330
Say "Promise."

522
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,830
Promise!

523
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:02,500
Money...

524
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,500
Do you have any money?

525
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,660
Baby, your watch.

526
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:15,910
Take this.

527
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:18,200
Listen to me. Baby, listen to me.

528
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:23,830
If they come, you can scare them off with this, right?

529
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:27,830
Arjun, wake up! No sleeping!

530
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:32,500
Arjun, look at me.

531
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,700
Look at me.

532
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:38,370
Don't sleep. Keep looking at me.

533
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:40,540
Listen...

534
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,540
S**** the party. Let's go home and make mad love.

535
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,540
My lucky day, eh?

536
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,750
Nothing's going to happen to you.

537
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,620
I'll be back soon, I promise. Nothing's going to happen to you.

538
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:12,080
You'll stay right here. Say, "Promise."

539
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,750
Promise, baby, promise.

540
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:17,750
Nothing's going to happen to you, baby.

541
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,580
Meera...

542
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,580
Happy birthday!

543
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:59,200
Stop!

544
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,540
Can you please guide me to the police station?

545
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,910
Madam, what are you doing here so late at night?

546
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:16,910
This area isn't very safe.

547
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:26,910
What's the matter? Poor thing looked scared.

548
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:18,160
Who's there?

549
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,160
Open the door!

550
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,500
Hang on!

551
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:23,580
Please hurry up!

552
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,660
I'm coming.

553
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:32,660
If it's your drunk husband beating you again, I've told you I can't help with that.

554
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,200
Sir, I need help. My husband is injured.

555
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:38,950
What happened?

556
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:42,830
A group of people attacked us on the highway.

557
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:46,200
They stabbed him. He's bleeding very badly. Please come with me.

558
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:50,200
I'll call my boss.

559
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,290
It's ringing.

560
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:06,540
Yes, sir. There's a woman here, sir.

561
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,500
City type.

562
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,120
There's been some kind of incident, it seems.

563
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:14,250
Where have you come from?

564
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:15,080
Delhi.

565
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,750
Delhi.

566
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:22,370
No, Sir. She's from Delhi but the incident happened here...

567
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:25,750
...at the highway

568
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:29,040
Was it this side of the highway, or the other side?

569
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,290
Sir, please try and understand.

570
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:36,290
My husband and I were coming from Delhi. Some people attacked us on the highway.

571
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:40,830
My husband got stabbed...

572
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,830
I don't know. It's probably a case of honour killing.

573
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:48,120
They picked up a couple at a restaurant, killed them in front of us.

574
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,370
Why did you cut the call?

575
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:53,160
Go to the Basantpura police station.

576
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:54,000
But why?

577
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,700
This case concerns them, not us.

578
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:03,660
Sir, please try and understand. My husband is very badly hurt.

579
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,040
Please leave, madam. Go on...

580
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:07,250
Here, take this watch.

581
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,250
It's very expensive. At least two hundred thousand.

582
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:12,540
Madam, get out.

583
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,540
How can you do this? It's your duty to help us.

584
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,540
To hell with the duty. Just get out!

585
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,500
Go!

586
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,910
Go!

587
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:34,910
Get the hell out!

588
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,660
Was it you on the phone, madam?

589
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,410
Yes.

590
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:43,580
Yes, madam is with me.

591
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,870
We're driving down the back road now.

592
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:53,540
Stop arguing, Dhulichand. Just get to the railway tracks.

593
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:54,620
The forest side.

594
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:56,120
Yes.

595
01:05:56,620 --> 01:06:00,120
Okay.

596
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,750
He means well, this Dhulichand. Please don't lodge a complaint.

597
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,450
He's a policeman. He should have helped.

598
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:16,540
Policemen aren't beyond all this. They're part of the same society.

599
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,450
He would be ostracized if they found out.

600
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:23,330
He has three sons. Who would give them brides?

601
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:27,330
There are hardly any girls here in the first place.

602
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:36,910
Never mind. Tell me, what's your caste?

603
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,290
Caste...

604
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:45,290
Err... Singh... Puri after marriage.

605
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:49,080
Inter-caste marriage...

606
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:53,500
Singh and Puri are surnames, madam.

607
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,700
I meant caste. Like...

608
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,750
Brahmin... Bania... Jat... Gujjar...

609
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,540
I don't know.

610
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,700
In that case, I doubt you'd know your 'gotra' (sub-caste).

611
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,950
That's the difference, madam.

612
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:11,500
Ask a 12-year old boy in the village.

613
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:19,370
He'll not only tell you his gotra, but also his neighbours.

614
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:23,950
You must have read Manu? He was a very learned man.

615
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:28,540
Just like Ambedkar, who framed India's Constitution.

616
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:34,080
Ambedkar's law says that all cars must drive on the left.

617
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:36,080
So that's what they all do.

618
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:40,410
If even one amongst them starts to drive on the right, there will be an accident.

619
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:43,000
Now take this couple's case, this Mukesh and Pinky.

620
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:44,370
They knew all the laws around here.

621
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:49,540
Still, they got married within the same gotra. Now isn't that wrong?

622
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,370
It's probably shocking for you, but...

623
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:56,250
...right where the last mall in the city ends?

624
01:07:56,750 --> 01:08:00,830
That's where your rule of democracy and constitution ends as well.

625
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:05,830
How can the poor constitution reach where even water and electricity cannot?

626
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:12,870
Thank the caste system, madam. It keeps people divided.

627
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:17,540
Otherwise, we'd have a revolution here.

628
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:22,160
Which way from here?

629
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:26,160
I think we've come the wrong way.

630
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:35,870
Everything looks the same in the dark. I must have gotten confused...

631
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:56,450
No madam, I'm the one who messed up.

632
01:08:56,950 --> 01:09:00,450
You never told me the couple's name, did you?

633
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:09,410
You should have listened to Dhulichand.

634
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,410
She'll get away!

635
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:31,700
Come on, come on, come on!

636
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,700
Quick, quick!

637
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:21,580
Give me a hand. Quick!

638
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:22,750
What happened?

639
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:26,750
Get out and start pushing!

640
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:03,660
It's done, it's done!

641
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:07,540
Come on, get in!

642
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:11,540
Come on.

643
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:22,120
The car flipped over.

644
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:23,290
Look around!

645
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:27,290
She must be here somewhere.

646
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:29,330
She must have gone in that direction. Go, check!

647
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:33,330
Is she there? - No.

648
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,580
What a bunch of losers. Can't find a freaking girl.

649
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,040
Did you find her? - No.

650
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:48,790
She can't have gone too far.

651
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:52,790
She must have gone that way.

652
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:58,500
Move fast!

653
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,330
Let's look on that side.

654
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:01,580
Come quick!

655
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,700
Strutting about like freaking studs...

656
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,120
Start the car quick!

657
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:09,370
Hey, Satbir!

658
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:11,870
Come quick! There she is, hanging up there!

659
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:17,500
There she is! Get her!

660
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,040
Get her!

661
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:24,040
Where do you think you're going?

662
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,120
She's climbed up already!

663
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:44,120
She's gone!

664
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,540
F*** you!

665
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:01,200
You b****!

666
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,000
Go die, you b******!

667
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,750
S**** you, b****!

668
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,290
Hit her, hit her!

669
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:13,500
Bloody morons!

670
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,500
Get lost, you b******.

671
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:31,540
Hey! Wait for me, you fools!

672
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:35,540
Freaking morons! Forgot about their own uncle in all the hurry.

673
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:45,750
The damn network is also not catching.

674
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:54,910
Listen...! Someone's at the door...

675
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:58,000
Who's there?

676
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:02,000
Who is it?

677
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:09,660
Please help me. There are some men after me.

678
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:14,410
My husband is hurt. I've been running all night.

679
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:18,500
There's a police station nearby. Why don't you go there?

680
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,700
The police are in it too.

681
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:26,080
There's a village close by. Go to the Chief there.

682
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:27,290
Yes.

683
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:31,450
Will you come with me?

684
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:35,450
Madam, we too are outsiders here.

685
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:42,910
Who's there?

686
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:46,540
Open up!

687
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:47,370
What's the matter?

688
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:49,540
Open the door!

689
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:50,700
What do you want?

690
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,290
Open this door!

691
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:55,870
Who's there?

692
01:17:56,370 --> 01:18:00,870
Seems you've grown a pair, Bihari. Asking too many questions, huh?

693
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:04,870
Go, get me some water.

694
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:27,290
Forgive me, master. I wasn't feeling well.

695
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:32,870
The medicine made me sleepy, so took a while to get to the door.

696
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:37,660
You saw any woman around here?

697
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,660
No...

698
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,540
...who was it?

699
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,540
Running about like headless chickens.

700
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,910
What if I hadn't called you?

701
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:04,950
We went to the highway. Couldn't find her.

702
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:08,950
Calm down, idiots. Her husband's at the railway track. Let's just go there.

703
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:07,580
Anybody home?

704
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:12,750
Please open the door!

705
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:16,750
Anybody home?

706
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,620
Savitri sets off, and reaches her home.

707
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:51,790
She tells her father, "I have found myself a husband."

708
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:55,790
He celebrates with singing and dancing in the court.

709
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:59,790
And this is how Savitri's tale goes...

710
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:35,700
Don't be scared. Come here.

711
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:40,910
Can you take me to the Village Chief's house, please?

712
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:45,200
It's his house. If he goes, they won't let him come back.

713
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,790
It's your house? You're the Chief's...?

714
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:49,410
Grandson.

715
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:51,660
Please take me to your house.

716
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,540
Come on, Kamlesh. The clown's here.

717
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,750
Wait a minute. Listen to me...

718
01:21:56,250 --> 01:22:00,080
Savitri's name has made the old man stand up!

719
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:04,450
Sit down, grandpa. There aren't enough Savitris to go around.

720
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:08,080
And so many men competing for them.

721
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:12,830
Please, kid. Please tell me where your house is.

722
01:22:13,330 --> 01:22:16,830
Please, kid.

723
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:23,540
You want this watch?

724
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:37,160
Doesn't this blink?

725
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:38,870
Even my damned shoes do.

726
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:42,870
Here, take this.

727
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,580
Pack it all in the suitcase and put it away.

728
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,500
She was obsessed about going to college?

729
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:51,580
Ammaji...

730
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:55,580
Ammaji...Someone's at the door.

731
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:04,450
Go and find my hearing aid!

732
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:23,620
Boy! Didn't I tell you to stay here? Come on, get inside.

733
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,660
You've got a visitor.

734
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,660
She said she has some work with you.

735
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:38,080
Chief?

736
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:40,080
Yes, tell me?

737
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:42,080
You're the Chief?

738
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:46,080
Yes, what is it?

739
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:54,580
My husband... Please...

740
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:58,620
What happened, child?

741
01:24:59,120 --> 01:24:59,660
Manju!

742
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:03,790
I found it, Ammaji. Coming!

743
01:25:04,290 --> 01:25:07,410
Come quick. Something's wrong with this girl.

744
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:11,080
Stand up, child.

745
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:12,750
Hold her up.

746
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:17,080
What happened, child?

747
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:21,000
My husband...

748
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,450
He's lying there...

749
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:27,450
Careful. Take it easy.

750
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:44,540
She's terrified.

751
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,540
Get some water, kid.

752
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:50,540
Is aunty going somewhere?

753
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,200
Give me that.

754
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:03,870
Girl, are you all right?

755
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:05,000
What's the matter?

756
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:09,700
Aunty, please help.

757
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:14,750
We were on our way from Delhi. Someone attacked us on the way.

758
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:18,790
They kidnapped a girl and a boy from a restaurant.

759
01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:22,790
The girl asked me to help. Her name was Pinky...

760
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:34,580
They killed them both.

761
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:38,500
Where's my machine?

762
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,750
Get my hearing aid!

763
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:42,160
I didn't find it.

764
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:46,160
W****! Can't do one thing right!

765
01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:04,700
Aunty, please...

766
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,450
My husband is badly injured.

767
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:10,370
Someone attacked us on the way.

768
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:14,830
They kidnapped a girl and a boy from a restaurant.

769
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:17,750
Aunty, please come with me.

770
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:21,450
Please?

771
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:25,450
Aunty, please?

772
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:34,700
What happened here?

773
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:52,540
S***!

774
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:35,040
I haven't managed to get out in eight years, myself.

775
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:42,580
Pinky used to say, "I'll take you with me after I get married."

776
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:46,580
She was the only one here for me.

777
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,790
Why couldn't I get through to your phone?

778
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:24,540
I'd left it in the car.

779
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:28,450
And what if she had gotten away?

780
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:32,250
It's all under control, Ma.

781
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:35,790
There were six of you who went, and I only see four here.

782
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:39,790
That's your control?

783
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:47,540
Somebody shut her up!

784
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:04,330
You stay with aunt.

785
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:27,700
What're you looking at? Look down.

786
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:30,450
Look down!

787
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:34,450
Look down!

788
01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:16,370
Your wife.

789
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:20,370
Go, get her out here, too.

790
01:31:30,580 --> 01:31:34,080
You made a spectacle out of our private matter!

791
01:31:44,120 --> 01:31:47,620
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

792
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:49,580
Leave the boy!

793
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:54,950
Get back, or I'll throw him in.

794
01:31:55,450 --> 01:31:58,950
Don't you dare move ahead, or I'll throw him in.

795
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,790
Tell him to give the car keys.

796
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:08,450
The keys! Give them to me.

797
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:12,450
Quick!

798
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:18,370
Tell everyone to go inside.

799
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:20,540
Go inside, or I'll drop him.

800
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,040
Leave the kid alone!

801
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:26,040
Go inside!

802
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:32,580
Come on. Let's go.

803
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:36,580
Quick!

804
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,500
Not you. You bolt that door.

805
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:51,120
And move away from the door.

806
01:32:51,620 --> 01:32:55,120
Don't waste your time. Get out of here. Now!

807
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:18,250
Arjun!!

808
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:39,700
BLOODY W****.

809
01:36:20,290 --> 01:36:20,700
Open it.

810
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,250
Open it, b****.

811
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:25,000
Open the damned door!

812
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:31,540
Seems like you've forgotten your place around here!

813
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,750
I'll take care of her. You go get that one!

814
01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:38,950
Aunt's right. We can't let her escape. Come with me, Ramotar.

815
01:36:39,450 --> 01:36:44,370
Shut up, b****.

816
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:50,870
Run and get it. Quickly!

817
01:36:51,370 --> 01:36:53,540
Uncle, get Girdhari's Motorcycle. Quick!

818
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:56,160
Girdhari's motorcycle!

819
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:57,290
Be quick!

820
01:36:57,790 --> 01:37:01,290
All right, I'm going!

821
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:31,040
Come fast!

822
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:34,330
We'll take the back road, Okay? - Okay.

823
01:37:34,830 --> 01:37:38,330
Get going, quick!

824
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:16,540
Omi... Where the hell are you?

825
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:06,580
Uncle!

826
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:10,580
Uncle!

827
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:29,250
Satbir!

828
01:46:16,910 --> 01:46:21,790
She was my daughter.

829
01:46:22,290 --> 01:46:25,790
But sometimes, you just got to do it.

830
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:37,660
Yeah, sometimes you just got to do it.
