1
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,140
You want me to repeat the question?

2
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,898
You have any idea who the father might be?

3
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,361
- No.
- No.

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,406
Are you aware of any other
intimate relationships

5
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,573
that Carolyn may have been in?

6
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:43,085
Would you be willing to
submit to a paternity test?

7
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,294
Are you enjoying this, Tommy?

8
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,673
I am-- No. I'm not.
She was a friend and a colleague.

9
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,010
Your response?

10
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,139
Am I a suspect?

11
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,642
I just got the case.

12
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:04,815
God.

13
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,485
How long had you been fucking Carolyn?

14
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,549
- Are you kidding me?
- We had a personal relationship, okay?

15
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,843
And this was something you
didn't think you needed to tell me?

16
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,636
No, it was a personal matter.

17
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,347
I just lost an election-- my career--

18
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,100
- in part due to your personal matter.
- Okay. No. No.

19
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,227
That is not true.

20
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,604
- Bullshit!
- No.

21
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,815
This investigation
was the nail in my coffin

22
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,901
- and I put you in charge of it.
- No. No.

23
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:52,237
Look, you asked me to do it.
You imposed it on me. I did not want to.

24
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,032
It didn't occasion you
to think to yourself,

25
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,201
"Hold on.
Maybe I have a conflict of interest here.

26
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,578
- Yes, of course it did.
- I am having sex with the victim"?

27
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,914
Raymond, of course it did.

28
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,086
- She was pregnant with your child?
- Okay, I can't.

29
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,795
I just, pl-- Come on.

30
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,344
Rusty.

31
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,262
Hey, Rusty.

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,181
Rusty.

33
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,434
Listen, it would be good if
you could do that paternity test.

34
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,603
Remove your hand.

35
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:25,687
All right.

36
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,939
Get a warrant.

37
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,149
All right.

38
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,277
Yeah.

39
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,249
Hi.

40
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,210
- Hey, B.
- Hey.

41
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,879
Where are the kids?

42
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,216
They're upstairs.
They're doing their homework.

43
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,301
- They eaten?
- Not yet.

44
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,636
Can you sit down?

45
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,138
Yeah, sure.

46
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,019
I was just informed that...

47
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:38,487
Carolyn was pregnant
and they think that it was mine,

48
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,865
and I'm a suspect in her murder.

49
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,453
But it ended a year ago.

50
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:47,955
It did.

51
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,963
But it started back up again

52
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:02,135
just... briefly,

53
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,681
for not even-- less than a week.

54
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:13,438
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,326
You didn't even suspect anything?

56
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,161
Of course not.

57
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,664
You think I would have allowed for that?

58
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,750
- You might have pretended not to see.
- Well, I didn't.

59
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,420
I need to call Barbara.

60
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,005
What? Why?

61
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,298
Because she's my friend.

62
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:43,051
She's gonna wonder-- maybe assume--
that you knew about the affair,

63
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:47,681
which means she'll wonder if I knew
and I need to assure her that I did not.

64
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,727
You know, I think you should wait a minute

65
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,479
until Rusty has a conversation
with her first.

66
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,607
How long had this been going on?

67
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,276
I just found out about it myself, Lo.

68
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,361
That doesn't answer the question.

69
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,071
Well, I don't have an answer.

70
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,616
Why are you attacking me?

71
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:09,620
Because people sense things
about their friends, their colleagues.

72
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,332
You have a very good nose
and this happened right under it,

73
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,918
which means that is a reflection on you,

74
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:21,340
which makes it a reflection on me,
which gives me the right to be pissed off.

75
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,181
Poor Barbara. My God.

76
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,271
It's easy and quick.

77
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,398
- Five minutes.
- Five minutes?

78
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,525
That's plenty of time.

79
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,528
- What are we doing?
- So you're gonna come up and out.

80
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,904
- Up and out.
- Yeah.

81
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,405
Then up...

82
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,907
- Up.
- Then out.

83
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,742
- Okay.
- Other way.

84
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,411
- Why is it-- Okay.
- You're not--

85
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,539
We're going the same way,
so then it's...

86
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:54,623
But if we're going--

87
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,542
What?

88
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,777
Motherfucker.

89
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,543
Bunny Davis murder.

90
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,461
What about it?

91
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,923
There was a second spermatozoa sample
in the victim besides Liam Reynolds?

92
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,424
Yeah, inconclusive.

93
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,093
Yeah, but that wasn't in
the evidence doc that we--

94
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,887
that we handed over to the defense.

95
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:33,679
Not my problem.

96
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,557
No, but it is your problem,
because it's potentially

97
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,726
- prosecutorial misconduct if we didn't--
- Hold on.

98
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,436
It was an older sample on a different day.

99
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,855
No, but that doesn't matter.
It was potentially exculpatory.

100
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,441
<i>Carolyn had all this information, Sabich.</i>

101
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,526
<i>But I didn't!</i>

102
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,194
<i>Well, then maybe you should
read the freaking report.</i>

103
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,445
<i>I don't know what to tell you.</i>

104
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:58,372
There were two different spermatozoa
samples at the scene of the crime.

105
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,957
And again, Carolyn knew all this.

106
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,458
<i>What did you tell her?</i>

107
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,504
<i>That the only sample
we could identify was Reynolds.</i>

108
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,049
The other semen was inconclusive.
It was contaminated.

109
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,259
Was it yours?

110
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,054
We concealed evidence! We--

111
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,223
I didn't conceal anything.

112
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,812
It's all in my goddamn report,
and you need some serious fucking help.

113
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,962
Goddamn it. Fucking pick up.

114
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,299
<i>You've reached Detective Rodriguez.
Please leave a message.</i>

115
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,633
Rigo, it's me.

116
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:54,094
Can you call me back?
It's very important, okay?

117
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,262
Just call me back.

118
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,146
Fuck.

119
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,441
You're saying he physically assaulted him?

120
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:11,445
He grabbed the guy by his fucking throat.
He was, like, fucking doing this.

121
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,947
He's sick.
You know what I'm talking about.

122
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,157
He's fucking sick.

123
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,658
Yeah. Tommy, take a seat.

124
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,327
I don't need to sit down.

125
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,997
Listen, this guy...

126
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,958
Just take a moment.

127
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,002
I'm fine.

128
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:34,426
As delicious as the prospect is

129
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,346
that Rusty may be culpable...

130
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,640
Yeah.

131
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,975
I just want you just to follow the facts.

132
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,770
- I got you. I know what you're saying.
- Right?

133
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:48,815
'Cause our job is not to get Rusty Sabich.

134
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,735
Our job is to get it right.

135
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,406
I'm a professional.
I understand what you're saying.

136
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:02,079
So, just let the evidence be your guide,

137
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,415
not your fucking feelings.

138
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,003
<i>You've reached Detective Rodriguez.
Please leave a message.</i>

139
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,637
Hey.

140
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,182
Hey, Dad.

141
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,489
- Hi. What you eating?
- Hey.

142
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,699
- Chinese.
- Chinese.

143
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,826
- Hey.
- How was work today, Dad?

144
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,580
It sucked.

145
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,707
You guys want a napkin?

146
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,462
What happened?

147
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,009
A lot.

148
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,979
Guys, phones down please.

149
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,066
Phones down.

150
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,532
So something has happened.

151
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,330
And before you hear it from others,

152
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,415
I would like you to hear it from...

153
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,293
us.

154
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:18,465
So your father has something
he would like to...

155
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:21,510
tell you.

156
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,642
I don't think that now
is the time or the place.

157
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,978
Is there a better fucking time or place?

158
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:34,815
You want them to hear it
on the news? School?

159
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:36,942
What's going on?

160
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,492
Carolyn Polhemus and I
were having an affair.

161
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,165
It wasn't going on for very long,

162
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,961
but the detectives in the investigation,

163
00:13:56,712 --> 00:14:02,050
you know, have a lot of questions
about it-- about that.

164
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:05,262
And I think that your mother is right.

165
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,390
I think it's better
that you hear it from me

166
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,184
than see it on the news

167
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,897
or hear about it
from one of your friends at school, so...

168
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:21,695
I want you to know that I'm sorry

169
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,906
and that I love you.

170
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,498
Kyle.

171
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,638
I will not be alone with this this time.

172
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,497
I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry.

173
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:15,207
It's all right. It's a shock.

174
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,251
I know.

175
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,795
Now, listen, real life has come early

176
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:24,216
and we are in
for some difficult days, okay?

177
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:28,011
But we will get through this.

178
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,472
Are you gonna leave him?

179
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:35,727
I don't know yet.

180
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,981
Your father is a good man...

181
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,151
and I think he loved her.

182
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,782
And that is very difficult for me.

183
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,042
<i>I...</i>

184
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,923
I just don't want anyone to get hurt.

185
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,218
Me or you, or...

186
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:12,806
I just think...

187
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,351
we're at that point.

188
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,188
I can't do this anymore.

189
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:22,900
Don't you agree?

190
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,468
<i>"Just a simple guy," you said.</i>

191
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:53,388
<i>"Still wet behind the ears."
A lot of junk about American ideals.</i>

192
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,184
<i>Yeah, this is certainly a lot of junk,
all right.</i>

193
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,810
<i>Now, look, Senator...</i>

194
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,689
<i>I don't know.
This is a whole new world to me.</i>

195
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,026
Hey.

196
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,112
- Hey.
- You okay?

197
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,837
Do you love Mom?

198
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,217
So much.

199
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:33,595
Then why?

200
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,284
Kyle?

201
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,751
Hey, it's not even 06:00 in the morning.

202
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:46,835
Come on.

203
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,214
Come on. You're making a lot of noise.

204
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,675
I couldn't sleep.

205
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,762
Kyle. Kyle.

206
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,682
Just come inside. Come on.

207
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:04,436
- I'll make you some pancakes.
- I don't want any fucking pancakes, Dad.

208
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,423
Claude, what are you doing?

209
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,009
Sorry, Rusty. Search warrant.

210
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,222
My wife and daughter are inside.

211
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,224
Well, they're gonna get woken.

212
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,518
I'll give you the honors,
but we gotta go in.

213
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:46,937
Come on. Let's go.

214
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,304
Why are they taking my computer?

215
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:23,390
- Honey, they have to take everything.
- Dad, it's mine.

216
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:36,570
Rusty.

217
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,200
- What's going on?
- This one's for...

218
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:43,744
It's the other.

219
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:50,125
We could bring you to the lab,
but it'd be easier here.

220
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:40,509
Tommy, just a minute.

221
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,894
- You come to my house at dawn?
- Hey, don't do this.

222
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,646
In front of my family.

223
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:53,939
My children.

224
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:57,067
We typically serve warrants at dawn,
as was your preference.

225
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,862
In fact, you had files from this office
which didn't--

226
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:02,781
- They were cases I was working on.
- You're not working on anything anymore.

227
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:04,575
As of this moment,
you're on administrative leave.

228
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:05,951
You think I don't understand
what you're doing?

229
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,203
- Get your face out of mine.
- How's it going, buddy? You all right?

230
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:11,498
- Come on. Why don't we do this--
- Don't even try and do shit like that.

231
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,916
- You're out of control.
- I am not.

232
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,085
Medical examiners.
You're threatening district attorneys.

233
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,254
You're threatening me.
I'm not threatening you.

234
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,798
You are, with words and tone,
and body language.

235
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,049
You are.

236
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:25,470
You really think that I killed Carolyn?
Really?

237
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,681
- Look, that is not for me to say.
- Really?

238
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:30,100
What I can say is that
you willfully misdirected

239
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,935
- and you impeded this investigation.
- Oh, my God.

240
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,729
- That is not a good look for this office.
- Okay.

241
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:35,981
- All right. Yeah.
- It's not a good look for you.

242
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,149
Fuck.

243
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:47,868
<i>You lied to your therapist.</i>

244
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:50,037
<i>I thought you said
this wasn't gonna be about blame.</i>

245
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:55,042
We had a session alone and you--
You deceived me point blank.

246
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,627
I am not a liar.

247
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:58,170
Well, you are. Of course you are.

248
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,132
It is the lie of omission.

249
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,717
- You told me--
- No, I lied about that.

250
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,511
You told me that the affair had ended.

251
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:07,095
I lied about that
and I lied about Carolyn.

252
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,222
I lied about the affair,

253
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,683
but, like, only that.

254
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,271
- Well, the good news is--
- I'm not a liar.

255
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:20,067
The good news is that Barbara is--
she's here.

256
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:22,694
A lot of people wouldn't be.

257
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:24,738
So what are we doing?

258
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,741
What's the goal?

259
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:31,370
Barbara?

260
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,456
I don't know.

261
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:38,085
I guess I feel trapped.

262
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,461
By?

263
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,673
We have kids.

264
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:44,508
Rusty, you want to salvage this marriage?

265
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,176
Yes. Yes, I want to salvage it.

266
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,387
And not just because we have kids.

267
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:49,721
I love you.

268
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,682
I know that that sounds hollow right now.

269
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,059
If you're arrested--

270
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,686
No, the--

271
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:58,897
There's not an "if."

272
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:01,942
I will be arrested.

273
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:06,321
I mean, they're going through
my phone and my computer right now

274
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,950
and they're gonna see
that I was obsessed with her.

275
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:14,079
I mean,
I was basically stalking her, you know?

276
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,247
I mean...

277
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,960
the breakup wasn't good.

278
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:26,133
If I was a prosecutor,
I wouldn't fucking hesitate.

279
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:30,220
And it's being Tommy Molto,
there's no "if."

280
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:34,141
When will the DA name a suspect?

281
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,894
No, we're not prepared
to name a suspect at this time,

282
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:38,854
but we're confident
that one will be forthcoming.

283
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:43,025
<i>I ran for this office on
a promise of vigilance.</i>

284
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:45,652
<i>It's a vow that I intend to keep.</i>

285
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:48,655
<i>Gone are the days when
the district attorney</i>

286
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,617
<i>sees crimes against women
and simply shrugs.</i>

287
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:55,412
<i>Carolyn Polhemus's killer will be found.</i>

288
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:57,789
<i>And that killer will be held accountable.</i>

289
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,041
Enough of that.

290
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:15,641
Is Raymond here?

291
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:22,940
Yeah.

292
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:27,569
They raided the house.

293
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:30,739
They took my phone
and my computer, Barbara's, the kids'.

294
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,991
Yeah. Well, what do you expect, Rusty?

295
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,993
I mean, you did it
a thousand times yourself

296
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:36,995
to a thousand different people, right?

297
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:39,373
It's the drill. Now you know how it feels.

298
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:41,291
They're gonna charge me.

299
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:43,752
You know this for sure?

300
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,504
Yes. They're going to go through
the computer

301
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:48,090
and see that there were a lot of emails
to her in that last week.

302
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,675
They're going to go
through the cell phone.

303
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:51,218
See there were a lot of calls and texts.

304
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:52,970
They're going to say
that I was stalking her.

305
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,013
And you add that to
the prints at the scene.

306
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:56,974
They don't have evidence
leading to anyone else.

307
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:59,434
And Tommy Molto is
certainly not going to go looking.

308
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,520
You better get yourself an attorney.

309
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:05,732
That's why I'm here.

310
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:07,818
Oh, no.

311
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:12,489
No.

312
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:17,077
I need somebody
who is versed in Delay and Molto.

313
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:20,914
You need someone who is versed in defense.

314
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,625
No, I need someone who can
get into their heads, Raymond.

315
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:25,878
You are the best lawyer that I know.

316
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:27,838
And I need you.

317
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:32,634
Do you have an ounce of fucking humility?

318
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,845
The gall it takes for you to
come into my house...

319
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:37,472
- I should've told you. Listen to me.
- ...look Lorraine in the face--

320
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,141
Listen to me.

321
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:40,058
It--

322
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:42,269
It was wrong of me.

323
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,813
But you know what?
It's a fucking surprise.

324
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:47,149
I did it because I wanted you to win.

325
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:48,483
It wasn't the right thing to do.

326
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:52,654
But do you really think that I killed her?
Do you? You know me.

327
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,489
I thought I did.

328
00:26:58,952 --> 00:26:59,912
Fuck!

329
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:01,997
Fuck!

330
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:05,542
Come on.

331
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:07,586
Where the fuck have you been?

332
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,007
Pick up.

333
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:21,350
Hey.

334
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,268
Where have you been?
I've been trying to call all day.

335
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:24,353
<i>Fuck you, Rusty.</i>

336
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:26,647
Listen, I need your help.

337
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:28,732
Please.

338
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,776
Listen, I need you to get me
in to see Reynolds again.

339
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:32,986
Look, they've taken me off the case.
There's nothing I can do.

340
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,280
No, no. Listen.
Just please, please listen.

341
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,074
Rigo, I need you, okay?

342
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:40,077
There was a second sperm sample
and I know that Reynolds knows something.

343
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:42,621
I need to get back in to see him
and you can get me in. Just please.

344
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,658
Why are we meeting here?

345
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,080
I have--

346
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:27,666
I don't have security clearance today.

347
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:32,379
So you're just a regular visitor?
No more "officer of the court."

348
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:36,425
This is perverse.

349
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:40,596
I know you know something.

350
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:43,807
Are you a suspect?

351
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:50,147
I'm here, Liam, because if you
have any information

352
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:51,857
that leads us to the real killer,

353
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:53,942
you might shave some time
off your sentence.

354
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,201
You like perversity?

355
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:09,875
Even if you had Carolyn killed,
it could work in your favor.

356
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:13,837
You'd have to have an accomplice
which means you'd have something to trade.

357
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:16,215
Right now, you're serving
a life sentence for killing Bunny Davis.

358
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:18,050
By pointing us to Carolyn,

359
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:20,511
you could possibly see
the street again, you know?

360
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:23,096
Even if you had a hand in the murder too.

361
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:25,933
Now that is perversity.

362
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:31,647
Okay, so, just to be clear,
you're telling me incriminating myself...

363
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:33,398
- If you had an accomplice.
- ...in a prosecutor's murder,

364
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:35,400
- could lead me to my freedom?
- Yes.

365
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:41,031
What's certain is that you are currently
serving a life sentence without parole.

366
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:43,909
And I am offering you an
opportunity to change that.

367
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:47,329
Oh, God.

368
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:53,418
This is beautiful.

369
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,133
You're desperate.

370
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:10,769
So, nothing then?

371
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:11,979
Not yet.

372
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:15,232
- Not yet.
- Well, he's a sick guy, you know?

373
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:20,320
I mean,
he had it out for her, he threatened her.

374
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:23,115
She was killed
the same way Bunny Davis was.

375
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:24,408
Bunny was stabbed.

376
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:26,618
And tied up like Carolyn.

377
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:29,872
I don't know how many times
I have to say this.

378
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:41,341
I just need to get to the truth.

379
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:42,843
I'm just-- I--

380
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:44,636
I mean-- And--

381
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:48,932
I mean, short of that, I just--
Just some fucking reasonable doubt.

382
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:50,601
You could have told me, you know?

383
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:58,400
That I was sleeping with her.

384
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,695
If for no other reason than
to save me some fucking time.

385
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,739
I didn't kill her.

386
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:05,699
I mean, I--

387
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,327
I can't even-- Like--

388
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:13,165
You know, the police certainly
aren't going to be looking for who did.

389
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:14,791
I mean, at least not many of them.

390
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,088
So I need you.

391
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:29,890
No more fucking lying to me.

392
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:35,646
Yeah?

393
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:49,493
- <i>I didn't say yes.</i>
- <i>You didn't say yes.</i>

394
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:52,162
- I did not say yes.
- You didn't say no.

395
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,623
You cherished Carolyn.

396
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:56,792
- It's not about Carolyn.
- Yes, it is.

397
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:58,377
She's the one who was murdered.

398
00:31:58,377 --> 00:31:59,336
Look...

399
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:03,423
if I thought for a second
that Rusty was responsible--

400
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:05,342
You did think it for a second.
You told me.

401
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:07,511
- Rusty couldn't have done this.
- Bullshit.

402
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,221
Whether he did it or not--

403
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:11,431
He's my close friend.

404
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:13,225
Maybe my best friend.

405
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:17,312
I mean, it's not inconceivable
that I would want to help him.

406
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:18,772
This is how you retire?

407
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:22,150
Why can't we just travel
like we talked about?

408
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,444
You know, get a little place in Florida--

409
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:27,698
Does it have to be Florida?
Florida's for dead people. I'm--

410
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:29,116
I'm not dead.

411
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:31,869
I mean, sometimes I feel like it but...

412
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,247
That's what this is about.

413
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,082
Your not wanting to be dead.

414
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:39,334
Right now, my legacy...

415
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:43,672
I went out in defeat.

416
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:49,553
I was beaten by a conniving shithead
who's holding press conferences every day,

417
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:51,972
dancing on my political grave.

418
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:56,935
If I could avenge
those two tiny little suck fucks...

419
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:00,606
That would be meaningful.

420
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:08,906
And it's not a crime for me to want
to wake up every morning

421
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,490
to a life that has meaning.

422
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:14,244
I'm sorry you feel it doesn't right now.

423
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:17,539
This isn't about you.

424
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:19,666
You are my wife.

425
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,668
You mean everything to me. You know that.

426
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:25,130
Just not enough.

427
00:33:58,539 --> 00:33:59,540
Hey.

428
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:09,716
Jay...

429
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,054
will you look at me?

430
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,100
Where's your mom?

431
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:21,812
Out back, smoking by the tree house.

432
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:24,815
Not that I know that though.

433
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,581
Hello?

434
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:43,667
<i>Hey, we got the lab results back.</i>

435
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:46,795
<i>Paternity confirmed.</i>

436
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:51,341
<i>Sorry, Rusty.
I know it's not what you wanted to hear.</i>

437
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,284
What's that?

438
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:27,878
Jay, go get your mom.

439
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:29,588
Go get your mother.

440
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:31,465
- Okay.
- Jay?

441
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:33,300
Jaden,

442
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:35,719
I love you.

443
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:43,644
Mom!

444
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:59,826
Mr. Sabich,
we have a warrant for your arrest.

445
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:03,497
You have the right to remain silent.

446
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:06,959
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

447
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:10,003
Please turn around and put
your hands behind your back.

448
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:12,506
You have the right to an attorney.

449
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:15,008
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed--

450
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:16,635
Look, it's a sad day.

451
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:20,347
It's a very sad day when a member
of our law enforcement community,

452
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:25,853
who's entrusted to safeguard the public,
is accused of such a heinous crime.

453
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:30,023
<i>When a public servant so betrays his duty,</i>

454
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:33,068
<i>so violates his commitment to justice,</i>

455
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:35,112
<i>to humanity,</i>

456
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,699
<i>by taking another individual's life.</i>

457
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:42,369
<i>If there is any consolation,
we can all take heart</i>

458
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:46,373
<i>in one of our most cherished
jurisprudence ideals.</i>

459
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:49,376
{\an8}<i>Nobody is above the law.</i>

460
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:51,712
<i>Nobody.</i>

461
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:19,281
<i>The arrest of a former prosecutor
has sent shock waves,</i>

462
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:20,657
<i>not just here in Chicago.</i>

463
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:23,410
<i>This case is sure
to attract national attention.</i>

464
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:27,164
{\an8}Mr. Sabich was taken into custody
at his residence last night.

465
00:37:27,164 --> 00:37:30,083
The arrest was
evidently made without incident.

466
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,670
Mr. Sabich spent the night in detention,
in the building behind me

467
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,464
where he now awaits arraignment.

468
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:39,426
<i>Criminal case 861246.</i>

469
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:42,721
<i>The People of Illinois v. Rozat K. Sabich</i>.

470
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:44,681
The defendant is charged herein

471
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:47,100
that he did commit murder
in the first degree

472
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,188
and that he did knowingly, intentionally,
and with malice aforethought

473
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:55,234
trespass with force and arms
upon the person of Carolyn Polhemus,

474
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:57,778
thereby taking the life of
the aforementioned...

475
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,669
Your Honor, Thomas Molto,

476
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:16,171
Chief Deputy District Attorney
for the People of Illinois,

477
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:17,589
registering my appearance

478
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:20,968
as well as the appearance
of District Attorney, Nico Della Guardia.

479
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:22,886
Raymond Horgan for the defense, Judge.

480
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:25,556
Your Honor,
the defendant is present in court.

481
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:27,599
We would acknowledge
receipt of the indictment

482
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,227
and waive the remainder of formal reading.

483
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:32,020
On behalf of Mr. Sabich,

484
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:35,566
we would like the court to
enter a plea of not guilty to the charge.

485
00:38:35,566 --> 00:38:37,317
Plea of not guilty to the indictment.

486
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:40,070
Bail is set at 1.5 million signature bond.

487
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:43,073
Is there a request from either party
for a pretrial conference?

488
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:48,537
Your Honor, given the depravity
visited upon a beloved member

489
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,664
of our law enforcement community,

490
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:53,375
the People would ask
that a pretrial conference

491
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,335
be set at your earliest convenience.

492
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:57,838
That would be an unnecessary waste
of the court's time.

493
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:00,632
The charge in this case is entirely false.

494
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:03,427
The reputation of one of
the city's finest public servants

495
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:06,346
and attorneys has been impugned,
perhaps destroyed

496
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:08,223
without any basis in fact.

497
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:09,933
Justice in this case must be swift

498
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:15,689
and we therefore ask the court
to find an immediate trial date.

499
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:19,735
Be careful what you ask for, Counsel.

500
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:21,862
I have made my request.

501
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:24,531
The defendant has
waived pretrial conference.

502
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:26,450
The matter will be set
immediately for trial.

503
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,785
Defendant's motions
to be filed in 14 days,

504
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:31,330
and the prosecuting attorney
to respond seven days hence.

505
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,666
Now, Mr. Molto, Mr. Della Guardia,

506
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,461
this case is likely to inspire
many speeches

507
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:39,254
which you seem predisposed to give.

508
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:42,841
Mr. Horgan is correct when he observes
that these are very serious charges.

509
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:48,347
Against a lawyer who has served this court
with distinction for many years.

510
00:39:48,347 --> 00:39:50,474
Let us aim for justice to be done.

511
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:53,727
And it need not be
served with any extra pomp.

512
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:56,939
And that goes for you too, Mr. Horgan.

513
00:39:57,773 --> 00:39:59,483
I don't do pomp, Judge.

514
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:03,195
The defendant is remanded.

515
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:06,448
His bail will be processed.
This proceeding is adjourned.

516
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:14,373
- Thank you for--
- Yeah, goes without saying.

517
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:17,668
Don't talk to anybody in there.
And get something to eat, will you?

518
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:20,504
You gotta be kidding me.

519
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:22,214
I am definitely not kidding.

520
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:24,842
This is as serious as I get, Nico.

521
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:28,262
Maybe we should start with wiping
the smiles off our respective faces.

522
00:40:28,262 --> 00:40:30,180
Fuck-Thing One. Fuck-Thing Two.

523
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:42,609
It seems you got a good draw
with this judge.

524
00:40:44,903 --> 00:40:47,447
Yeah, she's an ex-defense lawyer and she--

525
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:50,033
she's fair, you know?

526
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:56,290
I just wanted to say I know that...

527
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:02,754
today must have been really hard
for you all.

528
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,926
I wanna say thank you for being there.

529
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:11,263
Is it good that it's happening fast?

530
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:12,431
Yeah.

531
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,435
Time favors the prosecution.
So the faster, the better.

532
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:18,020
For all of us.
