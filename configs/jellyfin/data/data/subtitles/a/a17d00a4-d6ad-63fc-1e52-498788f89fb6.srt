1
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:52,326
That's the sleeping kid over there.

2
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:55,846
OK. Give it the works.
It looks like the kid was homeless.

3
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:59,446
Really? I thought he might've been
vacationing here with his parents.

4
00:00:59,606 --> 00:01:02,566
Boss, this is Mr Shrimpton.

5
00:01:02,726 --> 00:01:05,446
Stabbed from behind.

6
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:08,246
G'day, Serge. Shrimpo.
Detective Maraco. I wouldn't.

7
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:12,406
Jesus, Mother of Mary,
hey? God help us all.

8
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:14,806
Are you from Catholic stock,
Mr Shrimpton?

9
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:16,966
Mr Shrimpo says he saw
the whole thing.

10
00:01:17,126 --> 00:01:18,766
Saw it from go to whoa.

11
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:20,766
You didn't think to help?

12
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:23,806
I was standing over there.
I called you lot, didn't 1?

13
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:25,326
We've met before, haven't we?

14
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,286
I dunno. I get about.

15
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:29,046
I used to be with the drug squad.

16
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:31,206
Look, do you want my info or what?

17
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:33,246
I've got other things
I could be doing, you know.

18
00:01:33,406 --> 00:01:35,406
Sure. Why not?

19
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:37,406
What did you see?

20
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:39,366
Well, I seen him stab the boy.

21
00:01:39,526 --> 00:01:41,326
I seen him running out of the lane.

22
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:42,806
I've seen him holding the knife

23
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:45,606
and I've seen him dump the knife
in the big bin down in Macauley Street.

24
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:47,086
And who is he?

25
00:01:47,246 --> 00:01:48,766
Seen him about.
He calls himself ‘Pica'.

26
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:49,806
Pica?

27
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:53,446
That's a typeface.
Quite attractive.

28
00:01:55,886 --> 00:01:58,006
Constable, take Mr Shrimpton
to the station.

29
00:01:58,166 --> 00:02:01,406
So, you know,
do I get a finder's fee, or...

30
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:04,646
Yeah. 10 million bucks
and a holiday in the Bahamas.

31
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:06,886
Charming.

32
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:12,766
A beautiful face.

33
00:02:17,926 --> 00:02:21,126
That could work in the hall near
the bathroom. What do you think?

34
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:24,726
I think the cheese dip is good.

35
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:29,286
I want you to choose
something to put on the walls.

36
00:02:29,446 --> 00:02:31,366
I want you to make my place yours.

37
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:36,326
Fine. I will paint the walls
in cheese dip.

38
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:44,086
David Potter, man of the hour.

39
00:02:44,246 --> 00:02:45,606
Hello, Joe.
How are you?

40
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,126
Good. I don't believe you've met
my partner, Melissa.

41
00:02:48,286 --> 00:02:51,166
Joe Sandilands,
our esteemed Attorney-General.

42
00:02:51,326 --> 00:02:56,046
Ah, no. No, I haven't, but I'm much
richer for the experience.

43
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:57,526
How do you do?
Hi.

44
00:02:57,686 --> 00:03:01,286
How would you feel about seeing this
after you came out from the loo?

45
00:03:01,446 --> 00:03:03,046
David wants to buy it.

46
00:03:03,206 --> 00:03:06,566
Well, um...it depends what I'd eaten
the night before, I suppose.

47
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,886
Now, your name
keeps making an appearance

48
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:12,286
in the, uh, corridors of power.

49
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:13,766
Premier wants to meet you.

50
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:16,126
Wants to know which side of
the Labor fence you sit.

51
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:18,846
Oh, I'm not sure what side
she sits on.

52
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:20,806
What's it about?

53
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:26,086
Call. An interesting discourse
will transpire.

54
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:27,926
How you going?
Excuse me.

55
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:31,886
Melissa. We're, uh...
We're sweet, OK?

56
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,446
Yeah.
Good.

57
00:03:33,606 --> 00:03:36,886
Welcome one, welcome all.
May I have your attention, please?

58
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:40,286
Now, I say this not as
Flick Moyers, gallery owner,

59
00:03:40,446 --> 00:03:45,406
but as Flick Moyers, lifetime supporter
of emerging talent.

60
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:48,566
With this exhibition tonight,
with its exuberance, its live...

61
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:51,446
Good, mate.
I'll save you a return trip.

62
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,526
May I have your attention
for just a brief mo.

63
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:56,886
Oh. Flick!

64
00:03:57,046 --> 00:03:58,366
Oh. Hold on.

65
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:02,086
Did I just hear Flick
use the word ‘mo'?

66
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:03,606
Pretty sure Flick did.

67
00:04:03,766 --> 00:04:07,086
Melissa.
Cleaver.

68
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:12,326
Harry — sorry, David —
I never, uh...

69
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:15,046
Never pictured you as the arty type.

70
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:18,446
Always see you in a velvet cap
and a red cape

71
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:21,406
chasing foxes
on your father's estate.

72
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:23,726
My father worked in a bank.

73
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:27,246
Did he really?
The stories you must have!

74
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:28,766
..accompanied your invitations...

75
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:30,566
There were invitations?

76
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:34,726
Yes, but it's also about
helping a great cause.

77
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:40,446
50% of all commission tonight will go to
rebuilding the war-ravaged Congo.

78
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:43,446
Oh, well, that'll fix it!

79
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:46,446
I'm not suggesting that, and I would ask
you not to interrupt.

80
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:48,926
Well, just a cotton-pickin' mo here, Flick.

81
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:52,126
I'm poised to pull out a lazy 20 G

82
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:58,046
and purchase one of these live,
textural bilious attacks on art.

83
00:04:58,206 --> 00:05:00,486
I need to know how my donation

84
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:02,566
that you're now
describing as YOUR donation

85
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:06,206
is gonna relieve the suffering
of the good burghers of the Congo.

86
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:08,806
Cleaver, you're a terminable bore.
Please leave.

87
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:11,806
Robert Benchley said that,
“All art is relative,

88
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:14,926
“but all your relatives
are not necessarily art.”

89
00:05:15,086 --> 00:05:18,046
Oh, that's what I love about
a gallery opening, folks!

90
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:19,966
A better class of bouncer!

91
00:05:20,126 --> 00:05:22,246
Please! Don't hurt me, bwana!

92
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,966
Come on, folks, really...

93
00:05:24,126 --> 00:05:27,246
My apologies for that interruption.

94
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,366
Well, I think you handled that
with great dignity.

95
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:42,446
My trick is to
write it all down before.

96
00:05:42,606 --> 00:05:44,646
Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse.

97
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:49,446
Go home. Go to bed.

98
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:51,326
Without you.

99
00:05:51,486 --> 00:05:53,886
Without me.

100
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:58,766
You are so utterly beautiful.

101
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:01,006
It terrifies me.

102
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:42,766
Oh...sorry. Did I wake you?
Nah, it's OK.

103
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:46,606
I really tried. I lasted half an hour longer
than last night.

104
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:48,566
Shouldn't be this hard for you.

105
00:06:48,726 --> 00:06:51,966
It's not you. I always have trouble
sharing a bed after sex.

106
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:53,446
I get restless.

107
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:54,966
You want a chamomile tea?

108
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:58,846
No. I'm just gonna cycle some more and
then I'll come back to bed.

109
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:09,046
I've already...
Yes. I've already done it.

110
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:10,686
Is there anything else?

111
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:14,686
Um...

112
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:17,806
Which is when you found
exactly what, Constable?

113
00:07:17,966 --> 00:07:19,846
Close to half a kilo of cocaine.

114
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,486
Thank you, Constable.

115
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,686
Uh...

116
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:33,486
Your report says you found pornography
under my client's bed.

117
00:07:33,646 --> 00:07:35,326
Yes.

118
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:38,166
In fact, you made a pretty
comprehensive list

119
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:39,646
of his library.

120
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:45,366
Uh...‘Dick Tracing',
‘Under My Belly IIT',

121
00:07:45,526 --> 00:07:46,846
‘Clash of the Clits'.

122
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:50,886
All of this
while searching for cocaine.

123
00:07:51,046 --> 00:07:52,366
I was establishing
it wasn't kiddie porn.

124
00:07:52,526 --> 00:07:54,126
And was it?
No.

125
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:56,726
Constable, how long
would you say it took you

126
00:07:56,886 --> 00:07:59,166
to establish that
it wasn't kiddie porn?

127
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:03,446
A bit.

128
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:07,726
‘A bit'. So is that a minute? More?

129
00:08:07,886 --> 00:08:08,726
Your Honour...

130
00:08:08,886 --> 00:08:10,246
I'll allow it.

131
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,886
Five minutes? 10?

132
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:18,486
About...half an hour.

133
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:20,926
Oh.

134
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:26,126
So...in that highly awkward
and uncomfortable position

135
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:28,006
of being under someone else's bed —

136
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,926
a circumstance
I can sympathise with — um...

137
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:39,926
Constable, did you masturbate while you
were under my client's bed?

138
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,246
Your Honour!

139
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:46,166
We have a match and a name.

140
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:48,006
Denny Lorton calls himself ‘Pica'.

141
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,206
He has form.
Sexual assault 30 years ago.

142
00:08:50,366 --> 00:08:53,526
God, this being a detective is easy.

143
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:55,846
The dead boy is Benjamin Rigby.
15 years old.

144
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:57,686
He's been selling himself
for 18 months or so.

145
00:08:57,846 --> 00:08:59,206
Had he been reported missing?

146
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:03,606
Mum's a junkie.
That lane was his beat.

147
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:05,166
Is this Lorton?

148
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:07,246
Reckon they could
make this room any uglier?

149
00:09:08,806 --> 00:09:09,646
Probably not.

150
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:12,446
It's like they think no-one
actually has to work in here.

151
00:09:12,606 --> 00:09:14,526
Why do we settle for ugly
like it doesn't matter?

152
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:18,526
Bit of colour there, painting there.

153
00:09:18,686 --> 00:09:22,366
Some flowers.
I'm wasted in this profession.

154
00:09:24,566 --> 00:09:26,366
Pick this creep up, will you?

155
00:09:26,526 --> 00:09:28,966
Tommy!

156
00:09:38,046 --> 00:09:39,606
Strictly cash these days, Manos.

157
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:41,606
Since when?

158
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:44,646
Since I woke up
in a strange hotel room

159
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:48,686
with third-degree burns on my arse and
no idea how they got there.

160
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:52,806
I owe you big-time, mate.

161
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:55,006
If you change your mind,
give us a tinkle.

162
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:00,766
Red!

163
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:02,286
Good morning's work.

164
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:03,766
You humiliate a young cop

165
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:05,926
and keep that clump of sink hair
out of prison.

166
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:09,646
Oh, you Jews are so Old Testament.
I did my job.

167
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:11,206
How are things?

168
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:14,206
Barney and I are still under the same
roof, if that's what you mean.

169
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:18,046
He, uh... He does the dishes,
I sort the socks and ironing.

170
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:19,526
We don't talk.

171
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:21,446
Oh, so all back to normal.

172
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:23,566
As in, you mean,
are you off the hook?

173
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:26,006
No, I didn't mean that.

174
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,726
Just a sec.
Wendy rang.

175
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:30,046
Something about a meeting
with a John Bartrop

176
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:31,766
which, typically,
you didn't share with me.

177
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:34,646
I don't know any John Bar...
Who is John Bartrop?

178
00:10:34,806 --> 00:10:37,566
You were apparently due at
Fuzz's school an hour ago.

179
00:10:37,726 --> 00:10:39,246
Oh, shit. That John Bartrop.

180
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,806
Sorry, um... Red, can I...

181
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:44,246
Can we talk later?
Why?

182
00:10:47,486 --> 00:10:51,206
He's a beautiful student.
An absolute pleasure to teach.

183
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:53,246
You don't have to sugar-coat this
for me, you know.

184
00:10:53,406 --> 00:10:54,966
I mean every word of it.

185
00:10:55,126 --> 00:10:59,326
The other teachers'
comments have ranged from,

186
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:03,246
“Is everything alright at home?” to, “Have
doctors mentioned medication?”

187
00:11:03,406 --> 00:11:05,726
Well, Finnegan has issues.

188
00:11:05,886 --> 00:11:07,966
His attention span isn't enormous,

189
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,726
but he's so engaging and clever.

190
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,406
Wow. Well, he does like your classes.

191
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:15,406
English is the only subject
he seems to study.

192
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:18,126
He expresses himself beautifully.

193
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:20,966
So I don't have to send him
down the mines quite yet?

194
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:24,326
Uh, I'm sorry. I think that might be
my next appointment.

195
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:27,366
No, that is your previous one.

196
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:29,366
That's Fuzz's dad who's
just successfully missed

197
00:11:29,526 --> 00:11:31,126
every other parent-teacher interview.

198
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:34,646
Cleaver, this is Fiona McReady —
Fuzz's English teacher.

199
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:35,646
Hi.

200
00:11:35,806 --> 00:11:39,046
Sorry.
Caught up in a very complex trial.

201
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:42,806
Oh, was the complex trial run
over five or eight furlongs?

202
00:11:42,966 --> 00:11:45,406
Finnegan mentioned
you were a barrister.

203
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:46,486
Mm.

204
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:48,486
I think he wants to
follow in your footsteps.

205
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:51,366
According to all the other
teachers, he is.

206
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,166
What is an education
anyway?

207
00:11:55,326 --> 00:11:59,206
I spent most of 1982 learning that
52.8% of Malaysia's GDP

208
00:11:59,366 --> 00:12:00,806
came from rubber.

209
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:02,886
I don't even know if they
produce the stuff anymore.

210
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:05,526
He's a bright boy.
He's falling behind.

211
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:06,526
Why?

212
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:08,126
Because he doesn't
sit up straight in class

213
00:12:08,286 --> 00:12:10,686
and say, “Miss! Miss! Ask me!”?

214
00:12:10,846 --> 00:12:12,886
You know what happens to kids
who do that.

215
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:16,246
Yes. They're in an office somewhere
with their hand up still.

216
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:21,166
Ah. Anyway, that last teacher
seemed quite impressed.

217
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:22,686
Yes, she did.

218
00:12:22,846 --> 00:12:26,246
Yeah. I never had a teacher
who looked like that.

219
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:29,406
I did once see Miss Treadwell
in her bathers.

220
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:33,726
Her varicose veins looked like
an aerial shot of the Nile Delta.

221
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:38,006
Is there a word that means
“even shallower than superficial'?

222
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,726
You still screwing Scarlet?

223
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:42,286
I knew it was a mistake telling you.

224
00:12:42,446 --> 00:12:44,126
No. It was a mistake doing it.

225
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:46,606
And poor Barney. How is he?

226
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:51,726
Doesn't, won't and can't ever know, OK,
Wendy? It's over.

227
00:12:51,886 --> 00:12:54,686
I've learned a very big lesson.

228
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:59,646
Fuzz!
How hot is your English teacher?!

229
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:04,046
Mr Bartrop made it pretty clear he's at
the end of his patience with you.

230
00:13:04,206 --> 00:13:05,806
No-one takes Bartrop seriously.

231
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:08,526
We do and you must.

232
00:13:08,686 --> 00:13:09,526
Sorry. Work.

233
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:11,526
He is the principal of a school

234
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:13,446
that your father and I
spend a fortune on.

235
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:15,126
Isn't that right, Cleave?

236
00:13:15,286 --> 00:13:17,606
10 units, race four.
Charlemagne's Pride.

237
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:19,326
Cleave!
Yes? Yeah.

238
00:13:19,486 --> 00:13:22,606
A fortune. An absolute fortune, mate.

239
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:25,886
No, 15 units!

240
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:29,806
Only to the station.

241
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:32,006
You're a really clever boy,
Fuzz, darling.

242
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,246
If you just knuckle down.
Tell him, Cleave.

243
00:13:34,406 --> 00:13:36,246
To win! When have you
heard me back a place...

244
00:13:36,406 --> 00:13:39,006
Most important years in your life, mate.

245
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:47,030
http://hiqve.com/

246
00:14:00,446 --> 00:14:03,566
Why don't you just
buy your lunch like everyone else?

247
00:14:03,726 --> 00:14:08,646
Because there was a perfectly good
cold roast lamb in the fridge.

248
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,806
So is this how it's gonna be now?

249
00:14:22,966 --> 00:14:26,406
A permanent cone of silence
until one of us dies?

250
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,646
Who's gonna read me a story?

251
00:14:30,806 --> 00:14:32,646
Just read it yourself, OK?
Not now.

252
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,166
OK.

253
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:36,966
Well?

254
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,166
Tell me his name.

255
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:43,726
It doesn't matter now.

256
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:47,206
I'm back here
in the loving bosom of the family.

257
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:48,926
Yes, it DOES matter.

258
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,966
Who did you screw?

259
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:04,246
13 to 1. Yep. Good. See ya.

260
00:15:04,406 --> 00:15:06,206
PDS sent you a murder.

261
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:08,686
Hey, you know we're out of
this room tomorrow?

262
00:15:08,846 --> 00:15:10,566
Oh...

263
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:13,846
A street kid.
Tortured and murdered.

264
00:15:14,006 --> 00:15:15,646
There goes all the fun.

265
00:15:15,806 --> 00:15:18,446
I don't mind adults
whacking each other,

266
00:15:18,606 --> 00:15:20,046
but this stuff twists you.

267
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:22,446
So, Barney will meet you in remand.

268
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:23,686
Barney's instructing?

269
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:25,406
That's good, isn't it?

270
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:26,766
Yeah.

271
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,006
Good. He'll meet you there.

272
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:33,366
Did you know the deceased?

273
00:15:37,046 --> 00:15:39,526
Had you had an argument with him?

274
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:45,166
Had...he tried to rob you?

275
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,486
Provoke you?

276
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:50,246
Had you had sex with him?

277
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:54,366
I'm not into boys.

278
00:15:56,446 --> 00:15:58,726
You're currently living
in a shelter in Abbotsford.

279
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:00,206
Is that right, Denny?

280
00:16:00,366 --> 00:16:04,686
I'm Pica now. Some days, yes.
Other days, no.

281
00:16:08,206 --> 00:16:10,446
The police have your DNA
on the knife,

282
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:13,006
the victim's blood on your clothes.

283
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,206
Witnesses saw you
running from the lane.

284
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:21,166
They may have,
but I didn't do it.

285
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:24,006
He was alive when I found him.

286
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:28,766
I took the knife out but he died.

287
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,686
OK.

288
00:16:34,846 --> 00:16:37,846
Alright, we'll look into it further
and get back to you.

289
00:16:46,246 --> 00:16:48,486
You can't possibly believe him.

290
00:16:48,646 --> 00:16:50,646
We got our instructions.

291
00:16:57,206 --> 00:16:59,606
He got your baggy eyes spot on.

292
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:04,246
Thanks, mate.
Who is he, for Christ's sake?

293
00:17:04,406 --> 00:17:05,766
He is...Pica.

294
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:07,606
What do we know about his prior?

295
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:10,846
Statutory rape. 15-year-old girl.
He was 19.

296
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:13,606
Girl. Interesting.

297
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,086
Do you reckon it was a stitch-up?

298
00:17:15,246 --> 00:17:16,566
Well, come on.

299
00:17:16,726 --> 00:17:19,166
He looks like he did it,
he sounds like he did it,

300
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:22,166
he's homeless,
he's got a serious prior.

301
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:24,006
It's the easiest stitch-up
in the world.

302
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:28,526
Jails are full of guys who are there
because they look like him.

303
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:30,606
No?
No.

304
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,686
So, you guys have sorted things out?

305
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:40,526
We haven't sorted out
a bloody thing.

306
00:17:43,726 --> 00:17:48,686
Hey, you know that guy we met
at the exhibition? Joe Sandilands.

307
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:52,006
The Attorney-General.
He didn't like the painting either.

308
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:56,526
Yeah, well, he wants me to run.

309
00:17:56,686 --> 00:17:59,286
State parliament.

310
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:03,046
Oh.
Dutch Patterson's old seat.

311
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:05,166
It's safe Labor.

312
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:07,806
If I get pre-selection,
I'm a certainty.

313
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:09,766
And is that something you want?

314
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:14,286
Yeah. I never thought I had a chance.

315
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:16,686
I joined Young Labor when I was 16

316
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,526
and went to
God knows how many meetings.

317
00:18:18,686 --> 00:18:21,646
And here all you needed to do
was get shot.

318
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:25,006
You think that's the only reason
they've asked me?

319
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,686
I didn't say that.

320
00:18:26,846 --> 00:18:28,846
No, but you're implying it.

321
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:34,406
Well, they did only notice you after
the tabloids called you ‘hero'.

322
00:18:34,566 --> 00:18:39,126
Oh. OK, fine. I'll stay at the bar
if you're gonna be negative about it.

323
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:41,446
What's it got to do with me?

324
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:43,926
Why is my opinion so significant?

325
00:18:44,086 --> 00:18:45,406
Well, I care what you do.

326
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:48,406
You can do what you want.

327
00:18:48,566 --> 00:18:50,486
All 'm saying is,
from my experience,

328
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:52,286
politicians tend to be...

329
00:18:52,446 --> 00:18:54,366
Let me guess — arrogant, self-indulgent,

330
00:18:54,526 --> 00:18:55,886
trough-sniffing arseholes.

331
00:18:56,046 --> 00:19:00,646
I was going to say ‘sad', mostly.

332
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,846
How many politicians do you know?

333
00:19:03,006 --> 00:19:06,406
A few. Through my dad.

334
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:12,046
Look, I spend half my life trying to get
people like Cleaver Greene

335
00:19:12,206 --> 00:19:13,526
to pay their tax.

336
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,406
How do you think that makes me feel?

337
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,406
This is a chance for me
to do some good.

338
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:20,326
So do it. Knock 'em dead.

339
00:19:21,806 --> 00:19:23,966
I have to go study.

340
00:19:36,006 --> 00:19:37,926
Then let it go...and crouch...

341
00:19:38,086 --> 00:19:39,686
..and hold.

342
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,686
Morning, folks.
Hey.

343
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:43,726
Stretch out the whole body and...

344
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:46,446
Pica hardly sleeps here.
Just comes to paint and read.

345
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:49,006
Have no idea what he does
with the rest of his time.

346
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,766
I shouldn't let him stay, really.
But he's quiet. He's a gentleman.

347
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,966
There you go, my lad.

348
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:00,766
Come on, boys. Out of there.

349
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:45,046
Finnegan!

350
00:20:47,526 --> 00:20:48,846
She is your teacher!

351
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:50,726
She's meant to be telling you
about Jane Austen!

352
00:20:50,886 --> 00:20:53,566
It is age-inappropriate sex!
It's bloody great sex.

353
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:55,686
At your age you should be
having exploratory sex

354
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:59,006
with a girl your own age
and maybe...some oral.

355
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,486
Oh, yuck.

356
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:02,086
The damage you are doing
to your psyche

357
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:03,566
could be irreparable, darling.

358
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:05,046
I know! I'm trained!

359
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:07,446
Well, I'm not ending it.
It is immoral!

360
00:21:07,606 --> 00:21:08,446
Hello!

361
00:21:08,606 --> 00:21:10,046
I thought we didn't buy into
this whole

362
00:21:10,206 --> 00:21:11,686
‘God', ‘myth', ‘mortal sin' bullshit.

363
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:14,966
No, but I believe there's a natural order
and a fine balance to life,

364
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:16,486
and if the rhythms are...

365
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:18,566
Fuck! Fuzz! I want you to stop seeing
the wretched woman!

366
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:21,566
Do you hear me?
Most of the eastern seaboard can!

367
00:21:23,486 --> 00:21:24,966
I'm gonna report her to the school

368
00:21:25,126 --> 00:21:27,606
and she will go to prison
and you can visit her on weekends!

369
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:30,046
You can't stop us!
We love each other!

370
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,246
Oh, now you're being
a petulant little fucking idiot!

371
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:35,206
Is this how you counsel
your suicidal patients?

372
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:52,966
Oh!

373
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:55,206
Come on, Flick.

374
00:21:55,366 --> 00:21:57,166
“Tonight these artists
have come of age.”

375
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:59,206
I deserve to make a living.

376
00:21:59,366 --> 00:22:01,686
You earn yours defending
drug barons and pimps.

377
00:22:01,846 --> 00:22:04,326
And, yes, I do bloody care about
the bloody Congolese.

378
00:22:04,486 --> 00:22:05,926
These are good, aren't they?

379
00:22:06,086 --> 00:22:09,646
He's got your baggy eyes.
Yes, he's good. But you know that.

380
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:11,526
Yeah, but he's VERY good, isn't he?

381
00:22:11,686 --> 00:22:13,166
Need to see more.

382
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:16,926
Goes by the name of ‘Pica'.
Formally known as Denny Lorton.

383
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,526
These are Lorton's? How recent?

384
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:22,006
Who is he, first?
“Who WAS he?”, you mean.

385
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:25,926
Prize student at Courtaulds,
several major exhibitions,

386
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:28,006
two paintings
in the National Gallery.

387
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,086
He was knocking on the door big-time
and then he disappeared.

388
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:32,766
I thought he was dead.

389
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:35,446
Well, he's come back to life.
What are his paintings worth?

390
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:37,286
Depends on the size.

391
00:22:37,446 --> 00:22:38,966
And artistic merit, presumably.

392
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:41,486
Not really. Just size.

393
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:43,766
He used to go for
anything up to 60 grand.

394
00:22:43,926 --> 00:22:45,686
What's he done with all of it?

395
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:49,006
Get him to exhibit here,
maybe I'll forgive you.

396
00:22:50,046 --> 00:22:51,526
No, I won't.

397
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:55,286
This is crap, isn't it, Flick?

398
00:22:55,446 --> 00:22:56,606
Complete.

399
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,326
No, Cleaver,
this time you've gone too far.

400
00:22:58,486 --> 00:23:00,966
I've spoken to the lawyers and you're
never gonna see your son again.

401
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:02,766
I don't know how you can
look at yourself

402
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:04,246
every morning
without throwing up.

403
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:06,206
Oh, am I gonna get a look-in
on this conversation?

404
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:07,886
No, because I know exactly
what you'll say,

405
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:10,246
SO you can spare me
the smart remarks.

406
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:12,886
I don't know how you could let this
happen in your own apartment.

407
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:15,366
Your own son!
Oh, that's what this is about.

408
00:23:15,526 --> 00:23:18,086
Wendy, he's 15 years old, alright?
Almost 16.

409
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:20,046
He's got a girlfriend.

410
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:22,806
Oh, you are genuinely sick
if you think this is appropriate.

411
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:26,246
All I did was save our son 50 bucks
on a room in some flea pit.

412
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:28,566
He's a kid.
He's in love with another kid.

413
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:29,806
With another kid?!

414
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:31,406
Yes, it's a girl
in his English class.

415
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:32,886
He told me all about it.

416
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:37,006
The girl from his English class is his
fucking English teacher, you moron!

417
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,806
Apologies, but I'm in such a hurry.
Oh.

418
00:23:38,966 --> 00:23:41,046
Yes! ‘Oh!' What, you didn't know?

419
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:42,926
No.

420
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:44,926
15 Bray Street, Woollahra, thanks.
No, I didn't, as...

421
00:23:46,086 --> 00:23:49,086
What do you think you're
doing, you bastard? Give those back!

422
00:23:49,246 --> 00:23:52,206
Alright. Have you told the school?
Don't let him in!

423
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:56,246
No, I don't want my son's head pixilated
all over the Sunday papers.

424
00:23:56,406 --> 00:23:58,006
Crown Street, thanks.

425
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:00,726
Where are your manners?
He'll tire of this woman.

426
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:02,966
Boys can't see straight
with a hard-on.

427
00:24:03,126 --> 00:24:05,166
No 15-year-old boy
is gonna tire of a woman

428
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:07,126
shoving perfect tits in his face.

429
00:24:07,286 --> 00:24:09,366
You need to know that
you have ruined his life, OK?

430
00:24:09,526 --> 00:24:10,846
And you have ruined my life.

431
00:24:15,646 --> 00:24:17,926
His English teacher.

432
00:24:23,886 --> 00:24:26,486
You ever have sex
with any of your teachers?

433
00:24:26,646 --> 00:24:28,406
No. Neither did I.

434
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,086
You need a hand with the biros?

435
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:37,126
When I was a student backpacking,
I went to the Prado in Madrid.

436
00:24:37,286 --> 00:24:38,926
I hate art.

437
00:24:39,086 --> 00:24:41,486
I made the mistake of going to
the National Gallery once.

438
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,046
Boring as.

439
00:24:43,206 --> 00:24:44,846
Ah, and with one sentence,

440
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:47,446
2,000 years of civilisation
is dismissed.

441
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:50,086
Bevan didn't mind it, but...
Bevan?

442
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:52,446
Yes. Bevan.

443
00:24:52,606 --> 00:24:55,366
Bevan. Yes. Yes, Bevan.
Your boyfriend Bevan.

444
00:24:55,526 --> 00:24:57,526
Fiance.

445
00:24:57,686 --> 00:25:01,646
Just rooms and rooms full of bleeding
saints and fat cherubs.

446
00:25:01,806 --> 00:25:04,526
There's this room full of
these Goya sketches.

447
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:07,846
Sort of ‘man's inhumanity' stuff.

448
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,126
I could hardly breathe.

449
00:25:10,286 --> 00:25:13,686
Felt a bit the same
when I saw Pica's stuff.

450
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:15,846
Did Goya murder kids too?

451
00:25:16,006 --> 00:25:20,606
No, and you don't judge artists
by the way they live their lives.

452
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:23,966
I don't care if he can
sing, write, paint and dance

453
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:26,246
all at the same time —
an arsehole's an arsehole.

454
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:29,326
Isn't it time you went on a diet?

455
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,086
No. I'm a good weight.

456
00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:33,246
How long have we got this room?

457
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,046
How long does it take to fix cancerous
testicles?

458
00:25:36,206 --> 00:25:40,646
Oh. Oh, jeez, Keith must be pissed.

459
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,686
He never used the bloody things
when he had 'em.

460
00:25:42,846 --> 00:25:45,246
Found out what our boy did
with his money.

461
00:25:45,406 --> 00:25:46,246
Yeah?

462
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:47,926
He paints a masterpiece,

463
00:25:48,086 --> 00:25:51,006
sells it at grunge markets
for a 50th of what it's worth,

464
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,606
then wanders around the city

465
00:25:52,766 --> 00:25:55,406
handing out wads of cash
to homeless people.

466
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:56,926
Jesus Christ.

467
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:57,126
We're defending Jesus Christ!

468
00:25:57,126 --> 00:25:58,806
We're defending Jesus Christ!

469
00:25:58,966 --> 00:25:59,806
Ooh.

470
00:25:59,966 --> 00:26:01,806
I don't need money.
That was Denny Lorton.

471
00:26:01,966 --> 00:26:03,406
My previous life.

472
00:26:03,566 --> 00:26:06,166
Now I find it an intrusion.

473
00:26:06,326 --> 00:26:08,406
So that's what you were
doing in the lane that night.

474
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,886
You were giving Ben Rigby money?

475
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:12,006
I'd been told about him.

476
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:14,886
I'd sold something.

477
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:17,326
I thought he could use the cash
and I could sketch him.

478
00:26:17,486 --> 00:26:18,806
What had you been told?

479
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:22,606
That he was beautiful.
I wanted to see for myself.

480
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:24,526
And you found him dying?

481
00:26:25,846 --> 00:26:28,526
But he was exquisite.

482
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:33,286
There's a photo in the Tate Modern.

483
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,366
Like this.

484
00:26:36,526 --> 00:26:39,966
How we look from 900m up. All dots.

485
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:41,686
An irrelevance.

486
00:26:41,846 --> 00:26:44,686
Don't go metaphysical, mate.
Juries hate that.

487
00:26:44,846 --> 00:26:48,206
The Greeks were terrified
of beauty too.

488
00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:50,846
They saw it as a torment.

489
00:26:51,006 --> 00:26:53,726
Excruciating. Unreachable.

490
00:26:53,886 --> 00:27:00,006
I want to capture the precise moment
when things are exquisite.

491
00:27:04,046 --> 00:27:08,726
Listen, I don't
normally make a habit of asking this,

492
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:12,446
but this time it matters.

493
00:27:12,606 --> 00:27:14,086
Did you murder him?

494
00:27:16,126 --> 00:27:19,366
No. I did not.

495
00:27:25,126 --> 00:27:27,566
Some dots stand out.

496
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:41,046
You OK?

497
00:27:43,126 --> 00:27:44,806
So, why do you
want to run, Dave?

498
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:48,126
I'd like to make a difference.
Oh, yeah? Example?

499
00:27:48,286 --> 00:27:50,366
Well, I think we could try to make
New South Wales

500
00:27:50,526 --> 00:27:52,366
the hardest State in the country
to buy a gun.

501
00:27:52,526 --> 00:27:54,366
Whoa, there. Tread carefully.

502
00:27:54,526 --> 00:27:57,646
Still got a few
very marginal country seats.

503
00:27:57,806 --> 00:27:59,126
Don't want to upset the gun lobby.

504
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:00,726
Fuck's sake, Wal.

505
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:02,206
What's so funny?

506
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:04,486
Wal! You're living in a bubble!

507
00:28:04,646 --> 00:28:06,206
Mate, those seats are gone.

508
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:08,446
They're rooted, and I don't
mean that in a nice way.

509
00:28:08,606 --> 00:28:09,926
That's the status quo and that's...

510
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:11,446
We're not married.

511
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,446
Every year they hold the State
party conference in a different place.

512
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:17,126
It's usually a lot of fun
for the wives.

513
00:28:17,286 --> 00:28:20,126
You know, my Joe's got his eye
on your David.

514
00:28:20,286 --> 00:28:21,886
Why? Is he gay?

515
00:28:22,046 --> 00:28:24,806
Oh!
I don't know what he is sexually.

516
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:27,406
I'm just married to him.

517
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,366
Wendy... Wendy... Stop yelling.

518
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:33,686
Thank you. Listen.

519
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:36,606
Wendy!
Just don't speak to John Bartrop.

520
00:28:36,766 --> 00:28:39,806
Do not speak to him! There's no point in
speaking to Bartrop, OK?

521
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:41,286
Leave the school out of it.

522
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:44,366
I'll talk to Fuzz. Leave it to me.

523
00:28:44,526 --> 00:28:46,846
I'll talk to him and Mrs Robinson.

524
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:49,446
Yes...

525
00:28:50,806 --> 00:28:52,366
Who's John Bartrop?

526
00:28:52,526 --> 00:28:55,246
A puff of air in a mohair cardigan

527
00:28:55,406 --> 00:28:59,366
and my new name of choice
for telemarketers and Mormons.

528
00:29:01,566 --> 00:29:02,646
Right.

529
00:29:02,806 --> 00:29:08,326
Bang! The first cut gets him there and
then he's down, he's dead.

530
00:29:08,486 --> 00:29:13,926
And then bang, bang, bang —
three symmetrical wounds there.

531
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:18,806
And then...
Why do you stab him under there?

532
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:22,166
According to Shrimpton,
Lorton stabs the kid here,

533
00:29:22,326 --> 00:29:25,126
Shrimpton then heroically
runs for help,

534
00:29:25,286 --> 00:29:29,646
Lorton then drags
the now-dead body over here.

535
00:29:29,806 --> 00:29:32,286
Makes no sense.
It's closer to the street.

536
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:36,166
Why would you put it in a place
that's lit up like the SCG?

537
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:39,046
Now, your father was in
the diplomatic service, is that right?

538
00:29:39,206 --> 00:29:40,606
David's told us all about you.

539
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:42,646
Very proud of his wife's
exotic background.

540
00:29:42,806 --> 00:29:44,846
We're not married.
Where exactly was he stationed?

541
00:29:45,006 --> 00:29:47,606
All over. Italy, Spain.
We ended up in Peru.

542
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:49,486
Bloody hell. No way! Peru?

543
00:29:49,646 --> 00:29:51,686
That's where my brother-in-law
was stationed. Bob!

544
00:29:51,846 --> 00:29:53,606
Uh, this was many years ago.

545
00:29:53,766 --> 00:29:55,286
Yeah, 10 years ago he was there.

546
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:57,086
Bob, you great deaf bastard!
Come here!

547
00:29:57,246 --> 00:30:01,726
My phone. Excuse me.

548
00:30:01,886 --> 00:30:05,766
If I was Joe Average,
instead of Joe Sandilands,

549
00:30:05,926 --> 00:30:07,766
I wouldn't be voting for us.

550
00:30:07,926 --> 00:30:09,806
I'd be buying a gun
before Davo here bans them.

551
00:30:09,966 --> 00:30:11,446
I'd be putting a fucking bullet
in my head.

552
00:30:11,606 --> 00:30:13,166
I think you've had
enough there, Joe.

553
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:15,206
No, Wal.
Wal, I've only just begun, brother.

554
00:30:15,366 --> 00:30:17,886
This man here is exactly
what this party needs.

555
00:30:18,046 --> 00:30:20,446
We need 20 of 'em
and we need 'em bloody quick.

556
00:30:30,006 --> 00:30:33,046
Ooh! Uh, we're almost done,
aren't we, cock?

557
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,966
See you, mate.
Yeah.

558
00:30:42,566 --> 00:30:45,606
You know what my first act will be when
I run this country?

559
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:47,446
Make threesomes compulsory?

560
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:53,766
OK, but my second act will be to abolish
five-day weather forecasts

561
00:30:53,926 --> 00:30:56,446
and publicly execute
those who give them.

562
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:58,606
Some might say ‘extreme'.

563
00:30:58,766 --> 00:31:01,286
Sunday night, some guy who believes

564
00:31:01,446 --> 00:31:03,526
he has a personality
‘cause he wears a bow tie

565
00:31:03,686 --> 00:31:06,966
says, “It's galoshes day Monday, folks.”

566
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:11,286
Then this lunatic pretends to tell me
the weather for the next five days.

567
00:31:11,446 --> 00:31:13,646
Folks might find this useful
in the planning of a week.

568
00:31:13,806 --> 00:31:16,926
Well, folks would be deceived,
because by Tuesday night,

569
00:31:17,086 --> 00:31:20,766
Bow Tie has changed his forecast
for two of the five nights

570
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:22,246
but won't admit it.

571
00:31:22,406 --> 00:31:25,126
Your point being,
if it's a five-day weather forecast,

572
00:31:25,286 --> 00:31:27,206
how come he changes his mind
every night?

573
00:31:27,366 --> 00:31:28,846
Clearly he can't, hey?

574
00:31:29,006 --> 00:31:31,406
Kill him,
Compassionately, but yes.

575
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:37,846
I'm sorry. Um...
What have you come as, hey?

576
00:31:38,006 --> 00:31:42,286
What's the emergency?
Where's hero — sorry — tax boy?

577
00:31:42,446 --> 00:31:45,086
I just abandoned him
at Parliament House.

578
00:31:45,246 --> 00:31:47,686
It was unbearable.
They want him to run.

579
00:31:47,846 --> 00:31:51,166
Oh, God strike at my vitals.

580
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:02,766
What am I doing? This is mad.
I should go.

581
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:05,566
Come on. I just hauled my arse halfway
across town.

582
00:32:05,726 --> 00:32:07,526
I'm sorry.

583
00:32:07,686 --> 00:32:10,726
Look, there's a hotel
across the road there.

584
00:32:10,886 --> 00:32:13,766
We could grab a room
and really thrash this thing out.

585
00:32:13,926 --> 00:32:16,166
It's not gonna happen.
No?

586
00:32:16,326 --> 00:32:20,286
Come on. Well, why'd you call?
Why do you keep dropping in?

587
00:32:20,446 --> 00:32:23,046
Fine. I won't.
No, I'm not saying that.

588
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:25,246
I'm just saying, “Why? Why?”

589
00:32:25,406 --> 00:32:30,886
I don't know and...I can't stay.

590
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:33,886
Oh, well, this has been
a cracker day for me.

591
00:32:34,046 --> 00:32:36,846
I'm only trying to get
an innocent man off murder charges.

592
00:32:37,006 --> 00:32:38,606
I'm happy for the distraction, yeah?

593
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:40,766
I thought everyone
you defended was guilty.

594
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:48,806
Do you remember that long weekend
we spent together?

595
00:32:50,486 --> 00:32:52,006
Yeah. Yes.

596
00:32:52,166 --> 00:32:55,366
Son of Astor paid for it.
Came in 10 to 1.

597
00:32:55,526 --> 00:33:00,806
I had you for four beautiful days
all to myself.

598
00:33:00,966 --> 00:33:04,726
In the Margaret River.
And I really slept there, didn't 1?

599
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:06,486
Yes, you did. Yeah.

600
00:33:06,646 --> 00:33:08,086
And it's pretty much
all you did, actually.

601
00:33:08,246 --> 00:33:11,246
You snuggled up and...snoozed.

602
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,286
I didn't mind. I had in-house porn.

603
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:22,606
Call me any time!

604
00:33:27,926 --> 00:33:29,246
It's gonna be a bit messy.

605
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:30,726
Oh, Sal!

606
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:34,686
Um, David... My wife, uh, Sally.

607
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,606
David. Oh, nice to meet you.
Pleasure.

608
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,526
Shall we get you home?

609
00:33:44,686 --> 00:33:47,806
I was passing.
Mm-hm.

610
00:33:47,966 --> 00:33:53,286
Am I correct in remembering
you handled a drug case two years ago

611
00:33:53,446 --> 00:33:55,286
where the key witness
was a guy called Shrimpton?

612
00:33:55,446 --> 00:33:58,086
Stanley Shrimpton.

613
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:00,766
You got a conviction
on the basis of his testimony.

614
00:34:00,926 --> 00:34:03,886
That's what you've come here
to talk about?

615
00:34:04,046 --> 00:34:09,886
Yeah, I think I might be defending
a genuinely innocent guy.

616
00:34:10,046 --> 00:34:13,406
I mean, an actually innocent guy.

617
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:22,766
Why did you go to bed with me
if you didn't want me?

618
00:34:22,926 --> 00:34:26,086
Hm? Was it just about landing me?

619
00:34:26,246 --> 00:34:29,366
Once I'm flapping about on the deck
I'm just a dead fish.

620
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:32,646
What are you talking about,
‘landing' you, Red?

621
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:34,566
We'd already done it before.

622
00:34:36,046 --> 00:34:39,366
So you tell me, then.
Why did you want me?

623
00:34:39,526 --> 00:34:42,286
Because at that precise moment

624
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:45,566
there was no-one more beautiful
on earth and I had to have you.

625
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:49,126
No, no, no. You're so full of shit.

626
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,526
OK.

627
00:34:57,566 --> 00:35:00,766
Because I was drowning and because...

628
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:06,726
..you were a life buoy and...
you were in the same wet place.

629
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,886
Stanley Shrimpton.

630
00:35:18,486 --> 00:35:21,646
A piece of vermin who got off
child abuse charges

631
00:35:21,806 --> 00:35:24,726
by becoming a police informant.

632
00:35:24,886 --> 00:35:27,886
Now...go, will you?

633
00:35:33,646 --> 00:35:35,646
Thanks, Red.

634
00:35:53,246 --> 00:35:57,726
OK. I'm sorry. I was bored stupid.

635
00:35:57,886 --> 00:35:59,926
What happened?
Nothing.

636
00:36:00,086 --> 00:36:03,086
I got trapped between one woman

637
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:04,926
who was advocating
tougher tort reform

638
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:07,726
and one who wanted to style herself
after Michelle Obama.

639
00:36:07,886 --> 00:36:10,966
You were gone almost an hour.
I felt like an idiot.

640
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:12,846
I had to tell everyone
you'd gone home sick.

641
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:15,926
I'm sorry, darling.
No. Stuff ‘sorry'. What happened?

642
00:36:19,006 --> 00:36:21,526
One of your new playmates
has a brother-in-law

643
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:24,446
who may have known my father
when we were in Peru.

644
00:36:24,606 --> 00:36:26,726
So?

645
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:30,486
There was a woman at the embassy.
She was a translator.

646
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,446
My father had an affair with her.

647
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:37,726
Turns out this woman was,
I don't know, some sort of spy.

648
00:36:37,886 --> 00:36:39,926
But it ruined my father's career

649
00:36:40,086 --> 00:36:42,686
and it drove my mother
to the brink of suicide.

650
00:36:42,846 --> 00:36:45,006
And I suppose that's where
cousin Angus comes in.

651
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:46,566
Yes!

652
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:49,446
Everything turned to shit.

653
00:36:50,766 --> 00:36:53,206
My father ended his career
in disgrace

654
00:36:53,366 --> 00:36:56,646
and, frankly, I didn't want to talk about it
in front of those buffoons.

655
00:36:56,806 --> 00:36:59,766
Don't think it would've helped
your career much.

656
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:05,806
Now I feel like a shit.

657
00:37:08,046 --> 00:37:10,326
I won't put you through that again.

658
00:37:10,486 --> 00:37:13,646
How is that possible?

659
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,966
You want me to drop this thing?

660
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:22,246
No. You have to do
what you have to do.

661
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,526
I mean, I'm not proud
of what Dad did,

662
00:37:25,686 --> 00:37:29,166
but there isn't a day that goes by
I don't miss him.

663
00:37:29,326 --> 00:37:35,566
♪ I walked for miles
on shifting sands

664
00:37:35,726 --> 00:37:39,286
♪ A cold, cold wind did blow

665
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:47,086
♪ I look in the night sky
and all I can see

666
00:37:47,246 --> 00:37:53,406
♪ Are buckets of tears
raining down on me

667
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:58,006
♪ And I lay my head down low

668
00:38:00,326 --> 00:38:04,406
♪ Lay my head down low

669
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:07,326
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh. ♪

670
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,806
We have the murder weapon,

671
00:38:09,966 --> 00:38:14,646
DNA evidence, the deceased's blood
was found on the accused

672
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:18,926
and, most importantly,
we have an eye witness.

673
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:23,566
This is a particularly heinous crime.

674
00:38:23,726 --> 00:38:27,486
The death of a lad who knew
nothing but grief and hardship.

675
00:38:27,646 --> 00:38:32,006
Such crimes make us question
our very humanity.

676
00:38:33,326 --> 00:38:36,046
Lorton's prints
were on the murder weapon.

677
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:38,966
Uh, the victim's blood
was found on his shirt,

678
00:38:39,126 --> 00:38:42,366
under his fingernails and on
his shoes when we arrested him.

679
00:38:42,526 --> 00:38:47,646
I must warn members of the jury
that they are very disturbing.

680
00:38:51,326 --> 00:38:55,046
Detective, can you describe
the nature of these wounds?

681
00:38:55,206 --> 00:38:58,806
The knife into the back of the head
severed his spinal cord.

682
00:38:58,966 --> 00:39:03,086
This was followed by
three stab wounds down his torso,

683
00:39:03,246 --> 00:39:04,806
one in his armpit.

684
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:07,926
According to the coroner,
the coagulation of the blood

685
00:39:08,086 --> 00:39:11,486
suggests that all of these were done
after Benjamin had died.

686
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:13,406
As in a sort of ritual killing?

687
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:14,766
Objection.

688
00:39:14,926 --> 00:39:17,726
Detective Maraco,
please confine your remarks

689
00:39:17,886 --> 00:39:19,766
to matters pertaining
to your investigation.

690
00:39:19,926 --> 00:39:21,486
You're not a medical expert.

691
00:39:21,646 --> 00:39:25,326
And, Mr Dalton,
you should know better.

692
00:39:25,486 --> 00:39:28,486
My apologies, Your Honour.

693
00:39:35,886 --> 00:39:39,526
Uh, Detective, you've conducted

694
00:39:39,686 --> 00:39:42,406
a pretty thorough investigation here,
haven't you?

695
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:43,886
No stone unturned.

696
00:39:44,046 --> 00:39:46,726
It was a... Yeah, it was
a thorough investigation, yes.

697
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:50,446
What was the boy doing
in that lane, Detective?

698
00:39:50,606 --> 00:39:51,886
Soliciting.

699
00:39:52,046 --> 00:39:53,886
So he was a lawyer?

700
00:39:54,046 --> 00:39:56,086
He was performing oral sex.

701
00:39:56,246 --> 00:39:58,886
So he was a male prostitute.

702
00:39:59,046 --> 00:40:01,366
Who were his clients, Detective?

703
00:40:01,526 --> 00:40:04,086
Uh, beautiful fashion models?

704
00:40:04,246 --> 00:40:06,166
Romanian princesses?

705
00:40:06,326 --> 00:40:07,366
Men.

706
00:40:07,526 --> 00:40:11,966
Plump, wheezing,
sweaty, middle-aged men

707
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:13,646
with 50 bucks to spend.

708
00:40:13,806 --> 00:40:15,126
I wouldn't know.

709
00:40:15,286 --> 00:40:16,486
How many men...

710
00:40:16,646 --> 00:40:20,686
..had he transacted
that evening, Detective?

711
00:40:20,846 --> 00:40:22,606
We don't know. Several.

712
00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:26,046
Several. So is that, uh, six, seven?

713
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:27,726
Could be.

714
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:30,566
Oh, so he could've serviced
a whole league team.

715
00:40:30,726 --> 00:40:36,446
Detective, presumably you've had
semen tests performed, yes?

716
00:40:36,606 --> 00:40:39,526
Yes, we did.
Uh, most of it was ingested.

717
00:40:39,686 --> 00:40:40,726
In his stomach?

718
00:40:40,886 --> 00:40:42,566
Yes.

719
00:40:42,726 --> 00:40:45,126
Alright, so my client's sperm
was in there?

720
00:40:45,286 --> 00:40:47,126
Uh, no, it doesn't appear so.

721
00:40:47,286 --> 00:40:53,046
So, I'm sorry, but a veritable bevy of
unknown men

722
00:40:53,206 --> 00:40:56,286
abuse this boy and then disappear

723
00:40:56,446 --> 00:40:59,206
back to the bosom
of their loving families,

724
00:40:59,366 --> 00:41:03,206
and yet the only man
the police investigate is my client,

725
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:07,646
who's the only man we know for sure
didn't have sex with Ben Rigby.

726
00:41:07,806 --> 00:41:10,126
Mm...the boy was seen alive

727
00:41:10,286 --> 00:41:13,446
just before Mr Lorton
went into the lane.

728
00:41:13,606 --> 00:41:19,206
What if my client had stumbled
onto the boy already dying?

729
00:41:19,366 --> 00:41:24,246
Killed not by him, but by any one of
these anonymous gentlefolk

730
00:41:24,406 --> 00:41:26,046
that he'd recently serviced?

731
00:41:26,206 --> 00:41:30,086
We have a witness who says he saw
Mr Lorton murder the boy.

732
00:41:30,246 --> 00:41:32,326
Or could he have, at that distance,

733
00:41:32,486 --> 00:41:37,566
seen my client, in fact,
REMOVE the knife?

734
00:41:37,726 --> 00:41:42,206
And if so, would he not be awash
in Ben Rigby's blood?

735
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:47,166
Could that not explain the blood
on my client, Detective?

736
00:41:49,326 --> 00:41:50,406
Possibly.

737
00:41:50,566 --> 00:41:52,846
Is ‘possibly'
another word for ‘yes'?

738
00:41:53,006 --> 00:41:55,926
Yes. Possibly.

739
00:41:57,646 --> 00:42:00,446
No further questions,
Your Honour.

740
00:42:07,846 --> 00:42:09,206
That was it, hey?

741
00:42:09,366 --> 00:42:11,326
Seen him go into the lane,
pull out the knife,

742
00:42:11,486 --> 00:42:12,966
stab the poor little bastard.

743
00:42:13,126 --> 00:42:15,366
Pica was off his nut.

744
00:42:15,526 --> 00:42:17,806
Thank you, Mr Shrimpton.

745
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:38,166
Is this the first time
you've given evidence

746
00:42:38,326 --> 00:42:39,846
in a criminal trial, Mr Shrimpton?

747
00:42:40,006 --> 00:42:41,846
No.

748
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:44,286
Murder cases?

749
00:42:44,446 --> 00:42:46,606
No, uh, drug cases.

750
00:42:46,766 --> 00:42:49,126
‘CASES'. I see.

751
00:42:49,286 --> 00:42:53,046
Isn't it true that
on three occasions

752
00:42:53,206 --> 00:42:55,686
you've been granted immunity
from prosecution

753
00:42:55,846 --> 00:42:58,966
if you testified against the accused in
these drug cases?

754
00:42:59,126 --> 00:43:00,246
Objection.

755
00:43:00,406 --> 00:43:05,566
Your Honour, my client's future rests on
the testimony of this man

756
00:43:05,726 --> 00:43:07,646
and this man only.

757
00:43:12,286 --> 00:43:16,806
I'll allow it, but no
fishing expeditions, Mr Greene.

758
00:43:16,966 --> 00:43:19,286
Your Honour.

759
00:43:21,486 --> 00:43:24,046
Mr Shrimpton,
you said you know my client.

760
00:43:24,206 --> 00:43:26,806
Seen him around.

761
00:43:26,966 --> 00:43:29,246
Did he ever give you money?

762
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,446
Yeah. Yeah. Once he did.

763
00:43:32,606 --> 00:43:34,726
He helped a lot of homeless people,
didn't he?

764
00:43:34,886 --> 00:43:38,046
He used to come round.
Paint us. Give out cash.

765
00:43:38,206 --> 00:43:41,366
In fact, he gave away
thousands of dollars, didn't he?

766
00:43:41,526 --> 00:43:43,526
Fair bit.

767
00:43:43,686 --> 00:43:48,966
It was you who led my client
to the lane that night, wasn't it?

768
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,646
He said he wanted to paint him.

769
00:43:51,806 --> 00:43:56,206
Because you told Denny, and I quote,

770
00:43:56,366 --> 00:43:59,126
“‘Benny's an effing little Adonis.”

771
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:01,366
Yeah, I don't remember
me exact words.

772
00:44:01,526 --> 00:44:05,326
Uh, had you had oral sex yourself

773
00:44:05,486 --> 00:44:08,246
with Ben Rigby that evening?

774
00:44:10,726 --> 00:44:12,406
Come on, Mr Shrimpton.

775
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:16,006
Maybe a brief but therapeutic tryst
up a back lane.

776
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:18,646
Yeah, but, you know,
just a quick one.

777
00:44:18,806 --> 00:44:19,646
Take comfort.

778
00:44:19,806 --> 00:44:22,446
Premature ejaculation's
not on trial here.

779
00:44:24,206 --> 00:44:26,646
Listen, pal,
I seen that sick bastard there

780
00:44:26,806 --> 00:44:28,446
whack that poor little kiddie.

781
00:44:28,606 --> 00:44:30,126
And yet you did nothing to stop him.

782
00:44:30,286 --> 00:44:33,566
Went and got help, didn't 1?
Maybe you went and got an alibi.

783
00:44:35,646 --> 00:44:38,526
See, I'm at a bit of a loss,
Mr Shrimpton.

784
00:44:38,686 --> 00:44:42,846
You say my client kills the boy

785
00:44:43,006 --> 00:44:44,366
he's gone to give money to

786
00:44:44,526 --> 00:44:46,446
and then instead of bolting,

787
00:44:46,606 --> 00:44:49,606
he drags his body 30m down a lane

788
00:44:49,766 --> 00:44:52,886
and then hangs around for 15 minutes.

789
00:44:53,046 --> 00:44:54,366
Why would he do that?

790
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:55,886
Ask him.

791
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:03,766
More incredible, he now places
the body under a streetlight.

792
00:45:03,926 --> 00:45:05,686
Would you do that, Mr Shrimpton?

793
00:45:05,846 --> 00:45:09,766
If, in the terribly unlikely event you were
to have killed somebody,

794
00:45:09,926 --> 00:45:14,446
would you do a runner or
would you take 15 precious minutes

795
00:45:14,606 --> 00:45:18,926
to drag the body so that you could place
it under a street lamp

796
00:45:19,086 --> 00:45:21,526
in full view of the street?

797
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:24,406
Hey, listen,
I haven't killed no-one.

798
00:45:24,566 --> 00:45:27,926
You've just confessed to the court,
Mr Shrimpton,

799
00:45:28,086 --> 00:45:32,166
of a Clintonesque interlude
with a minor.

800
00:45:32,326 --> 00:45:35,086
Have you been charged with
this offence, Mr Shrimpton?

801
00:45:35,246 --> 00:45:37,046
No.

802
00:45:37,206 --> 00:45:38,046
Really?

803
00:45:38,206 --> 00:45:41,486
Have you done another grubby deal with
the police, Mr Shrimpton?

804
00:45:41,646 --> 00:45:43,686
Ob... Objection!

805
00:45:43,846 --> 00:45:45,526
I withdraw it.

806
00:45:45,686 --> 00:45:47,846
Thank you, Your Honour.

807
00:45:49,366 --> 00:45:51,406
That was better than sex.

808
00:45:51,566 --> 00:45:54,246
Then you're not
trying hard enough, cock.

809
00:45:55,606 --> 00:45:57,526
I've gotta make way
for another couple of beers.

810
00:45:57,686 --> 00:46:01,166
Congratulations.
Name in the papers, yet again.

811
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:03,086
Mwah. Good result.

812
00:46:03,246 --> 00:46:04,686
Lorton did do it, you know.

813
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:07,206
Well, then, you should've made
a better case, mate.

814
00:46:07,366 --> 00:46:08,726
Couldn't. Hands were tied.

815
00:46:08,886 --> 00:46:10,406
There you go.

816
00:46:10,566 --> 00:46:13,526
You know how your bloke did time
for that statutory rape?

817
00:46:13,686 --> 00:46:17,246
Yeah, he was 19, she was 16.
It was bullshit.

818
00:46:17,406 --> 00:46:18,246
Exactly.

819
00:46:18,406 --> 00:46:22,286
I kept asking myself how it ever
made it to court, so I checked.

820
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,166
It turns out your boy
slashed the girl with a knife.

821
00:46:25,326 --> 00:46:26,926
Both breasts.

822
00:46:27,086 --> 00:46:29,206
Sex with a minor
was all they could get him on.

823
00:46:29,366 --> 00:46:30,686
Why was that?

824
00:46:30,846 --> 00:46:32,846
She wouldn't cooperate.

825
00:46:33,006 --> 00:46:36,526
Said he was a ‘genius' and apparently
that's what geniuses do.

826
00:46:36,686 --> 00:46:40,206
I wouldn't know what geniuses do.
I'm just a dumb-arse cop.

827
00:46:40,366 --> 00:46:42,366
I know nothin' about art.

828
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:45,206
Sleep well, Mr Greene.

829
00:47:00,126 --> 00:47:01,566
I hear you had a big win.

830
00:47:01,726 --> 00:47:05,246
Oh, for God's sake, Barney. Alright.

831
00:47:09,886 --> 00:47:12,726
He was a man that I met
at the Adelaide conference.

832
00:47:12,886 --> 00:47:15,486
He's English.

833
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:18,926
And he is now safely back
in Devon with his wife

834
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,966
and he will never, ever
come back here.

835
00:47:22,126 --> 00:47:24,006
What's his name?

836
00:47:24,166 --> 00:47:26,966
Does it matter now?
You don't know him.

837
00:47:27,126 --> 00:47:28,846
And I'm never gonna see him again.

838
00:47:29,006 --> 00:47:30,006
OK!

839
00:47:31,846 --> 00:47:33,926
OK.

840
00:47:37,526 --> 00:47:39,006
John.

841
00:47:41,766 --> 00:47:43,086
Bartrop.

842
00:47:43,246 --> 00:47:47,406
John Bartrop. There.

843
00:47:49,486 --> 00:47:50,846
You happy now?

844
00:48:11,326 --> 00:48:13,566
‘Bleeding saints'.

845
00:48:35,366 --> 00:48:38,606
Recognise this? Guido Reni.

846
00:48:40,846 --> 00:48:43,326
In six months
the streets would've made him ugly.

847
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:46,286
He would've died in a crack haze
down some lane.

848
00:48:46,446 --> 00:48:48,926
I gave him that.
His moment of absolute perfection.

849
00:48:49,086 --> 00:48:52,206
No. You killed a kid,
you insane prick!

850
00:48:52,366 --> 00:48:55,686
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

851
00:48:55,846 --> 00:48:57,406
I'm going to the cops.

852
00:48:57,566 --> 00:48:59,366
With what?

853
00:48:59,526 --> 00:49:02,686
A picture painted 400 years ago?

854
00:49:02,846 --> 00:49:04,886
I will find a way, I swear to God.

855
00:49:05,046 --> 00:49:07,526
There is no way and you know it.

856
00:49:07,686 --> 00:49:10,126
Camus said... Ugh!

857
00:49:10,286 --> 00:49:13,606
Fuck Camus.

858
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:43,686
Fuzzball. Come in. Come in.

859
00:49:43,846 --> 00:49:45,966
Fiona, welcome. Welcome.

860
00:49:46,126 --> 00:49:48,126
Where's your stuff?

861
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:50,086
Oh, I'm not staying the night.

862
00:49:50,246 --> 00:49:52,086
Oh, well, you're very welcome.

863
00:49:52,246 --> 00:49:54,966
The old, uh, sofa bed
might be a little bit cramped

864
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:57,486
and the place has had
a health warning slapped on it.

865
00:49:57,646 --> 00:50:00,846
No, thank you. I...I just wanted
to explain my position.

866
00:50:01,006 --> 00:50:02,766
Oh, nothing to explain.

867
00:50:02,926 --> 00:50:04,766
It's all done, isn't it?
Told you he'd be cool.

868
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:08,206
Mum's given us so much shit.
Well, you know mothers.

869
00:50:08,366 --> 00:50:12,086
But what I feel for your son,
it's very sincere.

870
00:50:12,246 --> 00:50:13,366
Great.

871
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:18,166
So, mate, I've got your favourite here.
Burgers and chips.

872
00:50:18,326 --> 00:50:20,486
Is that OK with you, Fi...
Oh, you're not staying.

873
00:50:20,646 --> 00:50:22,966
Finnegan, would you mind
grabbing my purse?

874
00:50:23,126 --> 00:50:24,566
I think I left it in the car.

875
00:50:24,726 --> 00:50:27,086
She's got you on the hop already, mate.

876
00:50:28,806 --> 00:50:29,806
Sit down.

877
00:50:32,286 --> 00:50:38,166
[, um... I know he's young.

878
00:50:39,966 --> 00:50:42,366
But there's something...so special.

879
00:50:42,526 --> 00:50:44,486
Beautiful.

880
00:50:45,846 --> 00:50:47,686
I tried to, well, resist it,
believe me.

881
00:50:47,846 --> 00:50:52,526
I-I tried, but...what we have now
is extremely honest and good.

882
00:50:53,806 --> 00:50:55,526
You sure I can't tempt you
with a burger?

883
00:50:55,686 --> 00:50:57,006
Uh, no...

884
00:50:57,166 --> 00:50:59,046
Come on. We've got 'matie sauce. No?

885
00:50:59,206 --> 00:51:01,366
I-l wanna find a way
to make this work.

886
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:03,526
l...I want to protect him emotionally

887
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:05,246
and care for his academic future.

888
00:51:05,406 --> 00:51:08,086
Sorry. Did you say ‘protect him'?
Yes.

889
00:51:10,006 --> 00:51:11,326
You're delusional.

890
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:15,046
You think I'M delusional?

891
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:17,046
From what Finnegan tells me
about you, it sounds like...

892
00:51:17,206 --> 00:51:20,246
Oh, listen, Fiona,
I know I'm a sinner, alright?

893
00:51:20,406 --> 00:51:23,766
I know, because despite the enormity

894
00:51:23,926 --> 00:51:26,406
of what you are doing
with my beautiful boy,

895
00:51:26,566 --> 00:51:30,966
I would fuck you in a heartbeat
if he wasn't coming back in a minute.

896
00:51:31,126 --> 00:51:33,566
Do you really wanna turn him into me?

897
00:51:33,726 --> 00:51:37,646
The best thing you can do
for Fuzz right now, believe me,

898
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:42,326
is go downstairs, get in your car
and get driving and KEEP driving,

899
00:51:42,486 --> 00:51:45,566
preferably until you find
some sort of elevated landform

900
00:51:45,726 --> 00:51:48,526
and then keep driving
a little bit more, OK?

901
00:51:48,686 --> 00:51:51,286
Let's go, Fi.

902
00:51:52,406 --> 00:51:53,846
Fuck, Dad.
Fuzz...

903
00:51:54,006 --> 00:51:55,686
Fuzz...

904
00:51:57,126 --> 00:51:58,126
Mate...

905
00:52:20,566 --> 00:52:22,606
Sorry to call late, cock.
I was up.

906
00:52:22,766 --> 00:52:25,886
I just needed to hear
a friendly voice.

907
00:52:27,486 --> 00:52:31,486
It's been...one prick of a day.

908
00:52:31,646 --> 00:52:32,726
Yeah?

909
00:52:32,886 --> 00:52:34,046
First Lorton...

910
00:52:34,206 --> 00:52:36,366
One of the many things
Scarlet hates about me

911
00:52:36,526 --> 00:52:40,286
is my inability to lose my temper,
so I won't even try now.

912
00:52:40,446 --> 00:52:44,886
But let's have nothing more
to do with each other, OK?

913
00:52:47,286 --> 00:52:50,606
Barn, what the hell are you...
Ask Scarlet about John Bartrop.

914
00:52:50,766 --> 00:52:53,126
You were joking about him, remember?

915
00:52:53,286 --> 00:52:55,366
In the alley where
Ben Rigby was killed.

916
00:52:55,526 --> 00:52:56,846
What did you call him?

917
00:52:57,006 --> 00:52:59,046
“A puff of wind
in a mohair cardigan.”

918
00:52:59,206 --> 00:53:01,446
You know, even when
you're destroying lives,

919
00:53:01,606 --> 00:53:04,246
somehow it still comes out
as a bloody joke.
