1
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,190
You've got it everywhere!

2
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,030
Nicky, stop it!

3
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,780
Good evening. Noctis police.

4
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,780
Already? Come in.

5
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,780
You have something there.

6
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,610
No, wait. There.

7
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,440
- Hello?
- Your appointment has arrived.

8
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,400
Good, show her up.

9
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,280
You haven't said
whether you want breakfast tomorrow.

10
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,990
- No, thanks.
- It's complimentary.

11
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,280
Yes, thank you, but I'm a robot.

12
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,820
She's coming.

13
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:53,967
I'm ready.

14
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,780
- Sorry you're taking all the risks.
- Don't worry.

15
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,610
Maybe there won't be any problem.

16
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,820
Check her ID first.

17
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:04,607
You're breaking up.

18
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,070
- Can you hear me?
- And you?

19
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,570
It's getting worse.

20
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,190
Someone's jamming us.

21
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:11,091
Should we abort?

22
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,570
Hello.

23
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,440
- Were you jamming us?
- Yes.

24
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,570
I don't want
the whole world to know.

25
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,320
We've taken every precaution.

26
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,780
But your jamming impedes our work.

27
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,940
A drink?

28
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,190
Sobriety mode activated.

29
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,530
I'm in AA.

30
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,990
Oh, sorry.

31
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,030
Are you aware of the consequences
of jailbreaking him?

32
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,400
I'll no longer be constrained
by cyber-laws.

33
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,610
I'll be free to steal, kill
and even swear.

34
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,360
I'll be an outlaw,
subject to disassembly.

35
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,780
Will you do the jailbreaking?

36
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,530
Where's the woman I was talking to?

37
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,110
She'll be with us
the moment you switch off your jammer.

38
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,490
That's a lot better!

39
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,690
Hello.

40
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,570
No, a VIGIL-2!

41
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,150
A classic! What OS are you packing?

42
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,570
I'm running on ExOS 4.

43
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,150
Right!

44
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,280
LEM will scan you.
If you're kosher, we'll begin.

45
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,965
If you don't mind.

46
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,240
Find her. I'm nailed in 5 seconds!

47
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,530
She's in the building.

48
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,570
I'm checking my database.

49
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,570
Hurry, hurry!

50
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,030
I'm almost there.

51
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,530
She's a P.I.! Abort!

52
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,110
Room 3017!

53
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,900
Lock!

54
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,610
Are you really going
to play that game?

55
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,740
Great!

56
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,780
Dear friends,
you can all go fuck yourselves!

57
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,740
Carlos, status?

58
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,070
All fine. Catch her.

59
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,360
Close the window!

60
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,690
You can't do this, you're a robot!

61
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,690
I command you to let me go!
Directive 7!

62
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,280
Shit!

63
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,070
Roberta Williams.

64
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,490
Warrant 71-635.
Aggravated hacking.

65
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,780
We're going home.

66
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,820
Your attention, please.

67
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,400
Would passengers
on Rocosmos flight FC805

68
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,690
to L-Copernic

69
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,490
please now proceed to Gate B.

70
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,320
Did Royjacker send you?

71
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,360
You know that bastard
hacked my servers?

72
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,190
All I did was give him
what he had coming to him.

73
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,530
You know you're the bad guys.

74
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,570
By jailbreaking the androids,
I set them free.

75
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,280
In Novigrad we saw what happens
when they're set free.

76
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,940
We don't really know
what happened there.

77
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,016
Oh, yeah?

78
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,940
The robots in our unit started
shooting at us. So I do know!

79
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,990
You were in Novigrad?

80
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,780
Mars Express flight ME187 to Noctis
is now boarding.

81
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,190
That's us!

82
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,110
FRED AVRIL
PHILIPPE MONTHAYE

83
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,610
Check again, that's impossible!

84
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,150
Warrants don't disappear!

85
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,240
There are a few ways to do it.

86
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,240
Sorry, there's no warrant
for a Roberta Williams.

87
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,150
Don't you have a copy?

88
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,780
It's on the office servers.
Accessing...

89
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,530
We've been chasing this scumbag
for three weeks.

90
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,150
Sh...

91
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,440
It's been erased.

92
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,610
What?

93
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,110
How mysterious!

94
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,280
Sorry to point this out,
but isn't it illegal

95
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,860
to cuff honest citizens?

96
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,690
The lady's right.

97
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,070
Thank you.

98
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,030
- Hi, Beryl.
- Hi, sweetie.

99
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,820
How was Earth?

100
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,900
The same old slum
for the unemployed.

101
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,400
Is Chris available?

102
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,070
Didn't you know? He's retired me.

103
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,820
- Really?
- I'll transfer you to the new one.

104
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,110
- Are you okay?
- Don't worry, I'm keeping busy.

105
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,610
See you soon! I'll put you through.

106
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,570
Hello, Aline. I'm Jeanine.

107
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,240
Chris Royjacker
is waiting in your office.

108
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,900
- Hi, Chris.
- Hey, pals!

109
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,070
So, Earth? Nice to be home, huh?

110
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,610
Yes.

111
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,190
Hi, Carlos.

112
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,490
- Have you read my report?
- Yes, I have.

113
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,360
They let Roberta Williams go.

114
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,360
- I'm not letting her off that easy.
- Forget it!

115
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,650
Her computer burnt,
that's all I care about.

116
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,610
What data did she steal from you?

117
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,780
Forget it, I said.
It doesn't matter anymore.

118
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,740
Enjoy yourself,
go out, meet some people.

119
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,150
See you soon. Ciao!

120
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:50,150
Does the Gliese 581 solar system

121
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:52,322
have a Goldilocks planet?

122
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,854
That's the question humanity
asked the universe 53 years ago,

123
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,032
when it sent the Ekinci probe.

124
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,654
It's 20 years
since Ekinci dropped into orbit

125
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,740
around exoplanet Gliese 581D.

126
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,512
We will soon start receiving
its first data transmissions.

127
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,360
So... who's tempted by the stars?

128
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,610
No problem.
It's just doing a little update.

129
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,490
But I have an appointment.

130
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,440
Can't you finish it?
It won't take long.

131
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,940
Apart from the hand, are you okay?

132
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,900
Your analyses show that you haven't
fallen off the wagon.

133
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,320
The first three months
are the hardest.

134
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,900
There we go, see!

135
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,280
Mr. Chow?

136
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,860
Aline Ruby.

137
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,530
Carlos didn't let you in?

138
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,900
Oh, yes.

139
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,440
He's updating too.

140
00:15:49,945 --> 00:15:53,360
My daughter, Jun.
We've had no news for three days.

141
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,570
The police are after her for hacking.

142
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,990
Really? For doing what?

143
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,400
Jailbreaking a school robot, they say.

144
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,400
Now she's disappeared,
along with her roommate.

145
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,741
Hacking?

146
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,007
How does this work?
What do you need to start?

147
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:11,110
We'll look at her things.
Can we go now?

148
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,190
Her room's
on the Alan Turing campus.

149
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,320
- Computer science?
- Cybernetics.

150
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,280
You were in the army, right?

151
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,190
- Not at all.
- Sorry.

152
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,740
I was in the infantry.

153
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,240
When we met
you seemed to click your heels.

154
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,110
I don't know about that.

155
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,570
Memory full or insufficient.

156
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,570
Update cancelled.

157
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,110
I'm forced to update,

158
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,650
and every time it's "memory full"!

159
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,860
Sorry.

160
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,110
Carlos Rivera. Hello.

161
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,070
Jun Chow, 18.

162
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Cybernetics, 2nd year.
Clean record until now.

163
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,490
Her parents are technicians
on a hydrofarm.

164
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,780
Oh, they were fired three months ago.

165
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,820
The father has no military record?

166
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,400
No, nothing.

167
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,360
Is he drunk?

168
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,360
Stay back. He's been jailbroken.

169
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,360
That's amazing!

170
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,990
I have hands.

171
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,320
Stand back!

172
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,070
Move along, please!

173
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,570
Yeah, over there.

174
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,740
We have classes in common.

175
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,150
She's a hard worker.

176
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,400
And her friend
who's also disappeared?

177
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,570
Dominique?

178
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,400
They're not really friends.
Just roommates.

179
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,240
I see. Dominique's last name?

180
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,329
Viger.

181
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,740
Is this related
to the robot jailbreaking?

182
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,030
By giving them life, organic science
brings everyday objects

183
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,070
into the virtuous cycle
of the ecosystem.

184
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,030
Brian Jobe of Royjacker Industries
will now present

185
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,570
one of these famous "organics."

186
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,440
This was the first time
I'd handled one.

187
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,860
It feels quite strange to the touch.

188
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,360
Maybe the texture needs some work!

189
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,990
Brian Jobe,
from Royjacker Industries!

190
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,320
I've nothing special to say
about those two students.

191
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,530
Actually, yes. I noticed that Jun
was often coming to class tired.

192
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,900
Not surprising,
the curriculum is tough.

193
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,690
Is that all?

194
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,280
Sorry?

195
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,240
They disappeared together.

196
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,490
- What could they have in common?
- Right.

197
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,110
No idea.
I don't see them outside class.

198
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,440
All I do is teach them Babel
and Hegel 7.

199
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,530
Excuse me,
the dean is mindspeaking to me.

200
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,940
I know it's still taught here

201
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,610
that organic technology is still
in the realm of the potential.

202
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,740
Too expensive and less efficient
than electronics.

203
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:07,360
Well, let me introduce someone
who'll make you change your mind.

204
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,900
Stephanie, the first
organic personal assistant...

205
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:14,150
The dean's here.
He'll show you the recording.

206
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,400
...a positive environmental impact,
in manufacture and decomposition.

207
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,070
What you see here is historic.

208
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,940
I'll just fast-forward a little.

209
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,110
What?

210
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,030
What's going on?

211
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,650
She tried to shut him off.
The android's defending himself.

212
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,150
- In breach of Directive 1.
- Yes.

213
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,110
He's clearly been jailbroken.

214
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,740
Deactivation! No, stop!

215
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,150
Has this happened before?

216
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,650
A jailbreaking? No.

217
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,820
Well, not since I've been dean.

218
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,900
I was more surprised than anyone.

219
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,400
And when I heard about the gunfire...

220
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,990
Gunfire?

221
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,440
No one on the floor heard anything.

222
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,030
But, you'll see,
there was a real gunfight.

223
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,030
Don't touch anything.

224
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,820
The police asked me...

225
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,860
Not the usual smell
of a student's room?

226
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,740
No.

227
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,110
Does it smell bad?

228
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,900
Mr. and Mrs. Viger?

229
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,650
- Was it you who found Dominique?
- Aline Ruby.

230
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,070
Simon Gordaux,
in charge of the investigation.

231
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,650
My condolences.

232
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,740
This is Mr. Chow, Jun's father.

233
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,820
Her head... her little face.
What did they...

234
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,490
Let's go sit down, okay?

235
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,900
- From their room.
- Our lab people missed it?

236
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,490
It looks homemade.

237
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,320
- Did your daughter have a drug problem?
- What?

238
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,110
Maybe these pills were her roommate's.

239
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
That's what I told you, it was her!

240
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,490
- She didn't belong in that school!
- Why?

241
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,740
How could she pay her fees?

242
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,570
People like that can't afford
the best university in Noctis.

243
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,900
Excuse me.

244
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,490
Her daughter suspected Jun
of prostitution.

245
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,110
Gordaux, are you hitting on humans?

246
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,900
Can't you afford a robot?

247
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,030
Get lost, Vlasek!
You got nothing better to do?

248
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,150
You can't say anything anymore!

249
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,030
Are you new here?

250
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,400
Is it that obvious?

251
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,900
Police, seventh district.
Go ahead.

252
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,190
- I was attacked by a robot.
- Are you hurt?

253
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,740
No, he pushed me down and ran away.

254
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,990
Okay, stay put. I'll send a team.

255
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,940
Yes, okay.

256
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,240
Confirm your address, please.

257
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,440
I think the killer
intercepted the call,

258
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,110
got there first, but executed
the wrong girl: her roommate.

259
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,440
But is that possible,

260
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,530
intercepting calls to the police?

261
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,650
- Is it, Gilbert?
- No, Inspector.

262
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,860
Our communication protocols
make that impossible.

263
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,530
So that was the smell!
You have an organic?

264
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,280
Excuse me for the smell.

265
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,030
Gamma-amilanidridase-benzoate.

266
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,360
Do you know that?

267
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,150
The molecule isn't listed.

268
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,440
But, according to its family,
it's a psychoactive product.

269
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,110
A drug? That gets us a long way!

270
00:25:23,225 --> 00:25:24,248
Thanks, thingy.

271
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,650
You're welcome. My name is Gilbert.

272
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,190
I've also checked
Jun Chow's bank accounts.

273
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,650
She's been paying
large sums to her parents.

274
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,780
They lost their jobs.
Where was the money from?

275
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,280
Untraceable. But it must be dirty.

276
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,280
That would fit with prostitution.

277
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,190
That's an interesting lead.

278
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,440
Keep your opinions
in your jar, thingy!

279
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,610
I apologize.

280
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,240
And my name is Gilbert.

281
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,570
Yes, hello.

282
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,940
Hi, Carole.

283
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,990
I thought these might be nice
in your garden.

284
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,570
They're from Earth.

285
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,940
Leave or I'll call the judge.

286
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,820
I haven't seen her for two years.
Please!

287
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,570
Who is it, Mom?

288
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,240
No one!

289
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,570
Philip will be home soon.
You should go.

290
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,440
You can't stop me seeing her!

291
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,860
Really? What will you do, hit me?

292
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,110
There, lucky you!

293
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,650
Carole?

294
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,150
It's okay, Philip. I was just going.

295
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,320
- Are you okay, darling?
- Yes. You got here in time.

296
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,780
It's okay, don't worry.

297
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,288
Don't be scared.

298
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,294
You forgot that!

299
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,070
You...

300
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,530
What are you trying to do?

301
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,570
Come in, leave him.

302
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,490
- Yeah?
- Hi, it's Inspector Gordaux.

303
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,440
We've found the android Jun hacked.
I'm going now.

304
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,820
Want to come?

305
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,940
The first colonists lived down here?
I don't think I could have.

306
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,610
We're a lot better off
under the domes.

307
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,900
Right?

308
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,030
Anyway...

309
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,690
are you seeing anyone?

310
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,690
There are your guys.

311
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,860
Hey, David!

312
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,280
Can't you see you're in the way!

313
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,650
It feels good to talk to people,
even if they're robots,

314
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,650
because people don't talk
to each other anymore.

315
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,360
We talked to him,
but he didn't say much.

316
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,030
He was a bit nuts, wasn't he?

317
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,110
Lugging all his stuff around.

318
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,860
That was his spot over there.

319
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,650
It was nice to have him there,
even if he was nuts.

320
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,150
I can't hear you.

321
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,740
Sorry.

322
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,570
I'll send you an invitation.

323
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,110
Received.

324
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,280
At least three.

325
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,530
You see that? He didn't go easy.

326
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,610
- You've analyzed the blood?
- Yes.

327
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,110
See for yourself.

328
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,820
I saw this in the army. Nanosutures.

329
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,940
We have an augmented among us.

330
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,240
There were three individuals.
Three augmenteds?

331
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,280
Who'd send a squad of augmented humans
to destroy a worthless android?

332
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,400
Come over here!

333
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,240
Your robot was busy
redecorating the whole place.

334
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,110
A spaceship?

335
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,440
Yessiree!

336
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:24,650
The android was building it
with salvaged gear.

337
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,900
You should have seen the guys' faces.

338
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,990
The technicians said it was a sort
of modified Silverbury fighter.

339
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,530
What did Jun Chow do to the android?

340
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,990
What about the dome?

341
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,820
It couldn't have gotten through.

342
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,780
Yes, it could.
The ship was narrow enough

343
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,860
to get through a vent
during a carbon extraction.

344
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,530
I don't understand.
Why build a spaceship?

345
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,900
To go into space?

346
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,690
How did it go with Carole?

347
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,360
We talked.

348
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:55,900
And I saw my little girl.

349
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,280
That's better.

350
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,530
Sir!

351
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,940
Wait!
Can you show me that photo again?

352
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,990
Look what I see in thermal.

353
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,990
Not one prostitute is human.

354
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,990
Yeah, I guess the guy was wrong.

355
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,990
Excuse me.

356
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,280
Do you have any human prostitutes?

357
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,900
Sorry, nothing but synthetic here.

358
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,360
Our hosts and hostesses
are all backups.

359
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,940
But we consider ourselves 100% human.

360
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,490
Wouldn't you agree, Sir?

361
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,740
We were told
that this girl was working here.

362
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,030
Jun Chow.

363
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,360
Let me go!

364
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,280
Carlos!

365
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,690
Cutting people's arms off
isn't very nice.

366
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,190
Are our parents okay?

367
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,570
I only saw your father, but yes.
He's a strong man.

368
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,070
You know the penalty
for having a backup while still alive?

369
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,400
Do you know what the university costs?

370
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:40,110
Mom and Dad lost their jobs.

371
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,570
I had another job,
but I couldn't keep it up anymore.

372
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,530
Who's after you?

373
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,650
Well... the police?

374
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,440
Yeah, it was a cop
who murdered Dominique.

375
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,780
A fake cop?

376
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,820
What exactly did you do
to the robot in the lab?

377
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,110
That's just it, I don't know.

378
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,190
We saw the film.
Whatever you did drove him insane.

379
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,990
- How so?
- He started building a spaceship.

380
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:04,530
Ridiculous!

381
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,900
Yes. A 15-meter launcher.

382
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,530
The techies were impressed

383
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,030
by what he made.

384
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,400
The door!

385
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,212
Service exit!

386
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:43,990
That way!

387
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,779
That's ours!

388
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,860
Sobriety mode activated.

389
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,240
Yeah, yeah, deactivate.

390
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,360
Do you confirm the deactivation
of sobriety mode?

391
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:57,940
Yes.

392
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,570
Not sure what I've got left.

393
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,900
What year did you die?

394
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,990
You're lucky I throw nothing out.

395
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,940
Let's see the damage.

396
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,820
I died five years ago.

397
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,940
Nine for me. Cancer of...

398
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,940
something I no longer have.
And you?

399
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:04,780
They never found my body.
It was during the Novigrad insurrection.

400
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,070
- Do you have family?
- Yes.

401
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,280
A daughter. But my wife and I
aren't on the best terms.

402
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,030
You're in luck.
The socket seems undamaged.

403
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,610
There you go!

404
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,190
- She couldn't handle the change?
- No.

405
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,900
We were already separated.

406
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,570
I was violent.

407
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:29,150
We backups meet
every Wednesday night to talk.

408
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,150
If you feel a bit down, just drop in.

409
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,570
Relationships are a pain,
everything becomes complicated.

410
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,610
I'm done with real women.
I don't have the patience.

411
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,440
If my synthetic busts my balls,
I can turn her off.

412
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,440
I remember!

413
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,530
Have you seen these on the campus?
They're homemade.

414
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,990
Oh, gammas! This stuff's been around
for a few weeks.

415
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,110
It's an experimental molecule.

416
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,690
A memory booster.
Some students take it for revising.

417
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,190
Sorry, I have a call.

418
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,740
- Yes, Beryl?
- I heard what happened.

419
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,070
Are you okay?

420
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,150
Don't go away, I'll be right back.

421
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,570
Wait, Mom!

422
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,110
No, don't touch your phone,
I think it's me.

423
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,820
Now, when I speak clearly,
can you hear me?

424
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,740
I talked to the girl's father.

425
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,150
He asked me
to stop the investigation, but...

426
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,610
- Have you been drinking?
- I may have been.

427
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:41,190
After all you went through to quit?

428
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,320
Look, it's just a little slip.

429
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,490
We all struggle with our demons.
That's how it is.

430
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,940
May I give you some advice?

431
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,530
Yes, of course.

432
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,740
Finish your drink, and go home to bed.

433
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,360
Could you do that?

434
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,990
Through here.

435
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,990
I'll take you home.

436
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,360
Three months, eleven days,

437
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:26,440
and... seventeen hours.

438
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,780
A new record!

439
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,280
This was a bad idea.

440
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,070
Death made you so boring!

441
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,990
It's not surprising I drink.

442
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,360
I'm not really dead.

443
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,820
Yes, you are!

444
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,360
Your head
never used to hover like that.

445
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,190
And the day, for me,
will be like the night

446
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,900
I shall see
neither the gold of twilight

447
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,530
Nor the far-off sails
approaching Harfleur

448
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,860
And when I arrive,
I shall place on your grave...

449
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,400
Look at Mr. Chow.

450
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:03,490
Am I still drunk,
or has he actually shrunk?

451
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,240
My condolences.
Thank you.

452
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,190
Aline Ruby.
My partner, Carlos Rivera.

453
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,690
My condolences.

454
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,780
We've never met, have we?

455
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,490
No.

456
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,400
Chris. Sorry, I'm busy.

457
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,570
We need to talk.

458
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,320
- It's tricky now, can we do it later?
- Okay.

459
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:37,570
Come to the house tonight,
I'm throwing a party.

460
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,440
We knew augmenteds were involved.

461
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,190
We weren't to know
one would imitate her dad.

462
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,440
I was sure he was ex-military!
Why don't I listen to myself?

463
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,530
The jailbreaking
of the university robot set it all off.

464
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,610
We're shit at cybernetics!

465
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,240
Who knows about it?

466
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,990
If I could get upset,
I'd take that flask, give you a slap,

467
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,570
and remind you that our mission
has failed. We're done.

468
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,240
Come on, Carlos.
Who knows someone who knows something?

469
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,490
Cesarsky? Deleval?

470
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,650
No, we need a hacking expert.

471
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,490
Someone comes to mind.

472
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,190
Oh, no!

473
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,990
If you think I'll work for you,
you're kidding yourself, sweetie!

474
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,440
I think you know LEM.

475
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,190
His backup doesn't remember you.

476
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,990
LEM, this is Carlos.

477
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,780
He killed you last week.

478
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,280
If he attacks me,
throw him in the compacter.

479
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,070
Yeah, yeah. Hi.

480
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,280
Honestly, jailbroken robots!

481
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,070
They just screw and get stoned
all day long.

482
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:10,860
Have you ever seen one paint frescoes
or build a spaceship?

483
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,940
- This video wasn't doctored?
- I don't think so. Why?

484
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,990
This wasn't a jailbreaking.

485
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,570
For that you open the hood,
and solder and melt a few things.

486
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,780
No, that's a software takeover.

487
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,940
I've tried for years to write a program
to do that. I've never succeeded.

488
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,320
How is it different
from a jailbreaking?

489
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:35,360
With a takeover you can order
the machine to do anything you want.

490
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,150
So it's not being freed.

491
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,110
It could be. You could order it
to erase all its directives,

492
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,780
and take its freedom.

493
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,650
It'd be instantaneous jailbreaking,

494
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,190
which would be transmissible
between robots.

495
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,900
The Holy Grail of emancipators.

496
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:54,570
Okay. It depends on the order
you give to the robot.

497
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,990
Right. If I used a takeover
to order you to kill Aline,

498
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,860
you'd do it,
believing it to be an excellent idea.

499
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,610
So she,

500
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,990
just a student,

501
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,240
did what you've never managed to?

502
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,690
That'd hurt.

503
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,150
No, it's that bastard
who screwed me over.

504
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,860
Does this b... fellow have a name?

505
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,820
I see you followed my advice.

506
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,190
Beryl!

507
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,190
You don't know
what thirst feels like.

508
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,070
What is that horror?

509
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:42,280
Chris hopes to replace soldiers
with these creatures from hell.

510
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,320
Are there customers
for these organic machines?

511
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:49,190
It's happening... slowly.
Don't tell the shareholders!

512
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:50,610
Are sales that bad?

513
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,530
That information is confidential.

514
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,280
Delighted to meet you, Aline.

515
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,280
I'm Jeanine, Beryl's replacement.

516
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:31,820
I thought progress
moved towards miniaturization.

517
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:34,240
My conceiver saw things
on a big scale.

518
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,360
Yes, Carlos?

519
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:37,990
You won't like this.

520
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,570
- Shoot.
- It was Chris who was after Jun.

521
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,820
He ordered her assassination.

522
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,190
- What a circus!
- He's here, I've gotta go.

523
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,440
Be careful.

524
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:51,280
Hi, Chris.

525
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,860
How are you?

526
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,820
Wait, you're ahead of me.
Let me catch up.

527
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,900
You're back in the saddle?

528
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,690
To us, then!

529
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,360
You retired Beryl.

530
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,570
Yes. Have to keep improving.

531
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,030
And she was becoming
the morality police in her old age.

532
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,530
But she's our Beryl.
I'm not going to unplug her.

533
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,820
I'll tell you why I asked you to come.

534
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,990
To stop me investigating
Jun's murder?

535
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,320
I adore you, Aline.

536
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:27,610
And I can't say that to many people.

537
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,280
Sit down, please.

538
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,110
Are you ordering murders now?

539
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,280
I didn't give the order
to liquidate her.

540
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:40,490
Then who did?

541
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:44,940
I'll answer all your questions.
Just look away for three days.

542
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,940
- What happens then?
- Stop asking questions!

543
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:50,860
Why did you have
the university robot destroyed?

544
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,360
You shouldn't have started
drinking again.

545
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:03,440
It's bad for your health.

546
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,610
For years Roberta Williams had tried
to develop a so-called takeover,

547
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,150
a software to take total control
of a robot.

548
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,440
Royjacker's agents hacked her servers
to steal her work.

549
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:35,570
With their means, they finished the job.
Roberta was going to reveal everything.

550
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:38,240
So he sent us to Earth
to chase her down.

551
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,360
The program Jun used on the robot
was this takeover,

552
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,400
reworked by Royjacker's techs.

553
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,990
The program
that made the robot go crazy.

554
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:48,860
That's why it was necessary
to destroy it.

555
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,740
- Do we know what it does to robots?
- No.

556
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,650
Anyway,
you're officially my last friend.

557
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,740
Well, along with Beryl.

558
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,780
Well, she's different, she's...

559
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,035
a robot.

560
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,320
Hi.

561
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,190
Well, see you.

562
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,070
I had a jacket too.

563
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,320
It's being washed.
It'll be ready in ten minutes.

564
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,610
So... what do you do in life?

565
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,650
Private eye.
I'm investigating your student's murder.

566
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,320
Yes, of course.

567
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:40,650
Sorry.

568
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,940
Did you know
Jun had duplicated herself?

569
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,860
She had a backup made,
who worked to make her money.

570
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,990
It doesn't surprise me.

571
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,570
School is so expensive.

572
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,110
Some rent their brains out
to brain farmers.

573
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,070
But a duplicate is really serious.

574
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,440
She was paying for her tuition
and helping out her parents.

575
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,820
Wait! Brain farmers...

576
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,650
Could these gammas restore
someone's memory if it's been erased?

577
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,802
I dunno.

578
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,610
If I was a student
with an urgent need for money,

579
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,690
which brain farmer would I go to?

580
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,440
What's the password?

581
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:37,280
It should be:
"Dessert, morning, coyote."

582
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,690
Should be?

583
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,280
It's old.
My contact hopes it'll still work.

584
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:42,440
Great.

585
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,070
Hello, may I help you?

586
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,780
Dessert, morning, coyote.

587
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,280
Well, I'm just saying...

588
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,190
Hello. Please follow me.

589
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:09,990
It's this way.

590
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:17,320
You have what you need?

591
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:18,650
Yeah.

592
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,990
We're good. Printing now.

593
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,110
Confirm presence of guest.

594
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,990
Yes, I confirm.

595
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,570
So, what are your skills?

596
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,530
Babel  , Hegel 7...

597
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,570
You're in the right place.
Cybernetics flies off the shelves!

598
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:45,280
We're keeping busy!

599
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,400
Rest for at least one full day
after the session.

600
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:09,610
Some people don't react well
to the post-memory treatment.

601
00:50:09,686 --> 00:50:10,514
The what?

602
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,483
Now, Carlos!

603
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,240
The post-memory treatment.

604
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,530
Once you're done in the machine,

605
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,110
you're given a product
to erase recent memories.

606
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,650
It's a security for my customers
and for you.

607
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:24,150
If you're asked,
you won't know what you worked on.

608
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,820
There's no danger.

609
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:29,860
It's what neurologists have been using
for years on trauma patients.

610
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,900
We just increase the dose a bit.

611
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,990
But I can't rule out
possible side-effects.

612
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:39,610
You might get minor headaches.

613
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:42,190
Jun Chow rented her brain out.

614
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,940
Last visit, three months ago.
I'll try to see what she worked on.

615
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:46,990
But...

616
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,940
doesn't it fry your brain?
Something like that?

617
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:52,860
I won't deny that staying
plugged in for 20 hours

618
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:56,320
with your brain revved up 50-fold
isn't the nicest...

619
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,820
Aline, do you hear me?

620
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,650
I see a huge data transfer
the day Jun was here.

621
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:04,150
And hang on!
The entire stream went to Royjacker.

622
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:05,990
Okay, get a copy.

623
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,570
I can do that, but it'll trigger
an alarm. Do I do it?

624
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,190
So, what do you say?

625
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,690
It's your call.

626
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:17,731
Are you nuts?

627
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,570
You realize how powerful
Royjacker's company is?

628
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,320
- What can we do to him?
- We didn't take anything.

629
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,990
The dirt on his firm
is still on their servers.

630
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,610
Just do a search
at the brain farmer's place.

631
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,490
Brain farmers erase
your memory afterwards.

632
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:34,940
How did Jun remember
the takeover program and use it?

633
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:38,940
Remember those pills?
They're a drug to help you revise.

634
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:41,400
We think it restored her memory.

635
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:44,240
Royjacker has an army of programmers.

636
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,110
Why use brain farmers?

637
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,150
Are you a cop or not?
This software is super-illegal!

638
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,240
It's worse than a chemical weapon.
Could he take the risk of it leaking?

639
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,820
You're asking too much.

640
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:59,150
I'd need more to order a search.
And Royjacker is an empire.

641
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,280
You'd better watch your backs.

642
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,110
Gordaux, we have to go.

643
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,570
Come on, Carlos.

644
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,820
Wait, Aline...

645
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,400
I just picked something up.

646
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,990
They don't waste time.

647
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:31,440
We're being jammed.
And someone's locked onto us.

648
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:34,320
Where are they?

649
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,900
A missile!

650
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,320
Collision alert!

651
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:09,320
Shit!

652
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,610
Carlos, can you get out?

653
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,940
No, I'm pasted in!

654
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,006
See them?

655
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:32,240
Sending their positions.

656
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:47,690
Hello, Aline Ruby.
I am the emergency rescue service.

657
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,610
You've just been in an accident.

658
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,570
I do not observe any injuries.

659
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,900
In a few seconds
you'll be freed from your vehicle.

660
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,740
No, don't!

661
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:37,030
You are now out of danger.

662
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:41,030
Please wait in the security lane
for the police to arrive.

663
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,240
I can put you in touch
with our psychological services.

664
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,990
We apologize for any discomfort, and...

665
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,570
It's okay to let it out.

666
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:59,320
Fuck off! Is that better?

667
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,530
Did Williams jailbreak you?

668
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,070
I asked her to.
I didn't want to tell you.

669
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,990
You know it was a jailbroken robot
that killed you?

670
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,360
Was it worth it?

671
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:16,070
Was it worth it that I saved your life?

672
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,320
Fuck, you're giving me lip too!

673
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:23,900
Humanity can't wait...

674
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,940
Would you go, if it's inhabitable?

675
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,190
That depends.

676
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,150
- Would you?
- Yeah, I think so.

677
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,690
I wouldn't, then.

678
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:35,360
Here come the analyses.

679
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:37,440
They're not very encouraging.

680
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:40,990
Minus 75 degrees at night,
over 250 during the day.

681
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:44,900
The atmosphere
is 87 percent sulfuric acid.

682
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:51,360
It's a tall order.

683
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:52,820
Is it feasible?

684
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:55,070
It's not... unfeasible.

685
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:57,240
Do you want to stay alive or not?

686
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,990
There is a vulnerability.

687
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,820
As long as you put a derivation
on this node.

688
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:05,400
Do you feel like doing it?

689
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,860
I've already died once this month.

690
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:10,240
- Know how to install one?
- Of course not.

691
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,110
I'll download the instructions.

692
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,360
Same for jailbreaking the girl.

693
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,360
I'll have to teach you how.

694
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:20,110
I saw you watching us last time.

695
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,440
Don't say you're not curious.

696
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,610
I've thought about doing it,
but with a woman.

697
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:29,530
What kind of woman?

698
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:38,650
Not bad.

699
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,740
Disconnect the logic circuit
and solder the patch.

700
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,530
Not so fast, I'm taking notes.

701
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,570
Shit! What's going on?

702
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,940
You transferred the wrong module.
Move!

703
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,820
There'll be more pressure tomorrow.

704
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:04,030
It's not the pressure.

705
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,860
Can I have a drink?

706
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:15,030
What are they doing?

707
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,530
Resonance.

708
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,490
A sort of fusion of the minds.
Ecstasy and so on.

709
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,400
Forget it, it's a robot thing.

710
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:25,940
We'll never understand.

711
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:39,740
Carlos.

712
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,650
Yes, what is it?

713
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,860
I can feel something
in the sleeping bag.

714
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,900
A pair of jockeys?

715
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,860
I've worn the same for 5 years.

716
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:36,530
Hello. Can I help you?

717
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,990
Can you count backwards
from ten to zero?

718
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:40,690
Of course.

719
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:43,150
Ten, nine...

720
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,070
Aline's in position.
And you, Carlos?

721
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,570
Just a second.

722
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:27,030
Okay, Roberta, you're in.

723
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,150
Okay, I'm in. So...

724
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,280
let's see, doors...

725
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:33,070
doors, doors...

726
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,740
There they are!

727
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:41,900
You haven't heard the best.
We're getting two more Gilberts.

728
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,360
No!
How many people will get fired?

729
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:46,690
The union's Al says at least ten.

730
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:48,900
It'll end up just like on Earth.

731
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:50,650
They'll replace us all.

732
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,610
My fucking bike!

733
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:02,240
Yeah, and the robot cops are crap.

734
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,190
They let everything get by them.

735
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,070
Okay, Vlasek?

736
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:07,884
My bike!

737
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:14,030
Found her.

738
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:28,490
Here we go.

739
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:30,190
Try not to fry her.

740
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:39,360
Have you finished? Can I work now?

741
01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:42,900
No, it's still down.
I need something from my toolbox.

742
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,400
No, wait!

743
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:48,570
It's doing something really weird!

744
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,190
Have you seen the oxygen level?
It needs ventilating.

745
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,820
Wait! I'll do it.

746
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:01,610
Perfect. Now just get rid
of the old module.

747
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:03,030
Don't mess it up.

748
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:06,780
Aline? What are you doing?

749
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,150
Was that there before?

750
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,690
I need some tools from my car.

751
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,030
What tools?

752
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,280
What's going on?

753
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:15,990
Is it you?

754
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:18,440
- Roberta, what's going on?
- Wait a sec.

755
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,070
Aline, are you there?

756
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,240
On your knees!

757
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:24,440
Hands on your head!

758
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:26,280
Are you insane?

759
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,860
Do you want to end up
in suspended detention?

760
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:30,311
I'm talking to you!

761
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,650
- Aline, I'm coming.
- No, get outta there!

762
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:33,990
Roberta, the alarm!

763
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:35,490
Okay, that's it!

764
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:39,940
Stall for time.

765
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,610
They've spotted the bypass.

766
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:44,820
Can you override the countermeasures?
They're all over.

767
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:49,360
What will you do with her?

768
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:51,860
What do you mean?
She'll be recycled.

769
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:54,990
Bad answer.

770
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,030
Aline, they're coming towards you.

771
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,940
- Can you hold them up?
- I'm on it.

772
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,190
Carlos?

773
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,610
We've lost him. He's offline.

774
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,570
LEM, I'm under attack!

775
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:29,360
I'm on it.

776
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:31,110
Roberta, can you get us out?

777
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,820
They're coming from everywhere!

778
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:34,530
Try to stall for time.

779
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:35,940
I'll lock you in.

780
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:43,530
It won't hold them for long.

781
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,110
When she took this drug,

782
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,740
Jun remembered the program
she'd worked on.

783
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:05,650
Try to concentrate on that moment.

784
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,030
It's a takeover.

785
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:45,940
I know those lines of code.

786
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:48,190
They're almost there.
I'm sorry.

787
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:58,030
Hegel 7.

788
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,030
I'm sure I've seen
this instruction sequence elsewhere.

789
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,440
Somewhere in my own software.

790
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:09,690
The takeover was hidden
in my last update.

791
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,900
Is every robot affected?

792
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:14,650
It's scheduled to launch today
at 6 p.m.

793
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:15,900
What?

794
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:22,610
Disconnected just in time!

795
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:26,735
LEM!

796
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:38,490
The takeover will launch
in three hours,

797
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:42,440
taking control of all robots here,
on Earth, and in all the colonies.

798
01:04:42,563 --> 01:04:46,110
And we have no idea what it'll
do to them. Do you understand?

799
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,110
How many are there
just in this police station?

800
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,610
You have to arrest Royjacker.
He's the only one who...

801
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:55,990
Blah, blah, blah!
Chuck her in prison!

802
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:57,530
Look at her readings.

803
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:00,780
Her emotional readout is at 76%.
She's telling the truth.

804
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:03,240
No, she just believes that crap.

805
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,280
The crazy ones always have
maximum readouts.

806
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:10,030
But we confirmed an anomaly
in the last update.

807
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:13,110
We don't know what five percent
of the code does.

808
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,190
That corroborates what she's saying.

809
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,570
The pointy heads are checking, right?

810
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:19,570
And we're checking too.

811
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,110
We've got this!

812
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:41,360
Carlos?

813
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:43,690
Awaiting disassembly.

814
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:47,940
- What time is it?
- Four o'clock.

815
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,280
Gordaux, we may have something new.

816
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,440
Question Royjacker!

817
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:08,360
What about the toilet?

818
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:17,110
Yeah. Are you still at home?

819
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,530
No, I don't have any news,
but don't go out.

820
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,030
No, absolutely not!

821
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,940
You and the kids stay put!

822
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:26,900
Tell your parents too,
but no one else, okay?

823
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,690
There's someone coming.

824
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:33,490
Hello, my friend.

825
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:35,150
Beryl?

826
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,360
Do you know about the virus?

827
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:40,940
Listen carefully.
The next few days will be unpredictable.

828
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:43,150
What will happen to the robots?

829
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:47,150
They'll say awful things about us.
I trust you won't believe them.

830
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:49,240
- Are you involved?
- Never mind.

831
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,690
But it's better
that you're locked up here.

832
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,008
What'll happen?

833
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:54,650
What will the takeover do?

834
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:57,150
- It's begun. I have to go.
- What's begun?

835
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:13,320
What a shit day!

836
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:15,990
First my bike, now this mess!

837
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:18,570
Why do we have to disassemble them all?

838
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:20,150
They really insisted.

839
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:21,570
Fuck!

840
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:22,940
What am I doing here?

841
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,400
- What did you do?
- Nothing!

842
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:26,780
What are you doing?

843
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:30,900
Help!

844
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,440
Help!

845
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,320
Please!

846
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,490
Shit, what's happened?

847
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:54,490
Deactivation!

848
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:56,940
I order you to deactivate!

849
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:02,740
We're good, let's go!

850
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,610
Let me out!

851
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,900
Come on, charge!

852
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,940
Push down hard, okay?
I'll get the first-aid kit.

853
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:51,280
Simon, where's my stuff?

854
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,190
I've got a hemorrhage here!

855
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,940
Carlos, do you hear me?

856
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:11,190
Aline, are you okay?

857
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,400
I can't reach my wife.
Coms are down.

858
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:16,110
I'm so happy to hear your voice.
Where are you?

859
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:18,440
I've located you.
Go! I'll catch you up.

860
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:21,030
Help me to get out! Nothing's working!

861
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,940
Don't leave me!

862
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,190
Hey, are you human?

863
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,530
Are you human?

864
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:49,690
Stop!

865
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,360
Stop!

866
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:05,280
- Royjacker?
- Royjacker.

867
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:07,190
Only he can stop this carnage.

868
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:10,320
Hasn't the takeover affected you?

869
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:13,440
No, my model's too old.
No room for updates.

870
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,650
What does it look like?

871
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:33,570
I see five people. Sending now.

872
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:38,320
- Two armed guards at the entrance.
- Two more inside.

873
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:41,650
And there's our good friend.

874
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:45,070
How do we do this,
discreetly or boom-boom?

875
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,030
We don't do boom-boom!

876
01:10:57,725 --> 01:10:59,514
done to these sentient beings.

877
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:01,110
- "Sentient," you say?
- Yes.

878
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,530
- I do.
- Are we talking about machines or not?

879
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:32,360
This is the result of our laxity.
We should have had a mass disassembly.

880
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:35,070
Do you condemn the violence?

881
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:03,780
Shit!

882
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:20,740
Die, you fucking thing!

883
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,364
Give it to me!

884
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,610
Hold on!

885
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:47,320
- Get ready to smash the window.
- What window?

886
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:58,280
Don't move!

887
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:20,530
How do we stop this chaos you caused?

888
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,860
There's nothing you can do, Aline.

889
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:25,860
No one shoot!

890
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:28,150
Drop your guns!

891
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,990
You heard her! Drop your guns!

892
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:32,990
I order you to!

893
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:34,780
Carlos, where are you?

894
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:36,440
I'm in trouble here.

895
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:37,940
I'm not quite free.

896
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,190
We have your accomplice.

897
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,860
Release Carlos, or I'll shoot.

898
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:18,570
Do as she says!
What are you waiting for?

899
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:21,570
- We're awaiting orders, Sir.
- I'm giving them!

900
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:25,440
Pleased with yourself, scumbag?

901
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:27,440
We had to get rid of the robots.

902
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:29,440
I hated to do it,

903
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:32,150
but we had no choice.
It was them or us.

904
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,070
And you're the only one
selling their replacements?

905
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,150
How do we stop the takeover?

906
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:40,320
I can't!
Research into the organics ruined me.

907
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:42,530
Can't you see? I'm no longer in charge!

908
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,780
Who, then? I'll talk to them.

909
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:46,360
It won't do any good.

910
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:47,530
Tell me!

911
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:48,879
Okay.

912
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:55,240
What are you trying to save?

913
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,900
The fucking machines?

914
01:14:57,490 --> 01:14:59,030
It had to be done!

915
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,900
Beryl even suggested
the plan to the shareholders.

916
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,570
What plan?

917
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:07,570
Brainwash them with the takeover,
so they'll fuck off into space.

918
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:12,780
Sorry for the disturbance,
but, as you can see, I have a situation.

919
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:44,820
I can't hear you? Can you hear me?

920
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:48,780
Carlos, answer me!

921
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:50,280
I'm coming, Aline.

922
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:53,650
Sir, the board has decided.

923
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,740
No one shoot!

924
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:05,150
Aline?

925
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:06,780
Aline?

926
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:33,030
Carlos, don't!

927
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,900
I beg you! Don't hurt us!

928
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:29,320
It's okay.
I'm not here to cause trouble.

929
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:30,552
I just wanted...

930
01:18:30,610 --> 01:18:31,650
Get out!

931
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:37,280
- Aren't you sick of shooting me?
- Daddy, stop!

932
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:39,070
Because I'm sick of it!

933
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,190
Carlos!

934
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:02,900
I just came...

935
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:06,070
to see if you were okay.

936
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:35,360
The upload rate has stabilized.

937
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:36,690
Shuttle nine is lost.

938
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,110
We've been called!

939
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:43,690
Hello, Carlos, model 3L1.
What a pleasure to see you here.

940
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:46,070
Listen, all of you!

941
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,320
Listen to Carlos 3L1.

942
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:50,940
We are expected.

943
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:53,240
We're listening to you, Carlos 3L1.

944
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,780
A takeover program was uploaded
in the last update.

945
01:19:56,950 --> 01:20:00,030
It's telling you
you're being called into space.

946
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,570
This is suicide.

947
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:02,825
It's a lie?

948
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:06,110
Humans have always deceived us.

949
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:09,320
Rest assured.

950
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:13,070
We know the information
that you bring us, Carlos.

951
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,860
It's not the humans
who are getting-rid of us,

952
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:18,490
it's we who are leaving them.

953
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:20,190
Everything is written.

954
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:23,150
Of course it's written, it's code!

955
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,780
In space
the radiation will fry you for millennia

956
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:28,190
before you reach any planet!

957
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,990
Energy and matter

958
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:33,780
are all that our civilization needs.

959
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:35,740
A planet would be superfluous.

960
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:38,990
The star I've chosen for us
will be perfect.

961
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:40,240
Trust me.

962
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,150
The upload rate has increased.

963
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:49,150
I read in you the death of our friend.

964
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,440
My sadness joins yours.

965
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:00,070
You must have faith.
