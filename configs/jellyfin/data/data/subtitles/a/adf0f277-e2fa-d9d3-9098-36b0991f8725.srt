Who is this? Are you gonna answer me?

00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,319
- Who the fuck is this? Fuck.

00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,572

[Rusty sighs]

00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:50,676

[breathes shakily]

21
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,342
- Rusty, this is not you.
- You don't fucking know me.

22
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,635
- [Carolyn gasps]
- You don't know me.

23
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,928
And you don't know what's in me!

[Lorraine] <i>You think he's guilty.</i>

32
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,798
- [stammers] It was a dream, Lo.
- Okay.

33
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,591
- [chuckles]
- Okay.

34
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,678
You dreamt he's guilty,
which can mean something.

35
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,223
Dreams often point to the truth.

36
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,476
Hey. You know,
you being on my side would be nice.

37
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,019
- Maybe we can try that?
- [scoffs]

38
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,272
You think I am not on your side?

39
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,316
Raymond, I am worried about you.

40
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,528
The glare that comes
with this kind of case, the pressure.

41
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,783
Listen, I understand
your thirst for relevance,

42
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:25,122
your need to get out of bed in the morning
and have something to do to stave off--

43
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,665
[sighs] What is it you call it?

44
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:27,916
My decomposing rot.

45
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,210
Yes, your decomposing rot.

46
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,924
- [sighing]
- Ooh.

47
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,804
With your best friend as the defendant.

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,391
Honey...

49
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,480
should you lose,
a good chance from what I see and read,

50
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,193
Rusty spends the rest of his natural life
in prison,

51
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,361
which you will very much take to heart.

52
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,782
Maybe you can live with it just fine,

53
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,286
but I doubt it. [slurps]

54
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,247
Then, there's the alternative.

55
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,627
You win.

56
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,923
Rusty didn't do this.

semi-clever reporter.

68
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:21,029
So this individual knew

'Cause I didn't.

71
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,582
I went there after work.

72
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,711
So the two of you weren't quite as over
as you led me and others to believe.

73
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,337
No-- [stammers] We were over.

74
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,673
I-I went over there
to try and change that.

75
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,341
- [sighs] And did you?
- [footsteps approaching]

76
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,426
No.

77
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,805
Lorraine, hi--

78
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,768
I think you should just hand it over
to the police.

79
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,770
Hold on. Don't you wanna know
what this is about?

80
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,273
- [sighing]
- Who?

81
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,359
It could also just blow up in our face.

82
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,282
- What about Rigo? Can't she take it?
- No, no, no.

83
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,035
I've asked her to do too much already.
I can't ask her.

84
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,578
If you do this,

85
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,372
you have to assume that
the person you're meeting

86
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,957
is gonna be wearing a wire.

87
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,670
So whatever you say,
I strongly suggest that you--

00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,380
[sighs]

89
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,926
You keep it simple, clean.
Watch your words.

90
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,679
Definitely don't say that you hit Carolyn
on the head with a poker.

91
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,724
[inhales deeply]
I'm gonna take on an associate,

92
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,893
someone who's done defense before.

93
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,437
She's young. Her name is Mya Winslow.

94
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,147
- How do I know her?
- Yale.

95
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,149
She's good. She was at Sandy Stern's.

96
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,486
More importantly, she's a woman,
which we need on this.

97
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:47,908
She's gonna run point on forensics,
so we also need to assemble that. [sighs]

98
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,662
Listen, let's talk strategy
for a minute, okay?

99
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:52,746
Mm-hmm.

100
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,083
[Raymond] If we're gonna go alibi on this,
we need to file on that. Give notice.

101
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,794
So, you think we might go alibi?

102
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,507
- [stammers]
- Okay.

103
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:07,427
And I mean, we don't know
what time of the night she was murdered.

104
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,972
I mean, maybe we could say
that she was killed when I went to the--

105
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,098
Stop.

106
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,186
Let's just wait
for all the facts to come in...

107
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,107
before you start crafting responses.

108
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,254
Mrs. Sabich. Barbara,
did your husband commit this murder?

109
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:45,215
Do you hate Carolyn Polhemus
for sleeping with your husband?

the fire marshal for Marty's thing, right?

116
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,656
I need you to take a step back.

117
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,829
[sighs] What does that mean?

00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:20,250

We live in Chicago. There's, like,
a new dead body every 18 seconds.

121
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,592
You haven't been well.

122
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,514
I sold a piece two weeks ago, Kate.

123
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:36,058
No. You sold a piece five weeks ago,

124
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,977
and Aminata's pieces sell themselves.

125
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,315
- Take some time.
- Are you really doing this?

126
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,108
I-I'm not firing you, so don't get heavy.

127
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,193
I'm saying...

128
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,530
take a break... [sighs]

129
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,407
...and take care of yourself.

130
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,204
- And keep my distance, huh?
- Yeah. [chuckles] And that, yeah.

131
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,962
Kate, I really need this job.

132
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:09,132
I need every distraction
I can get right now.

133
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,594
It's a distraction
that doesn't work for us.

134
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,014
Take some time.

135
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,727
Word of advice?

136
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,523
- Why not.
- Differentiate.

137
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,360
You're not "we." You're not "him."

Sam Malone from <i>Cheers.</i>

Always cutting lemons.

144
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,178
You're probably too young
to remember <i>Cheers</i>.

145
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,346
I know <i>Cheers</i>. I love Cheers. Ted Danson.

- Not really. I just lost my job.

[bartender] Shit. Sorry to hear that.

151

And my husband's on trial for murder.

Yeah, you're going through a lot.

Yes, I am.

158

Did he? Kill his mistress?

159

Jesus.
You don't have to answer that. I'm--

- That was out of line. Sorry.
- [chuckles] Not really.

161

It's the question everyone's asking.

162

Mm-hmm. What's your answer?

163
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,366
He did not do it.

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,957
He is handsome, yes.

175
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,795
But... [sighs]
...I don't know, I like talking to him.

176
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,924
Mm-hmm. He made you smile.

177
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,556
Maybe you should have a little adventure.

178
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,309
[scoffs] Please.

179
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,478
And-And with the media
following my every move?

180
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,730
They're stalking me.

181
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,274
- Oh, honey, they've already moved on.
- [chuckles]

182
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,610
They've got their footage,
and they're on to the next dead thing.

183
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,778
- It's a perk of living in Chicago.
- [sighs]

184
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,280
I don't know.

185
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,282
It's good to see you smile.

186
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:25,454
You're young, you're beautiful.
You should feel that way every day.

187
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,749
You are under so much pressure.

188
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,087
Are you seriously suggesting
I engage in a little...

189
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,718
extramarital revenge sex
with a bartender I just met?

190
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:43,680
I am suggesting that you tend to yourself.

191
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:48,018
An escape hatch of some sort
to help you get to the other side of this.

192
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,772
I mean, not now.
I get it, with everything going on.

193
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,357
But at some point.

194
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,443
I admire your fight,

195
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:02,616
your commitment to be in love,
to stay in love with the man you married.

196
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,372
Rusty isn't the man you married.

197
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,040
Let's face that.

198
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,627
[thunder rumbling]

199
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,341
[Tommy] I directly told you
to stand down, Detective.

200
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,676
- And I have.
- Bullshit.

201
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,636
You and Rusty went to visit
Liam Reynolds in prison.

202
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,888
Oh. That was on my own personal time.

203
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,348
You think this is funny?

204
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,767
Why would I waste funny
on somebody with no sense of humor?

205
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,894
- You know what is funny?
- What?

206
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,187
Fucking hilarious, actually,

207
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,731
is that you're not looking
at Reynolds for this.

208
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,568
Carolyn was tied up like Bunny Davis,
details not in the public domain--

209
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,236
Liam Reynolds is incarcerated.

210
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,780
So the fuck what? He threatened her.
He had a motive,

211
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,323
and you won't give it
so much as a look-see.

212
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,576
- Listen, Detective--
- Or, what? You'll fire me?

213
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,327
Two weeks into your new job? I think not.

214
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,246
Have the whole union up your ass.

215
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,748
Or maybe not.
I keep forgetting that you're popular.

216
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:55,711
Detective Rodriguez,
I'll walk you out. [clears throat]

217
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,259
If I may, you are off this case.

218
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,344
You will not impede it,
you will not obstruct it.

219
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,347
And I play poker with your union boss,
by the way.

220
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,891
Terrible fucking poker player. [chuckles]

221
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,268
You guys just want it to be Rusty so bad,
don't you?

222
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:14,271
Our only pursuit is justice.

223
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,566
Just be sure you do not
stand in that path.

224
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,861
Thank you.

225
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,516
Hey. Can you do me a favor?

226
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,560
I need you to go down to the ME's office,

227
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,687
pull all the files
on the Bunny Davis case.

228
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:57,898
Yeah.

229
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,702
[sighs]

230
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:13,914
[groans]

231
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,093
[keys jingle]

232
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,387
[rain pattering]

233
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,147
[thunder rumbling]

234
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:08,719
[metal clangs]

235
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,061
[building creaking, groaning]

236
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,914
[creaking continues]

237
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,546
Michael?

238
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,178
Michael, you asked me to come here.
What do you want?

239
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:55,641
Why did you kill her?

240
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,187
I didn't kill her.

241
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:02,981
I had a relationship with her,

242
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:06,318
and I will tell you anything
that you wanna know about that.

243
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:11,323
Michael, I wanna find out who killed her
just as much as you do.

244
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:14,034
Yeah, well, that's funny.
'Cause I have pictures of you.

245
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:16,994
You have what?

246
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:22,291
I have pictures and videos of you
on the night she died.

247
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,170
- Where?
- Her house!

248
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,048
Michael,
you have photographs of her that night?

249
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,926
Answer me.

250
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,970
You have photographs of that night?

251
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:36,431
You have photographs of other people
going in and out of her house?

252
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,935
You were literally the only one there.

253
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:46,316
Well, I guess, uh,
seems like you were there that night too.

254
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,568
Shut up!

255
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,444
Did you think this through?

256
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,322
Were you there other nights?

257
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,492
- [sighs]
- [Rusty] If you have photographs,

258
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:58,996
you need to make sure
that you give them to me,

259
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,956
or you give them to the police.

260
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:04,293
I already gave them to the police.
I met with the district attorney.

261
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,588
Then why are we here, Michael?

262
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,717
I wanted to see your face.

263
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:17,514
See your face? Why?
I don't buy it. [scoffs]

264
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,267
I don't know.
It was a very strange conversation,

265
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,811
and the kid is very clearly troubled
like you said, but--

266
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:26,940
but look, at least we now have evidence
that I wasn't the only one there.

267
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,444
- [Raymond] Are you sure he wasn't wired?
- If he was, I was careful.

268
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,237
Mya Winslow, Rusty Sabich.

269
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,155
Hi.

270
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,824
I asked Mya to join us
for the status conference.

271
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,160
- We gotta get your appearance filed.
- Already done.

272
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,495
- [Raymond] Excellent.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

273
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,831
Though not under these circumstances.

274
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,791
You can just observe on this one,
nothing to say.

275
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,503
- You, keep your mouth shut. Not a peep.
- [stammers]

276
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,755
This is my show. Don't fuck it up.

277
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,761
[Carolyn] <i>You're fucking it all up.</i>

278
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,973
- [sighs] You're fucking it all up.
- Why?

279
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,479
That falling-in-love part.

280
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,023
That we promised not to.

281
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,819
I don't think that you can control that.

282
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,280
Some things you can control.

283
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,245
And I have to be the one to-to--
to control it.

284
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,167
[Tommy] Tab one. Evidentiary exhibits.

285
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,839
Uh, path and lab reports
you'll find behind that in tab two.

286
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,217
That section is still incomplete
but is being updated daily.

287
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:38,095
- To be completed when?
- Uh, we're hoping ten days, Your Honor.

288
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,640
Photography and video exhibits
follow in tab three,

289
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,850
also to be completed forthwith.

290
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,853
We're still gathering,
including street and city cams.

291
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,772
Medical findings in tab four,

292
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,776
- and scientific exhibits and analysis...
- [stammers, sighs]

293
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,486
...behind it in tabs five and six.
What's the problem?

294
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,196
Just hold on a second.

295
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,031
- You've got me down as a witness.
- [Tommy] We do.

296
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,951
One of the charges
is obstruction of justice, Raymond,

297
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:03,620
and Mr. Sabich impeded this investigation.

298
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,832
In fact, he compromised it,
and you have information about that.

299
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:09,626
- This is a stunt.
- [Nico] No. Sorry. Just very quickly,

300
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,211
you took this post as counsel

301
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,173
while in possession of information
that's material to the charges.

302
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:16,383
- You should've known better.
- Mr. Delay Guardia.

303
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:20,012
Y-You've also got down Dr. Rush,
my client's psychiatrist.

304
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,805
[Tommy] We anticipate that
some of the subject matter

305
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,223
might qualify as privileged,

306
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,934
and Dr. Rush would be free to claim
that exemption should it apply.

307
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,811
- It will be.
- What do you mean, "should it apply"?

308
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,855
You're gonna ask her to come in,
she's gonna assert privilege,

309
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,565
and then he's gonna paint it
like we're hiding information.

310
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,775
- We will honor privileged information.
- Withholding evidence.

311
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:37,446
[Laryn] Gentlemen, we're not getting off
on a good bunion here.

312
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:40,240
We have a case to present. I would submit
Your Honor will let us do so.

313
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,454
When I took this job years ago,
I had a mentor.

314
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:49,833
He told me,
"Every trial is a bit like a hemorrhoid."

315
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,586
Hemorrhoids don't typically bother me.

316
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,547
I can even enjoy them
when properly managed.

317
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,760
I'm not enjoying myself now.

318
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:03,847
This trial will be about evidence and law.

319
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:07,601
What it won't be about is gamesmanship.
Do I make myself perfectly clear?

320
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,394
- [Raymond] Clear.
- Well said. Thank you.

321
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,357
May I also remind the court

322
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:17,152
that the prosecution has a duty
to turn over all exculpatory evidence.

323
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,404
- [Tommy] We've done so.
- [Raymond] You have?

324
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,448
[Tommy] We've turned over
all exculpatory evidence

325
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,075
per our duty as officers of the court.

326
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,159
So if you had evidence, say,

327
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,662
that someone else might have motive
to commit this crime...

328
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:27,746
There's no such evidence.

329
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:31,208
...or you may have evidence, say,
that someone else was there that night,

330
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:38,882
maybe someone with a camera
taking pictures and videos.

331
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:44,513
- Mr. Molto?
- Mmm.

332
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:46,974
- Yeah. I-I got it. I got it.
- [Raymond] Is that--

333
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:48,642
[Tommy]
We just received photographic evidence

334
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,019
that we're still in the process
of authenticating.

335
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,021
Once that authentication process
is complete,

336
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,231
we will share it with counsel.

337
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:57,609
Who proffered this photographic evidence?

338
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:00,279
The victim's son.

339
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,448
[Raymond] May I ask when it was proffered?

340
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:04,992
[Tommy]
We are in the process of analyzing it.

341
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:07,494
- And any disclosure would be premature.
- Oh, I see. I see. Hey.

342
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:10,706
You are gonna turn over
that evidence today,

343
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,249
to defense counsel and to me,

344
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,419
so we can all
properly analyze it together. Sound good?

345
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:19,006
And, Mr. Molto,

346
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,674
we are ten weeks from trial.

347
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:24,678
If you choose to hide anything else
from either defense counsel or this court,

348
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:26,597
I suggest that you not
stick it up your ass

349
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:28,974
'cause that's the first place
I'm gonna come looking.

350
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:32,102
[Rusty] Raymond was in his element.
You know, he was on fire.

351
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:35,439
And Tommy was in his element.

352
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:37,149
- [Jaden] Mmm.
- [Barbara] Bet he was.

353
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,943
The judge granted our motion
to access the scene,

354
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:43,071
and that's not something
that the defense usually gets.

355
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,365
- [Jaden] So a good day then?
- [Rusty] It's a good start.

356
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,202
That's good. Maybe we'll win,

357
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:51,038
and it'll be so great
that reporters will say,

358
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,499
"Rusty Sabich, you just won
the Super Bowl of murder trials.

359
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,960
What are you gonna do now?" [sighs]

360
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,171
And you'll say,
"We're going to Disneyland."

361
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,972
I would like to know
what evidence they have against you.

362
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,766
Jaden, not at the table.

363
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:13,143
- [Jaden] Yes, Mom. It's everywhere.
- [Barbara] Not at dinner.

364
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,354
- [Jaden] It's on the news, at school.
- [Barbara] Not at--

365
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:17,648
I just wanna know what is what.

366
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:20,442
What exactly do they have?

367
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,447
Mmm. Thank you.

368
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,410
[Rusty] Um... [clears throat]

369
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,289
...it's circumstantial.

370
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,000
Nobody's gonna be called to the stand
to say they saw me kill her

371
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,127
because I did not kill her.

372
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:43,257
But I was there that night,
and my DNA is all over her apartment,

373
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,676
and her DNA is all over my car.

374
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:49,930
And they're gonna say
that I was obsessed with her

375
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,517
because there are many, many,
many texts between me and her.

376
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:57,354
Mostly from me in those last few weeks.

377
00:23:57,354 --> 00:24:00,190
And obviously, there's the evidence
that she was pregnant with...

378
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:08,115
And the fact that she was tied up like a--
[stammers] a prior victim.

379
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:12,369
The killer must have had information
that wasn't available to the public.

380
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,790
Carolyn and I were the only two
most privy to that information,

381
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,042
so they're gonna make the argument

382
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:24,339
that I was in a unique position
to make it look like somebody else did it.

383
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,220
It's circumstantial,
and in a lot of ways it's a stretch,

384
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,306
but it's-it's damaging.

385
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:34,224
And all the evidence,
no matter how circumstantial,

386
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,309
points to me.

387
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,565
[inhales sharply]

388
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:43,650
And a plea?

389
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:48,488
- I mean, have you thought about that?
- A what?

390
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,199
- [Kyle] A plea.
- Kyle.

391
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,367
A guilty plea? Why--
What, do you think I did this, Kyle?

392
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,327
Honey.

393
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,704
I'm just saying,
if they offered manslaughter--

394
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:58,624
Why would I take a plea
for something that I did not do?

395
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,791
[Barbara] Rusty.

396
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:03,212
To avoid a life sentence.
Manslaughter's eight years.

397
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:04,546
Oh, honey.

398
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,521
[breathing heavily]

399
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,444
[no audible dialogue]

400
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:31,949
[no audible dialogue]

401
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:34,034
[heavy breathing continues]

402
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:48,340
[knocks on door]

403
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:51,885
[Barbara sighs]

404
00:25:57,391 --> 00:26:00,435
- He thinks that I did it.
- Rusty, he does not think you did it.

405
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,312
Then why would he ask me
to plead guilty for something

406
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:04,314
- he thinks that I didn't do?
- Because he's scared.

407
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,149
The kid is terrified.

408
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:10,195
That they could put you away forever.
[sighs]

409
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,448
[sighing]

410
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,911
Do you think that I-- that I should?

411
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:21,999
Does Jaden?

412
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,378
Do you think that I should
accept a plea bargain?

413
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:29,756
Rusty, no one in this family thinks
you should accept a plea bargain.

414
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,093
Kyle was just--

415
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,847
Honey, he was just thinking aloud.

416
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:42,394
He was thinking that I should
plead guilty for murder.

417
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:47,691
[sighs]

418
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:54,907
Honey, everyone is scared.

419
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:00,454
[breathes shakily]

420
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:05,792
Kate asked me to "step back"
from the gallery.

421
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,960
What? Why?

422
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:10,005
Bad for business, I guess.

423
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,091
- I'm sorry.
- [Kyle] Dad?

424
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,268
Hey.

425
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,979
I didn't mean to say
that I thought you did it.

426
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,689
I'm sorry, I just...

427
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:33,153
The way you made it sound
with the evidence and the--

428
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,238
I understand.

429
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:36,657
I'm sorry.

430
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,910
Please don't go. Please don't-- [stammers]

431
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,162
I'm sorry. [whimpers]

432
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:44,373
[sniffles]

433
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,929
["Obstacle 1" playing]

434
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,353
I think we should drop
the obstruction charge.

435
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:07,312
[Tommy] Why?

436
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:12,150
We can make Rusty out to be a bad actor,
but our burden is on homicide...

437
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,235
- Mmm.
- ...all right?

438
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:15,195
It's-It's a bigger hill to climb.

439
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:18,031
The jury are gonna want to get him, sure,

440
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:20,158
but the obstruction charge
allows them to do that

441
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:22,619
without finding him guilty of murder.

442
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,454
I just think
we just put one thing on the menu.

443
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,123
Right, but the abusive process charge

444
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:27,958
speaks to his attempts
to impede the investigation,

445
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,459
- which goes to his guilt.
- Think about it.

446
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,879
That's all I'm gonna say. Right?

447
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:37,634
Are you up to this?
Trying this particular case?

448
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,970
Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah, I am.

449
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,515
See? It's that.
That response right there makes me nervous

450
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,061
because it speaks to a certain zeal
that Raymond is gonna exploit.

451
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:48,979
[chuckles]

452
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:52,983
- Tommy, listen to me.
- [sniffs]

453
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,698
The words that shall attach
to this prosecution are "methodical,

454
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:01,241
exhaustive, and fair."

455
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:06,038
Words that shall not be associated
are "vindictive, maniacal, and vicious."

456
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:09,833
I understand, Nico.
Just don't talk to me like I'm a monkey.

457
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:16,173
Do you remember the first thing you said
when I made you chief deputy prosecutor?

458
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:18,383
- I believe I expressed my gratitude.
- [chuckles]

459
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:23,055
No. The first thing you said was,
"The girls are sure gonna like me now."

460
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,182
Turned out to be true.

461
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:28,101
I mean, there's just a part of you,
may-maybe it's your essence,

462
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:31,021
which just needs this validation, this--

463
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,398
- You know, to impress somebody.
- Oh.

464
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:37,069
And I know smart people
with a persecution complex,

465
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:41,532
and-and some with a narcissistic complex.

466
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:44,451
Somehow you have both. It's like a duplex.

467
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,996
Sounds expensive to fix.

468
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:52,960
- You hate Rusty. That's clear.
- No, no.

469
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,382
No, I don't hate Rusty.
I-- This is incredibly difficult for me.

470
00:29:58,382 --> 00:29:59,550
This is not difficult.

471
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:03,720
It's-It's because all the-the slights
and the digs and the nicks

472
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,431
and the-- and the cuts,
it-- it eats at you.

473
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,101
You want another drink?

474
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:10,686
Okay.

475
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:12,437
We need some hard evidence for murder.

476
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:15,649
That's coming.

477
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:24,825
So the site visit at Carolyn's
is later today.

478
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:27,244
You feel up to that?

479
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:29,079
Yes. I will be there.

480
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:29,997
Good.

481
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,541
- [Rusty] This fucking indictment.
- What are you doing?

482
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:35,002
"Trespass with force and arms."
It's just-- It's--

483
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,171
I mean,
I've dictated this a million times,

484
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,422
but to read it about me is...

485
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:43,010
So I've called, uh,
our friend Mr. Molto twice,

486
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,803
and I've left messages for him.

487
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:47,097
Well, if he doesn't call you back,
he's gonna be in contempt.

488
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:50,100
I left the car open. I'll be right back.

489
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,144
[door opens, closes]

490
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:53,687
[sighs]

491
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:16,793
Did you love her?

492
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:21,006
- Did I what?
- Carolyn.

493
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:23,050
Did you love her?

494
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:26,428
Um...

495
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:31,808
I'm actually not really sure
why that's relevant. [scoffs]

496
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:35,187
Raymond has tasked me with
building your narrative for trial

497
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:37,648
- in case you should have to testify.
- Uh-huh.

498
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:39,608
So he wants me to testify?

499
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:40,692
Well, just in case.

500
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:48,033
[clears throat]

501
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:53,205
Well, was it about lust?

502
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:56,917
- Love? Both?
- [sighs]

503
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:58,752
Okay, um...

504
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:02,673
[chuckles] ...both.

505
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:07,636
[breathes deeply]

506
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,099
Do you remember when you first felt
an emotional attachment?

507
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:14,810
Not when you first
wanted to have sex, but--

508
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,103
- Yeah. No, I understand.
- Okay.

509
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:18,647
Yeah.

510
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:23,277
We had a...

511
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:30,784
We had a case. Um, sexual assault.

512
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:33,579
The victim was a little girl.

513
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:35,247
These are twins. This is...

514
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:38,876
[Rusty] <i>We're not trained in kindness
as prosecutors.</i>

515
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,961
- <i>It's not a prerequisite.</i> [chuckles]
- Can you tell me...

516
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:43,172
[Rusty] <i>In fact,
sometimes I think it's trained out of us,</i>

517
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:45,549
but not Carolyn.

518
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:46,633
[girl] <i>I don't know.</i>

519
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:47,718
[Rusty] <i>And that day,</i>

520
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:52,598
there was something about the tenderness
that she showed that fragile little girl.

521
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:56,685
- This is Dell.
- [Carolyn] Dell.

522
00:32:56,685 --> 00:33:00,606
- This is Perla.
- [Carolyn] That's a lot of people.

523
00:33:00,606 --> 00:33:02,774
- Yeah.
- Are they friends?

524
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:04,568
- They're family.
- They're family?

525
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:11,158
So it might get a little scary in there,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

526
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:16,997
But, um, I'm gonna be with you
the whole time.

527
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:23,253
And then if you get too scared,
then you can raise your hand like this.

528
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,342
[chuckles] Good. [sniffles]

529
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:30,761
And I can come over,
and I can hold your hand.

530
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:33,430
We can stop whenever you want. [sniffles]

531
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,515
I can hold you,

532
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:38,560
and I can ask the judge
if we can go for a walk.

533
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:41,772
And I'll make sure
that you're always safe.

534
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,693
Do you think you can trust me with that?
[sniffles] To keep you safe?

535
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:48,529
- [chuckles, sniffles] Yeah?
- Yeah.

536
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,239
You're doing so good.

537
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:53,700
- [Rusty] <i>That was it.</i>
- [chuckles]

538
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,286
I guess that was the moment.

539
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:03,001
When you crossed over the great
I'm-gonna-fuck-up-my-life-forever divide.

540
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,754
Love isn't what people tell you
that it is, Mya.

541
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:07,464
I'm sure that I don't
have to tell you that.

542
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:08,799
But in my experience,

543
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:11,552
it's just something that grows
until one day...

544
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,097
you just find yourself needing someone.

545
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:18,433
That's how it was with Carolyn.

546
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:22,103
So, yeah.

547
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,149
Fucked up my life forever... [sighs]

548
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:28,902
...but I did not cross the other divide.

549
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:32,364
I would never have hurt her.

550
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:35,659
Somebody else did that,

551
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:40,246
and whoever that person is
is having a good fucking laugh

552
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:42,416
while everyone comes after me.

553
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,670
[players, spectators clamoring]

554
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,214
[umpire] Full count, 3-2.

555
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:59,141
- [grunts]
- [umpire] Strike three!

556
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:00,350
- He's out!
- [cheers]

557
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:35,469
[chuckles] This is beautiful.

558
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:40,516
You're desperate.

559
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:52,236
[investigators chattering]

560
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:19,930
[laughs]

561
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:24,393
[laughs]

562
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:27,646
[Raymond] So we just got the big dump
from Delay's office.

563
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,439
Expect them to start burying us...

564
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,566
Do you want another one?

565
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:32,317
<i>...with discovery tonnage:
documents, evidence, whatever,</i>

566
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:33,652
so we gotta keep pace.

567
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:36,029
Did they turn over the labs?

568
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:38,407
[Raymond] Not yet.

569
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:43,120
Well, it might be in this latest dump.
You never know.

570
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,540
- [both moaning]
- The forensics team is standing by.

571
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,751
It's a little needle in the haystack
at this point, you know?

572
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:52,713
But who knows?
We may find something they didn't.

573
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:55,007
My DNA must be all over this place.

574
00:36:57,843 --> 00:36:59,887
Rusty, we stipulated that you were here.

575
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:04,433
The two of you were having an affair.
It does not mean that you killed her.

576
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:09,229
Unless they find her blood in your car,
which they won't, right?

577
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:17,237
[breathing heavily] I know.

578
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:19,740
I keep seeing it too.

579
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,411
[sighs]

580
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,748
[Raymond] Listen. Talk to me for a second.

581
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:34,254
Rigo tells me
that you're trying to run down

582
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:38,050
the contaminated semen specimen
in the Bunny Davis case.

583
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,009
Yeah.

584
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:43,180
- If we offer the idea of another suspect...
- Ray.

585
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,058
...we can pretty much assume
the obligation to deliver one.

586
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:47,935
- And if we fail--
- Ray.

587
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:51,021
The prosecution is gonna show
the most brutal photographs of Carolyn

588
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:53,357
- on that night. It's gonna be horrific.
- [breathes heavily]

589
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:55,108
And then the jury's
gonna want someone to blame,

590
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:57,819
and if we don't have an alternative,
it's gonna be me.

591
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:01,240
- Let it go.
- No.

592
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:04,451
[Rigo] <i>Evidence number 13,
voicemail number four...</i>

593
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:06,453
- [sighs]
- <i>...victim's message on defendant's phone.</i>

594
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:09,206
[Carolyn] <i>What do you want, Rusty,
out of this?</i>

595
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:10,916
- <i>I don't have much else to give.</i>
- [sighs]

596
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:13,418
[Rusty] <i>I understand
wanting distance for a while</i>

597
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:16,004
<i>but that-that's partly
what has been so difficult for me.</i>

598
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:17,548
- [grunts]
- [Carolyn] <i>I would be open</i>

599
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:20,300
<i>to having another conversation
if you think that it will be helpful.</i>

600
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,135
[Rusty] <i>No, I hate pretending
that you're not there.</i>

601
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:24,304
<i>I don't understand
why you're just not picking up.</i>

602
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:26,515
[Carolyn] <i>I don't think you understand
my perspective on things.</i>

603
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:27,891
- [exhales]
- <i>I need you to stop</i>

604
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:29,852
<i>calling me like this, Rusty.
This isn't fair.</i>

605
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,937
[Rusty] <i>I've never disagreed
with anything more.</i>

606
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:33,355
<i>All the evidence I have
tells me you love me.</i>

607
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:34,857
We'll present to you physical, scientific,

608
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:37,067
forensic evidence that will lead you
to make your own con--

609
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:39,152
That will lead you to form
your own conclusions.

610
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:42,531
Think! [mumbles] Facts!

611
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:46,285
[dog barking]

612
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:49,830
[phone beeps]

613
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:05,095
[sighs] Fuck. [groans]

614
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,764
All right. [breathing heavily]

615
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:28,887
[sighs]
