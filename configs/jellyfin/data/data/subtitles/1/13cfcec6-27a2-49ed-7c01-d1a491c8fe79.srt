1
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,765
Oh, you like it rough, don't you?

2
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:16,765
Say it!

3
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:18,365
I like it rough!
Say it.

4
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:19,845
I like it rough.

5
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:22,125
You're so dirty.

6
00:01:22,285 --> 00:01:24,645
Oh, you're filthy, you know that?

7
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:28,725
Oh...

8
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:31,005
Oh, shit.

9
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:36,965
Oh...what could possibly
be so important at this hour?

10
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,725
I don't know.
That's why I'm checking.

11
00:01:40,365 --> 00:01:42,445
Oh, fuck.

12
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:45,685
Skiddy?
Worse than Skiddy.

13
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:50,805
When did texting take pre-eminence

14
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:53,925
over actual live human
intercourse, I wonder.

15
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:55,725
It doesn't matter
where you are these days —

16
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:58,885
in a meeting, dinner with friends,

17
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:01,845
the back of a limo
rooting another man's wife —

18
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:03,965
if someone gets a text, that's it.

19
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,845
Everything on the planet
has to stop and give way.

20
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:08,325
Ohh, yes?

21
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:10,085
Yes.

22
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:21,365
Oh, yes, reply to the reply.

23
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:22,965
Oh, just be quiet.
Marvellous.

24
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:26,685
One second. Push me over.
I can't reach. Ooh!

25
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:28,525
I'll just be one second.

26
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:34,405
I mean, I bet if this fuckwit
had have phoned instead of texting

27
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:36,725
you would've said, “Oh, bugger it.
He can wait until morning.”

28
00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:39,085
But, oh, no, no, no, he texted,

29
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:42,285
just as surely as God
would have to Moses

30
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:46,805
had Moses been able to get good
reception up there on Mount Sinai.

31
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:52,045
Let it be known
and proclaimed throughout the land

32
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,845
that in this brave, new,
broadly-banded world,

33
00:02:56,005 --> 00:03:01,125
conversation is now officially
a second-class citizen.

34
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:02,845
Mmm.

35
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,765
Are you sure we can trust him?

36
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:13,965
Yeah, Claude, it's cool. He's a mate.

37
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,325
Remember the bloke
who was busted desecrating

38
00:03:16,485 --> 00:03:18,685
Rookwood Cemetery last year?

39
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:21,525
The one who pissed
on all those graves?

40
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:25,765
Oh, come on. The poor man had
a terrible urinary tract infection.

41
00:03:25,925 --> 00:03:29,045
Anyway, he owes me big-time.

42
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,485
Oil

43
00:03:36,645 --> 00:03:38,125
You forgot something.

44
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,965
What?
Your lifeline.

45
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:47,845
Hmm.

46
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:54,605
Mate, I'm busting for a pee.

47
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:57,245
You must know somewhere.

48
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:20,925
The man seen here

49
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:23,365
passionately kissing
the New South Wales Premier...

50
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:24,845
Oh, Jesus.

51
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:27,485
..has been identified as
criminal barrister Cleaver Greene.

52
00:04:27,645 --> 00:04:30,485
Why do they always say it like that?

53
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,605
“Criminal BARRISTER”?

54
00:04:32,765 --> 00:04:35,125
For God's sake,
I'm not a criminal barrister.

55
00:04:35,285 --> 00:04:38,325
Get the em-PHA-sis right,
for God's sake.

56
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:42,405
Your Honour, what sort
of madness is this

57
00:04:42,565 --> 00:04:45,085
that here and now in the 21st century

58
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:50,485
in this palazzo of justice
we call Court 11-C,

59
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:55,525
we three men are debating the right of
a woman to choose her own clothes?

60
00:04:55,685 --> 00:04:57,725
The tyranny of misogyny, Your Honour,

61
00:04:57,885 --> 00:04:59,285
must be consigned
to the waste basket...

62
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:02,005
Mr Greene, are you daring
to suggest that wearing a burga

63
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:04,205
is somehow an expression
of your client's feminism?

64
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:07,405
With due respect, Your Honour,
my client doesn't wear a burqa.

65
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:09,925
She wears a nigab.

66
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:11,405
The difference being...?

67
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:14,925
The former is, to all intents
and purposes, a body bag,

68
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:17,605
the latter a simple veil.

69
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:19,965
Be that as it may, Mr Greene,

70
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,125
the jury and the court
both have a right

71
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:25,245
to be able to scrutinise
the disposition of any witness.

72
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:27,885
Mr Forsythe, is there anything else?

73
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:31,205
Yes, Your Honour. There was
the matter of the video confession.

74
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:34,285
Yeah, well, that appears
to be pretty straightforward so...

75
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:37,365
Mr Greene?

76
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:40,525
Your Honour, I would submit
that this video footage

77
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:44,525
is full of unsubstantiated
and uncorroborated assertions

78
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:46,285
by my client's husband

79
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:48,845
who, sadly, is unavailable
for cross-examination,

80
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:50,925
having blown himself
to kingdom come.

81
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:55,485
Your Honour, the video clearly
implicates Mrs Mohammed

82
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:58,165
in a conspiracy to blow up
Parliament House.

83
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,805
Alright, let's take a look.

84
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:03,285
By our actions,

85
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:07,245
the people of Australia
will know the power of our faith.

86
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:14,005
Your Parliament is no more,
having been...razed from the ground.

87
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,485
And the dogs within —

88
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:17,005
your prime minister,
your foreign minister —

89
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:18,485
they're gone too.

90
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:22,365
Such is the consequence
of joining the infidels of America

91
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,285
and other enemies of Islam

92
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:28,085
and killing of the brothers
and sisters of Iran...

93
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:30,925
..Iraq, sorry, and Afghanistan.

94
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:36,165
I go to paradise a martyr
where adorned virgins will meet me.

95
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:38,525
Jesus. What a dickhead!

96
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:42,205
If I was the Mufti
responsible for his conversion

97
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:43,765
I'd be hanging my head in shame.

98
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:46,085
If I was the Mufti
responsible for his conversion

99
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:48,125
I'd have told him
to give Scientology a crack.

100
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:52,805
Where's he hail from, Ken?
He's an Albany boy.

101
00:06:52,965 --> 00:06:56,165
Born Michael Francis Coorey,

102
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:59,525
Irish Catholic mother,
Lebanese Catholic father,

103
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,445
the full Marist Brothers catastrophe,

104
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:05,165
odd jobs, a brief stint panelbeating,

105
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,125
found Islam somewhere along the line

106
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:11,045
and ended up in Yemen
where he became Yousef Mohammed

107
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:12,725
and met Zuharah,

108
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:16,765
now known either
as Mrs Mohammed or the accused.

109
00:07:16,925 --> 00:07:19,445
He didn't even have
the right fucking parliament!

110
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:24,485
It looks like your girlfriend
dodged a bullet there, Cleave.

111
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:25,965
Oh, yeah.

112
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:29,005
Yeah, tell us, Cleave, the premier —

113
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:31,045
is she a moaner or a screamer?

114
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:32,565
Oh, ha-ha.

115
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:37,005
Order! Order!

116
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,805
Order!

117
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:41,925
The Leader of the Opposition
will resume his seat!

118
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:43,565
The Premier has the call.

119
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:45,045
Thank you, Mr Speaker.

120
00:07:45,205 --> 00:07:46,765
As I was saying,

121
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,765
I deeply and sincerely
regret the pain...

122
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:54,565
..this indiscretion has caused.

123
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,285
I ask that at this difficult time

124
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:59,325
my family's privacy be respected.

125
00:07:59,485 --> 00:08:02,285
Hear, hear!

126
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:05,645
The task at hand
is to rebuild this state, Mr Speaker.

127
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:08,845
The task at hand
is to rise again from the ashes

128
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:10,845
left by those opposite,

129
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:14,045
who seem to have nothing to offer
the people of this great state

130
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:16,125
than gossip and debasement.

131
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,525
Order!

132
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:23,005
The Shadow Attorney-General

133
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:24,485
and the Shadow Minister
for Police, Transport,

134
00:08:24,645 --> 00:08:26,485
Infrastructure, Racing, Gaming,

135
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:29,925
Climate Change, Environment
and Ethnic Affairs.

136
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:34,885
The Premier calls it
an indiscretion, Mr Speaker.

137
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:38,805
She calls it a mere indiscretion.

138
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,645
Well, I wonder what her husband,

139
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:42,205
the Attorney-General
and Police Minister,

140
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:43,685
thinks about that.

141
00:08:43,845 --> 00:08:46,325
Do you think it was
just an indiscretion, Cal?

142
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,085
Order!

143
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:50,045
Order! ORDER!

144
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:52,445
You see, Mr Speaker...

145
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:56,685
..Mr Speaker, it's not just a matter of
the Premier betraying her family.

146
00:08:56,845 --> 00:09:00,685
It's not just a question of her lack
of decency and integrity.

147
00:09:00,845 --> 00:09:03,965
The fact that the Premier
would have an extramarital affair

148
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:06,365
with someone like Cleaver Greene

149
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:08,245
is something else altogether.

150
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:10,805
Order!

151
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:14,325
Cleaver Greene
is a dishonest low-life...

152
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:17,365
..who spends his days
defending society's scum

153
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:19,485
and his nights carousing with them!

154
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:25,165
As we speak, Greene
is defending a terrorist...

155
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:29,285
ALLEGED! Alleged terrorist. Hello!
Shh!

156
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,445
His story, Mr Speaker,

157
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:36,285
is a disgraceful and tawdry tale
of dishonour and deceit,

158
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:38,725
as is the Premier's!

159
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:40,445
Shut up!

160
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:44,605
Hm, he's got a lovely
speaking voice, hasn't he?

161
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:48,085
Sue. I'll sue. I will
sue the bastard for defamation.

162
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:49,765
You can't, mate.
Parliamentary privilege.

163
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:52,365
It's an abuse of the privilege,
is what it is.

164
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,925
So what can you do about that?

165
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:57,165
- Well, I'm going to...
- I'm...

166
00:09:57,325 --> 00:09:58,885
Nicole!

167
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:20,085
Sorry you had to go through that.

168
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,285
Just politics.

169
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:25,965
You think I should resign?

170
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,085
Well, I wouldn't
be Robinson Crusoe if I did.

171
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:31,045
They're not going to make you leader,
if that's what you're thinking, Cal.

172
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:32,605
You know how you poll.

173
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,085
If I resign now,
it's either Stevie or Bill.

174
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:37,885
Well, it could be Karen.
Oh, long shot.

175
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:40,405
If it is Stevie or Bill
you're rooted too, you know?

176
00:10:40,565 --> 00:10:43,085
So...you need me

177
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:44,965
and I need you.

178
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:48,365
It's like we're
reaffirming our vows.

179
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,565
Come.

180
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:52,885
Premier. Attorney.

181
00:10:53,045 --> 00:10:54,365
Premier. Attorney.

182
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:55,925
Yep, so how bad is it?

183
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:58,925
We're fine with the blokes if the focus
groups are anything to go by.

184
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:00,965
Get a little bounce if anything.
And women?

185
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,685
Well, that depends. If it was
for love, you're fine — 71%.

186
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:06,645
And if it was purely sexual?

187
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:08,605
You're a skank — 90%.

188
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:10,285
And I should be...?

189
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:12,325
Standing by your woman, Cal — 76%.

190
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:16,725
Hm. OK, so I guess
it's genuine love, then.

191
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,205
And forgiveness.

192
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:20,205
OK, love and forgiveness it is.
Thank you, gentlemen.

193
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:23,605
So you utterly reject

194
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:26,045
the Shadow Attorney-General's
characterisation of you

195
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:27,965
as a low-life,
do you, Cleaver Greene?

196
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,965
I do.
I refute it in its entirety.

197
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:36,605
The Shadow Minister for Toasters,
Lobotomies and Nasal Hair,

198
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:38,685
Harry-sorry-David Potter,

199
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:42,285
hid like the coward he is under
the cloak of parliamentary privilege

200
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:44,645
when he made those obscene
remarks about me this morning.

201
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:49,485
Now, if Mr Potter really had the courage
of his so-called convictions,

202
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:53,045
if he had any intestinal
fortitude whatsoever,

203
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:57,645
he would repeat that scurrilous filth
outside the protection of Parliament.

204
00:11:57,805 --> 00:12:00,245
“Cleaver Greene
is a dishonest low-life

205
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:02,925
‘who spends his days
defending society's scum

206
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:04,845
“and his nights carousing with them.

207
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:06,805
“His story, Mr Speaker,

208
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:10,845
“is a disgraceful and tawdry tale
of dishonour and deceit,

209
00:12:11,005 --> 00:12:12,845
“as is the Premier's.”

210
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:18,125
Oh, itis on! It is on, mofo!

211
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:23,045
I am taking you down
for Queen and country

212
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:25,725
and maybe a little beach house
down the South Coast.

213
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:29,485
What? Oh, Jesus Christ.

214
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:32,245
Well, I mean... For God's sake, Cleaver.
Don't be such a dickhead.

215
00:12:32,405 --> 00:12:34,285
You sue him, you play
right into his hands.

216
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:35,765
What are you talking about?

217
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:37,365
Your life and character

218
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:40,445
under a microscope
in a defamation case.

219
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:42,445
Come on, that's exactly
what he wants —

220
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:44,125
a chance to flail you alive.

221
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:46,725
You'll lose and end up
having to pay his costs.

222
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:49,605
Get that.

223
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:53,485
Cleaver Greene's chambers.

224
00:12:53,645 --> 00:12:55,165
And it's ‘flay', not ‘flail'.

225
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:57,125
Oh, just one moment.
Flay.

226
00:12:57,285 --> 00:12:59,765
Oh! “Sorry”? “Sorry”?!

227
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:02,245
I have had it with your ‘sorry's!

228
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:05,205
From day one,
this whole fucking relationship

229
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:09,205
has just been
one long series of ‘sorry's!

230
00:13:09,365 --> 00:13:11,725
I want you out of this house.

231
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:15,885
I want you out of this house and
I never, ever want to see you again!

232
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,725
Do you hear me?!

233
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:23,165
Oh.
I need a safe haven.

234
00:13:23,325 --> 00:13:25,325
I'm not sure this is the place
right now, Cleave.

235
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:27,885
What's the matter? Is it Todd?

236
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:32,605
He's been screwing some waitress.

237
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:35,005
Her husband was waiting for me
when I got home.

238
00:13:35,165 --> 00:13:36,765
Jesus. How long has this...

239
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:39,285
Since before we even met,
it would seem.

240
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:40,845
Really? The whole time?
No, no, no.

241
00:13:41,005 --> 00:13:44,645
If you even give me so much as an
“I told you so,” I swear to God...

242
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:47,485
Hey, Todd.

243
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:49,045
Hey, Cleave.

244
00:13:49,205 --> 00:13:50,805
I want you to leave now, Todd.

245
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:53,885
No, you don't want me to do that.
Yeah, I do, I do.

246
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:56,725
I made a mistake, Wends, OK?
I am sorry.

247
00:13:56,885 --> 00:14:00,005
No, no, no, stop saying sorry
like it means something.

248
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:02,085
I tried to end it
with the other girl! Cleave.

249
00:14:02,245 --> 00:14:03,565
Don't...
I really... I did.

250
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:05,445
Mate, there's no point.
She's heard it all before.

251
00:14:05,605 --> 00:14:07,045
Yeah, but I swear it's the truth!

252
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:09,805
The thing is she...

253
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:11,485
..she kept threatening
to hurt herself.

254
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:15,205
So what? So you're the real
victim in this situation, are you?

255
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:18,365
Well...yes, yes, I believe I am.

256
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,445
Where the fuck is your imagination?!
Mate, no, no.

257
00:14:20,605 --> 00:14:22,165
I mean, at least Cleaver
respected me enough

258
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:23,725
to make some effort
with his bullshit.

259
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:25,205
That's right. I really put in.

260
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,605
He once told me that two Asian girls
I found him comforting

261
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:29,405
were Aung San Suu Kyi's cousins.

262
00:14:29,565 --> 00:14:32,325
Somehow she saw
straight through it.

263
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:35,325
At least we had
a few good years.

264
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:40,805
Is that the benchmark
for a happy marriage these days,

265
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,125
a few good years?

266
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:46,605
What was I thinking?

267
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:49,125
I meet another lawyer
who loves to party.

268
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:52,685
Do I run a mile?
No, no. No, that would...

269
00:14:52,845 --> 00:14:55,325
I marry the bastard
three months later.

270
00:14:56,805 --> 00:15:00,365
“Those who do not learn from history
are doomed to repeat it.”

271
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,045
Oh, correct.

272
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:05,205
Oh, don't tell me
you've become one of them.

273
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:06,685
One of who?

274
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:10,405
Oh, one of those smug arseholes
who says, “Correct,”

275
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:14,485
because they're so up themselves
they think they can own a conver...

276
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:17,005
Oh, darling.

277
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:36,725
Oh...I see you've been
rooting the premier.

278
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:40,285
Political protest, darling.

279
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:42,605
At heart, I'm really an activist.

280
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:56,365
Oh.

281
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:58,525
Mmm.

282
00:16:05,605 --> 00:16:08,205
Um... Oh. Is that you, darling?

283
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:15,885
Mum? Dad?

284
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:17,525
Hi, mate.

285
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,205
What's going on?

286
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:22,205
Oh, it's not what it looks like.

287
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:25,205
Your mum just lost her hearing aid
down the back of the sofa.

288
00:16:25,365 --> 00:16:26,965
The thing is, darling, um...

289
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:31,845
Uh, it turns out that Todd's been...

290
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:34,605
Yeah, he's been busted.

291
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:37,725
There's a shock.

292
00:17:03,725 --> 00:17:06,885
Zuharah. Kids.

293
00:17:07,045 --> 00:17:08,965
Sorry we're so late.

294
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,605
Please come in, come in.

295
00:17:14,765 --> 00:17:16,085
Sounds like someone's having fun.

296
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:18,205
That is where I conduct
my business.

297
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:21,045
Please, please.

298
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:27,365
They can't make me take my veil off.

299
00:17:27,525 --> 00:17:31,405
Yes, they can, Zuharah.
You...you're the accused.

300
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:33,365
They'll do it forcibly if necessary.

301
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:37,485
One, two, three.
Don't say anything.

302
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,925
It is God's will
I wear it in public.

303
00:17:42,085 --> 00:17:44,685
Well, unless you can
call God as a witness...

304
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:48,605
I'm not sure he'd have standing
as an expert in this state.

305
00:17:52,885 --> 00:17:56,365
You two think you're so clever
and superior, don't you?

306
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:59,085
No. We mean no offence, Zuharah.

307
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,645
Please don't patronise me.

308
00:18:00,805 --> 00:18:03,165
You are nothing
but a couple of hypocrites.

309
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:04,645
Oh, really?

310
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:06,365
Especially you, Mr Greene.

311
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:08,885
Tell me, what will you
be wearing at my trial?

312
00:18:09,045 --> 00:18:10,605
You will be prancing
around the court

313
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:13,325
in a black gown and a white wig,
will you not?

314
00:18:13,485 --> 00:18:15,525
And you think my veil is silly.

315
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:18,365
At least it serves a purpose.

316
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,045
Look, I take your point,

317
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:25,645
but the judge is gonna want to see
your face and so will the jury.

318
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,805
And so do I, to be perfectly frank.

319
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:30,485
I mean, I'm defending you
on a very, very serious charge

320
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:34,845
and if I'm gonna sell you to a jury
I need to get to know you, Zuharah.

321
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:36,765
The whole point
of the veil, Mr Greene,

322
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:39,325
is so that men like you
can't get to know me.

323
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,445
Men like me?

324
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:44,725
Men who seduce married women
in limousines.

325
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:47,125
Tell me, Mr Greene,

326
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:50,805
do you think you and the premier
would be in this ugly mess

327
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:53,325
if she had been dressed
as a married woman ought?

328
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:58,725
You are charged with conspiracy
to commit a terrorist act.

329
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:00,525
If you're found guilty

330
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:03,045
you're gonna go to jail
for the rest of your life

331
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:06,125
and you'll see your daughters
for a couple of hours a year.

332
00:19:06,285 --> 00:19:10,045
You have to help me
to help you.

333
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:12,525
You understand?

334
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:20,549
http://hiqve.com/

335
00:19:40,925 --> 00:19:44,565
I am a good Muslim.

336
00:19:45,765 --> 00:19:47,525
You support jihad?

337
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:51,005
Do you know what the word
‘jihad' actually means?

338
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,085
‘Struggle'.

339
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:59,325
We all struggle spiritually,
gentlemen.

340
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:03,805
Violent jihad, on the other hand,
is the work of the devil, not God.

341
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:07,405
Islam preaches peace.

342
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:11,085
I do not want my daughters
to grow up in a world

343
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:13,445
where they are taught to hate.

344
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:17,845
OK, so maybe you can tell us why

345
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:21,885
large quantities of hydrogen peroxide,
propanone and ammonia

346
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:24,325
were delivered
to your house in your name?

347
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:32,005
How does someone like her
end up marrying such a tool?

348
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:34,765
The man got lost on the way
to the wrong parliament.

349
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:36,725
Mm, and she's smart.

350
00:20:36,885 --> 00:20:38,325
She's kind of hot.

351
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:40,685
Am I allowed to say that
without getting fatwahed?

352
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:42,245
Maybe it was a spiritual thing.

353
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:46,365
Or maybe he was
her ticket out of Yemen.

354
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,565
You know how Ken's gonna play it.

355
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:50,845
‘Terrorist - the Musical'.
Uh-huh.

356
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:54,165
It'll run for a decade
and Zuharah's the star.

357
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:59,645
‘Zuharah Mohammed'. Christ, there's
four guilty votes just in her name.

358
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:04,765
Hey, have you spoken to Scarlet
again about Maxy's birthday?

359
00:21:04,925 --> 00:21:06,605
And...? Yep

360
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,165
Still a no.

361
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:11,165
Christ, your wife's a ball-buster.

362
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:13,845
What does she want from me?
Have you told her I've already...

363
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:16,645
Already bought the present. Yeah.

364
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:29,765
More?

365
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:34,405
He's gonna go nuts.

366
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:38,845
Where's it all gonna fit? There's gotta
be some room for the guests.

367
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:42,325
No, this morning I mapped it
all out. We're fine.

368
00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:44,325
Vino?

369
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:47,605
Oh, no. I'm good, thanks.

370
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:51,565
Now, I've culled the audition tapes
for the clowns down to five,

371
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:53,405
but we need to look at them tonight

372
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:55,445
because we're cutting that
way too fine.

373
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,165
Darling, this is
a seven-year-old's birthday party.

374
00:21:58,325 --> 00:22:00,205
You've done nothing else
for three weeks.

375
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:02,765
It's like you're planning
the invasion of Afghanistan.

376
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:04,805
Huh, if only I had!

377
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:07,765
Don't you think it might be
just a little over the top?

378
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:12,485
I wanna make it perfect for him, OK?

379
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:14,405
OK.

380
00:22:19,365 --> 00:22:21,205
So...

381
00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:23,525
So...

382
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,965
Cleaver asked me to ask again.

383
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:33,245
Feel free to ask,
but risk disappointment.

384
00:22:33,405 --> 00:22:35,325
OK, I won't.

385
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:37,245
Honey, don't be like that.

386
00:22:37,405 --> 00:22:39,045
Well, it's not easy for me.

387
00:22:39,205 --> 00:22:41,005
We're teetering
on the edge of tranquillity

388
00:22:41,165 --> 00:22:44,405
and you want to bring
Cleaver back into our lives?

389
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,885
He's had some bad luck.

390
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:48,645
Bad luck?

391
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:51,925
Darling,
slipping down the stairs

392
00:22:52,085 --> 00:22:54,205
and breaking your leg is bad luck,

393
00:22:54,365 --> 00:22:56,725
not getting busted
having sex with the premier

394
00:22:56,885 --> 00:22:59,685
in the back of a limo
owned by a guy who gets his kicks

395
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,845
out of pissing
on the graves of dead nuns.

396
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,365
After everything that's happened,

397
00:23:03,525 --> 00:23:08,725
if 'm prepared to forgive him,
to forgive and forget?

398
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:13,445
OK, don't do it for him.

399
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:15,525
Do it for me.

400
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,725
Please.

401
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:22,125
He'll be on his best behaviour.

402
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:24,085
I promise.

403
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,605
- There he is.
- Here he comes.

404
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:36,125
- How about a photo?
- Oh, yes, here we go.

405
00:23:36,285 --> 00:23:38,605
You seen the premier again?
Stay in the middle, alright?

406
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:40,645
On the premier,
are you in love with her?

407
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:42,565
Oh, I...

408
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:45,365
Mr Greene,
are you a love rat?

409
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:48,045
Love rat? A love rat? Huh.

410
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:50,605
Ladies and gentlemen,
my client, Mrs Mohammed,

411
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:53,805
looks like a terrorist, doesn't she?

412
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,725
She sounds like a terrorist.

413
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:58,965
Even her name is the sort of name

414
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:01,605
you might reasonably expect
a terrorist to have —

415
00:24:01,765 --> 00:24:03,765
Zuharah Mohammed.

416
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:06,445
Now, I know that you are all

417
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:10,845
good, decent, fair-minded folk,

418
00:24:11,005 --> 00:24:14,245
but over the last decade or so

419
00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:20,285
our suspicion of Islamic people has
blossomed, for want of a better word,

420
00:24:20,445 --> 00:24:25,805
into an irrational but genuine fear.

421
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,565
Now, during the course of this trial

422
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:32,725
you are duty-bound
to ignore that fear —

423
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:34,925
ignore her clothes,

424
00:24:35,085 --> 00:24:39,085
ignore her skin colour,
ignore her name.

425
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:43,645
And I would ask you instead
to focus on the facts.

426
00:24:43,805 --> 00:24:48,205
My client is a loving mother
of two beautiful young girls,

427
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:50,965
she is a devoted sister and aunt,

428
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,925
she's a deeply spiritual woman

429
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:59,005
and she is a small business person of
some repute in south-western Sydney.

430
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:03,045
Mrs Mohammed,
what sort of individuals

431
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:07,765
attend your Essential Oils
and Beauty Treatment Salon?

432
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:11,045
It is a service
exclusively for Muslim women.

433
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:15,805
I should say it is not so much a salon
as a room in our house.

434
00:25:15,965 --> 00:25:18,205
Sounds very discreet
and innocuous.

435
00:25:18,365 --> 00:25:20,285
That's because it is, Mr Forsythe.

436
00:25:20,445 --> 00:25:22,685
And what prompted you
to start up this business?

437
00:25:22,845 --> 00:25:26,325
My husband was unable to find work.
We needed the money.

438
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:29,845
Mrs Mohammed, I put it to you

439
00:25:30,005 --> 00:25:32,405
that in conjunction
with your husband,

440
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:35,125
you set up your business
as a means to obtain,

441
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:36,885
without raising suspicion,

442
00:25:37,045 --> 00:25:40,445
the chemicals required to make
lethal explosive devices.

443
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:41,925
I deny that.

444
00:25:42,085 --> 00:25:43,685
You had regular deliveries

445
00:25:43,845 --> 00:25:47,965
of hydrogen peroxide,
ammonia and propanone

446
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:49,965
made to your house in your name.

447
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:51,925
That is correct.
Large quantities sometimes.

448
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:54,845
It is more economical
to buy in bulk.

449
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,885
And where were the chemicals kept?

450
00:25:58,045 --> 00:26:02,445
In a padlocked steel cabinet inside
a locked room. We have children.

451
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:04,765
The chemicals were
for all intents and purposes

452
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:06,485
your property, were they not?

453
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:07,965
Yes.

454
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:10,045
You were the one
who made the bomb.

455
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:14,245
That's not true!
I reject violence, as does God.

456
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:18,125
Mrs Mohammed, you've seen
the video your husband made

457
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,325
before he set out on his journey
of mass destruction?

458
00:26:21,485 --> 00:26:23,965
Objection.
Apologies, Your Honour.

459
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:27,205
Mrs Mohammed?
I've seen the video.

460
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:30,045
It was taken in your house,
was it not?

461
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:35,085
It was. You can tell by the tapestry
hanging on our living room wall.

462
00:26:36,525 --> 00:26:38,645
You were behind the camera,
were you not?

463
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,245
No.
Then who was?

464
00:26:42,245 --> 00:26:44,445
We have a tripod, Mr Forsythe.

465
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:52,205
Mrs Mohammed, propanone is also
known as acetone, is it not?

466
00:26:52,365 --> 00:26:54,445
Itis.

467
00:26:54,605 --> 00:26:59,085
Now, why in the devil would you need
acetone in a beauty salon?

468
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:00,885
Acetone is nail polish remover.

469
00:27:01,045 --> 00:27:04,445
Oh, I see. Oh, oh.

470
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:06,325
And what about ammonia?

471
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:08,725
Surely that can't
be good for the skin.

472
00:27:08,885 --> 00:27:12,045
Ammonia is a common
and highly effective cleaning agent.

473
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:16,125
And I imagine a reputable
salon proprietor such as yourself

474
00:27:16,285 --> 00:27:20,645
would be keen on trying to maintain
quite a pristine working environment?

475
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,365
Yes, yes, I do.

476
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:25,445
And what about hydrogen peroxide?

477
00:27:25,605 --> 00:27:30,165
Hair bleach. A lot of my clients
are very self-conscious.

478
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:33,845
According to Exhibit B-17,

479
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:37,085
33 litres of hydrogen peroxide

480
00:27:37,245 --> 00:27:40,445
were dispensed over
one 2-week period.

481
00:27:40,605 --> 00:27:44,165
That would suggest a lot of heads
in need of bleaching, Mrs Mohammed.

482
00:27:44,325 --> 00:27:48,565
Yes, Your Honour, it's not
just their heads, you see.

483
00:27:48,725 --> 00:27:50,725
What do you mean,
“It's not just their heads”?

484
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:55,165
Well, there are...other body parts

485
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:59,045
that may perhaps be transformed
by the use of hydrogen peroxide.

486
00:27:59,205 --> 00:28:01,445
Really? What parts, Mr Greene?

487
00:28:01,605 --> 00:28:04,645
Uh, well, one doesn't want
to be indelicate, Your Honour.

488
00:28:04,805 --> 00:28:07,805
Indelicate? Would you please
speak frankly to the court?

489
00:28:07,965 --> 00:28:09,365
Very well.

490
00:28:09,525 --> 00:28:12,125
Uh, I am reliably informed,
Your Honour,

491
00:28:12,285 --> 00:28:14,925
that there is currently available

492
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:18,125
a very popular procedure
called anal bleaching.

493
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:23,005
Yes, well, um...
Thank you, Mr Bleach...

494
00:28:23,165 --> 00:28:26,845
Mr Brown... Mr Greene.

495
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,565
I think this might
be an appropriate time.

496
00:28:28,725 --> 00:28:30,805
All rise.

497
00:28:33,725 --> 00:28:36,365
Red,
the house looks lovely.

498
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:38,525
The house looks
lovely...

499
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:41,765
Red...

500
00:28:41,925 --> 00:28:44,645
Red,
the house looks love... Oh.

501
00:28:44,805 --> 00:28:47,365
I could blame
our respective workloads for this,

502
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,925
but the truth is...

503
00:28:54,565 --> 00:28:58,005
..I have been emotionally absent
from our marriage for some time...

504
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:02,205
..and I must take my share
of the responsibility.

505
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,325
/ felt alone.

506
00:29:05,485 --> 00:29:06,805
Um...

507
00:29:06,965 --> 00:29:10,445
I am a woman
who has always loved to love

508
00:29:10,605 --> 00:29:16,205
and then this strange man,
Cleaver Greene, came into my life

509
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:19,485
and I felt a need, a longing.

510
00:29:19,645 --> 00:29:24,445
Oh, the only thing you ever
longed for was a nasty shag.

511
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:26,725
..Spun a web of words.

512
00:29:26,885 --> 00:29:30,965
l...1 fell deeply
in love with him...

513
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:34,685
Bring me a bucket!

514
00:29:34,845 --> 00:29:36,565
..though it was torture
emotionally.

515
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:39,565
I was full of guilt and remorse

516
00:29:39,725 --> 00:29:42,045
and when I told Cleaver
I had to break it off

517
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:43,565
he threatened to go public
about it...

518
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:45,045
Oh, yes?

519
00:29:45,205 --> 00:29:46,765
He put me in an impossible position.

520
00:29:46,925 --> 00:29:48,365
Oh, you f... What?

521
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:50,205
Oh, I was blackmailing you?

522
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:54,565
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, I was
blackmailing you. Jesus Christ.

523
00:29:54,725 --> 00:29:58,805
..brought us closer
than we've been in many years.

524
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:23,125
Up, around...

525
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:43,325
Red.

526
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:47,245
House looks lovely.

527
00:30:48,285 --> 00:30:49,845
Cleaver.

528
00:30:50,845 --> 00:30:52,645
You look great.

529
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,325
Thank you.

530
00:30:55,485 --> 00:30:57,965
The present table's outside.

531
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:00,685
Drinks are out there too.

532
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:04,965
Hey, uh, I was wondering
if we could have a little chat.

533
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:07,885
Oh?

534
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:10,365
Well, it's been a while.

535
00:31:11,365 --> 00:31:13,285
Today's not the best day.

536
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:17,205
Of course.

537
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:28,365
Before entering the castle,
you must be wearing one of these.

538
00:31:28,525 --> 00:31:31,485
Now, there can be no more
than two persons

539
00:31:31,645 --> 00:31:34,045
in the castle at any one time...

540
00:31:41,685 --> 00:31:43,325
What I care about, Cleaver,

541
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:47,085
is what kind of job the premier's doing,
not who she's screwing.

542
00:31:47,245 --> 00:31:49,325
Yeah, but there still remains
a question about her judgement.

543
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:51,405
You know, it's a bit like
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.

544
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:53,165
Ah, I guess.

545
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:55,085
Yeah, and you're Monica, Cleaver.

546
00:31:55,245 --> 00:31:57,805
Yes, yes, I got that one.

547
00:31:57,965 --> 00:32:00,085
Yeah, you're the girl underneath
the president's desk, right?

548
00:32:00,245 --> 00:32:02,365
I imagine that it was
a thrill at the time,

549
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:04,805
but has it not left
a stain on your soul?

550
00:32:05,805 --> 00:32:07,485
Oh...

551
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:10,045
People are entitled
to their own private lives.

552
00:32:10,205 --> 00:32:11,565
Correct.

553
00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:14,645
I'm not about to judge you.
I'm not about to judge the premier.

554
00:32:14,805 --> 00:32:16,165
I say live and let live.

555
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:18,845
But you do know there's
a spiritual dimension to all this.

556
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:22,405
Infidelity's a mortal sin.
Correct.

557
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,085
Put the two together, we're gonna
shake them about, shake it about.

558
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:27,245
The birthday boy's
gonna give it a blow.

559
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:29,365
And then a one and a two
and a... Whoa!

560
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:35,485
You guys have been wonderful.
You've been so good. Happy birthday.

561
00:32:35,645 --> 00:32:38,525
Time for
pirate fairy bread.

562
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:44,645
That was terrific, mate.
Thanks. Well done.

563
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:47,325
Oh, cheers. Yeah, yeah. Well,
they're a lovely bunch of kids.

564
00:32:49,045 --> 00:32:50,365
You fancy a beer?

565
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:52,285
Uh... Oh, I shouldn't.

566
00:32:52,445 --> 00:32:54,965
But, uh...

567
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:56,725
Oh, what the hell? Yeah, yeah.

568
00:32:56,885 --> 00:32:59,085
You wouldn't happen to have
any vodka, would you, mate?

569
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:02,045
Yeah, sure.

570
00:33:02,205 --> 00:33:04,645
Great.
Won't be long.

571
00:33:04,805 --> 00:33:09,645
I mean... mean, sometimes
they don't give you anything.

572
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:12,405
And I'm not just
talking about a tip, right?

573
00:33:12,565 --> 00:33:17,165
And it's not like I'm charging
a fortune, am I, Bernie?

574
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:19,405
No, you're not. No.
And it was a really great show.

575
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:24,925
And...and I'm not just another idiot
actor trying to make ends meet.

576
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:30,405
I give these kids the best two hours
they've ever had in their lives...

577
00:33:30,565 --> 00:33:32,005
..in their entire fucking lives...

578
00:33:32,165 --> 00:33:33,725
Hey!
Hey, mate, mind your language.

579
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:36,125
Whoa, no.
There's kids.

580
00:33:36,285 --> 00:33:38,965
You should hear the way
some of the parents talk to me.

581
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:41,005
Wait for it.

582
00:33:42,005 --> 00:33:44,605
“I would've thought
that you brought your own water.”

583
00:33:44,765 --> 00:33:48,005
My own water, mate! Hey?

584
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:52,085
Mate, do I...I know you?

585
00:33:52,245 --> 00:33:55,085
Uh, I don't know.
Have we met at the circus?

586
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:57,565
You're that bloke that's
been rooting the premier.

587
00:33:57,725 --> 00:33:59,205
Oh, mate, hey.
Aren't ya, hey?

588
00:33:59,365 --> 00:34:00,845
Language, mate.
Are you a Tory, mate?

589
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:03,125
Not since I had
my haemorrhoids attended to.

590
00:34:03,285 --> 00:34:04,445
Cleaver!

591
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:06,165
How can you fucking look yourself
in the mirror?

592
00:34:06,325 --> 00:34:07,645
Mate, mate, the language.
What?

593
00:34:07,805 --> 00:34:09,725
After what she's done to this state...
She's raped it!

594
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:11,205
Hey, knock it off!
Your language, mate.

595
00:34:11,365 --> 00:34:13,485
Be that as it may...
Be what as it may, mate?

596
00:34:13,645 --> 00:34:15,005
Alright, you want the truth?
Yeah.

597
00:34:15,165 --> 00:34:17,085
Leave it.
Yes? Right-wing chicks are hot.

598
00:34:17,245 --> 00:34:18,405
Don't.
I beg your pardon?

599
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:20,925
Much hotter than left-wing chicks.
You know why that is?

600
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:22,645
Because right-wing chicks

601
00:34:22,805 --> 00:34:27,725
are aggressively carnivorous,
self-reliant, Ayn Rand acolytes

602
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:29,365
who understand
the value of the moment.

603
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,525
Hey, Cleave...

604
00:34:30,685 --> 00:34:33,085
They get that sex
is something in and of itself,

605
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:34,725
beholden to nothing and no-one

606
00:34:34,885 --> 00:34:36,205
and as a consequence
of that understanding

607
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,605
they're less inhibited
and therefore hornier.

608
00:34:38,765 --> 00:34:40,725
Left-wing chicks, on the other hand,

609
00:34:40,885 --> 00:34:43,485
they're vegans who want
a holistic experience,

610
00:34:43,645 --> 00:34:45,325
they're all about context,

611
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:47,925
they talk about an orgasm
like it's a pet spaniel

612
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,725
and so consequently
the moment's ruined.

613
00:34:49,885 --> 00:34:53,485
And this, Mr Clown, is the real reason
why the left has carked it —

614
00:34:53,645 --> 00:34:55,565
because the right
is constantly procreating

615
00:34:55,725 --> 00:34:57,725
while the left
is grooming a dead dog.

616
00:34:58,725 --> 00:35:00,485
My mother was a communist.

617
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:02,725
Oh, so you're adopted.
You fuck!

618
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:32,085
Just go.

619
00:35:48,765 --> 00:35:50,845
The clown was drunk.

620
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:08,405
..though
it was torture emotionally.

621
00:36:08,565 --> 00:36:11,765
I was full of guilt and remorse

622
00:36:11,925 --> 00:36:14,205
and when I told Cleaver
I had to break it off

623
00:36:14,365 --> 00:36:16,565
he threatened to go public about it
and ruin my career.

624
00:36:16,725 --> 00:36:19,005
He put me in
an impossible position...

625
00:36:19,165 --> 00:36:20,525
Oh, God.

626
00:36:20,685 --> 00:36:24,885
It was fantastic dirty sex,
pure and simple.

627
00:36:25,045 --> 00:36:26,605
That's how she wanted it.

628
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:29,205
No infatuation,
no longing, no love.

629
00:36:29,365 --> 00:36:31,045
I mean, it just seems
incredible to me

630
00:36:31,205 --> 00:36:32,645
that people are buying her crap.

631
00:36:32,805 --> 00:36:34,485
The press has done nothing

632
00:36:34,645 --> 00:36:36,925
but call the premier
on all of her broken promises.

633
00:36:37,085 --> 00:36:40,125
Every day in the papers
you guys have got a list of them.

634
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:43,245
And yet now because of a couple
of Academy Award-worthy performances

635
00:36:43,405 --> 00:36:45,045
from the premier and Mr Streep

636
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:46,845
suddenly she's Abraham Lincoln.

637
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:49,925
Well, here's the real scoop, Richard.

638
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:52,525
The premier and her husband

639
00:36:52,685 --> 00:36:56,325
can barely stand being
in the same parliament together,

640
00:36:56,485 --> 00:36:57,845
let alone the same bed.

641
00:36:58,005 --> 00:36:59,725
Do you have any proof of that?

642
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:05,925
Well, you know, the premier is a big fan
of the text message. BIG fan.

643
00:37:06,085 --> 00:37:07,965
As am I, I have to say.

644
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,605
And I'm just scrolling through
my messages as we speak.

645
00:37:11,765 --> 00:37:15,205
OK, here's one from
the 4th of this month.

646
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:19,765
Quote — “Skiddy boring punters
to death at dinner in Newcastle.

647
00:37:19,925 --> 00:37:23,285
“Hook up? Urgent need
to get down and dirty.”

648
00:37:23,445 --> 00:37:27,605
Then she signs off, “XXX-rated.”
Shit!

649
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:29,685
Do you know who ‘Skiddy' is, Richard?
Shut up!

650
00:37:29,845 --> 00:37:31,645
Skiddy is the premier's husband,

651
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:33,965
the Attorney-General
and Police Minister of this state.

652
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:37,565
She calls him ‘the Skidmark' behind
his back, or ‘Skiddy' for short.

653
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:39,285
How's that for terms of endearment?

654
00:37:39,445 --> 00:37:42,125
Cleaver Greene, are you saying
that is a text message

655
00:37:42,285 --> 00:37:43,605
to you from the premier?

656
00:37:43,765 --> 00:37:45,485
Yes, I am absolutely saying that

657
00:37:45,645 --> 00:37:49,565
and I am saying that
I have got dozens like it.

658
00:37:51,205 --> 00:37:53,725
You sent him dirty texts?

659
00:37:53,885 --> 00:37:56,525
Jesus fucking Christ!

660
00:37:56,685 --> 00:37:59,245
Has Shane Warne
taught you nothing, Claudia?

661
00:38:01,885 --> 00:38:03,365
Claude?!

662
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:07,285
Claude, I'm not sure
there's a way around this.

663
00:38:07,445 --> 00:38:09,325
Oh, of course there's
a fucking way around this!

664
00:38:09,485 --> 00:38:10,965
There's always a fucking way
around everything

665
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,605
because that's what we do,
don't we, Cal?

666
00:38:13,765 --> 00:38:15,965
That's how we spend our time,

667
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:20,165
consume our careers and lives
finding ways round things!

668
00:38:25,725 --> 00:38:28,525
Do you remember when
you told me to run, Cal?

669
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:32,645
You were groping my arse
at Nick's birthday.

670
00:38:32,805 --> 00:38:36,885
I thought it was all about
the ideas back then.

671
00:38:37,045 --> 00:38:40,045
Fuck.

672
00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:44,165
It seemed so obvious how to make
other people's lives better.

673
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:48,045
The next day I said,
“Yeah, sure, I'll run.”

674
00:38:48,205 --> 00:38:52,245
Then you left Grace
and we got married.

675
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:56,645
But that's the last time
we talked about ideas

676
00:38:56,805 --> 00:38:58,205
and from that day on

677
00:38:58,365 --> 00:39:01,045
it's just been running
and winning and running and...

678
00:39:02,285 --> 00:39:04,725
Well, you gotta be invited
to the dance, darling...

679
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:07,045
I've been invited
to the fucking dance, Cal!

680
00:39:07,205 --> 00:39:09,445
I'm queen of the fucking prom

681
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:12,565
and I haven't had a chance
to do a single move of my own.

682
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,885
I've just been running
and winning and...

683
00:39:19,285 --> 00:39:21,845
What happened to the ideas?

684
00:39:26,885 --> 00:39:29,765
It's too late for ideas.

685
00:39:30,965 --> 00:39:32,885
I know.

686
00:39:37,525 --> 00:39:38,965
I'll deal with Greene.

687
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,325
Hm, good.

688
00:39:55,525 --> 00:39:58,005
I never attempted
to blackmail the premier.

689
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:01,805
I never threatened to go
public about our relationship, OK?

690
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:05,445
I never threatened her
in any way at all. She's lying.

691
00:40:05,605 --> 00:40:08,765
She never tried to break it off

692
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:12,325
and I never said I would
go public if she did.

693
00:40:12,485 --> 00:40:14,165
You don't have a case for blackmail.

694
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:15,645
Cleave, like I said,

695
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:17,605
no-one's charging you
with anything at this point.

696
00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:19,205
These are simply
preliminary enquiries.

697
00:40:19,365 --> 00:40:22,565
Well, you know what? I actually
wouldn't mind being charged, Murph.

698
00:40:22,725 --> 00:40:24,285
I actually would like to see

699
00:40:24,445 --> 00:40:27,245
this whole fucking nightmare
played out in court.

700
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:32,245
You know why? I'd win
because I have the texts.

701
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:36,965
OK, this is not my phone.

702
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,605
What do you mean?

703
00:40:40,245 --> 00:40:41,565
It's not my phone.

704
00:40:41,725 --> 00:40:44,085
Sure you picked up the right one
after you came through security?

705
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:45,725
It was pretty crowded down there.

706
00:40:46,765 --> 00:40:48,125
You're fucking kidding me.

707
00:40:48,285 --> 00:40:51,965
Hey, relax, Cleave. If your phone
is here, we'll find it.

708
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:55,565
You're sure that's your phone?
Yes!

709
00:40:55,725 --> 00:40:57,365
And the texts?
What do you reckon, Barn?

710
00:40:57,525 --> 00:41:00,085
All gone, every one of them wiped.

711
00:41:00,245 --> 00:41:03,365
Pricks! This is Cal McGregor.
Alright, mate, calm down.

712
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:04,845
Fuck!
Mate!

713
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,925
You're gonna have to write me
an affidavit in support.

714
00:41:07,085 --> 00:41:08,405
In support of what?

715
00:41:08,565 --> 00:41:10,365
You're the only other person
who's seen the texts.

716
00:41:10,525 --> 00:41:12,245
I haven't seen them.
You told me about them.

717
00:41:12,405 --> 00:41:13,725
Yes, I read them out to you.

718
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:17,085
You read out two. I didn't see them.
I can't say I saw them, Cleave.

719
00:41:17,245 --> 00:41:19,685
What? You don't believe me?
It's not about that.

720
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:21,245
Look, mate, I've got a conference.

721
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:25,605
Barney, I'm being attacked by every
level of the system right now.

722
00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:28,365
I will happily put in an affidavit
saying what you told me,

723
00:41:28,525 --> 00:41:31,165
but I cannot and will not
perjure myself, OK?

724
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:33,845
You know the texts exist!
I'm not asking you to lie.

725
00:41:34,005 --> 00:41:37,645
Yes, you are, Cleaver!
You just don't get it, do you?

726
00:41:37,805 --> 00:41:39,805
I've got a conference.

727
00:41:41,005 --> 00:41:43,165
Come.

728
00:41:45,245 --> 00:41:46,925
This just came for you.

729
00:41:47,085 --> 00:41:49,285
Oh, ta.

730
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:54,565
Latte?

731
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:57,845
Uh, no, no. I'm good.

732
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:03,165
My father never came
to any sports days.

733
00:42:03,325 --> 00:42:09,285
He never showed any emotions...
let alone affection.

734
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:10,925
He was like this iceberg...

735
00:42:11,085 --> 00:42:13,085
Barney, um, I'm sorry to interrupt,

736
00:42:13,245 --> 00:42:16,485
but do you really think this has
something to do with your father?

737
00:42:17,485 --> 00:42:18,805
Sorry?

738
00:42:18,965 --> 00:42:22,205
‘Cause let me tell you, it has nothing
to do with your father.

739
00:42:22,365 --> 00:42:24,005
Doesn't it?
No.

740
00:42:24,165 --> 00:42:26,485
Nor does it have anything
to do with Scarlet's mother.

741
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:28,485
They're sideshows, Barney.

742
00:42:28,645 --> 00:42:30,645
Really?

743
00:42:30,805 --> 00:42:32,605
These are my notes on you guys,

744
00:42:32,765 --> 00:42:35,725
all our sessions,
couples and one-on-one.

745
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:37,965
I did an audit this morning.

746
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:40,405
And...?
Well...

747
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:42,965
Barney, I've never said this
before in my life

748
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:45,285
to a patient, a colleague, anyone.

749
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:49,005
In fact, I could be deregistered
for what I'm about to say.

750
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:51,125
But forget Mummy and Daddy, OK?

751
00:42:51,285 --> 00:42:53,565
The problem you and Scarlet
are confronting —

752
00:42:53,725 --> 00:42:55,925
both as individuals
and in terms of your marriage —

753
00:42:56,085 --> 00:43:00,365
is so absurdly obvious
I don't know what else to say.

754
00:43:00,525 --> 00:43:01,845
Go on.

755
00:43:02,005 --> 00:43:05,325
It's Cleaver Greene.

756
00:43:08,525 --> 00:43:10,845
Jesus Christ.

757
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,845
She's in free fall, mate.
I've never seen anything like it.

758
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:17,205
57% of the New South Wales public

759
00:43:17,365 --> 00:43:21,925
think that Cleaver Greene is
more trustworthy than the premier?

760
00:43:22,085 --> 00:43:23,645
I mean, that can't
possibly be right.

761
00:43:23,805 --> 00:43:25,125
Not only that.

762
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:29,445
69% think the blackmail allegations
are politically motivated.

763
00:43:31,365 --> 00:43:32,885
So what are my options?

764
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:35,725
Dump Claude and you'll get
an eight-point bounce.

765
00:43:36,725 --> 00:43:38,405
When you say dump her,

766
00:43:38,565 --> 00:43:40,965
do you mean politically
or personally?

767
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:43,605
Both.

768
00:43:46,965 --> 00:43:50,365
Which I could only do if...

769
00:43:51,725 --> 00:43:54,165
..I was shocked to find out

770
00:43:54,325 --> 00:43:56,605
that Cleaver's side of the story
was the truth.

771
00:43:56,765 --> 00:43:58,085
Shocking
though that would be.

772
00:43:58,245 --> 00:43:59,565
Shocking.
Shocking.

773
00:43:59,725 --> 00:44:01,285
It's not enough
to get you the leadership,

774
00:44:01,445 --> 00:44:04,165
but it's enough to give you some
wiggle room with Stevie or Bill

775
00:44:04,325 --> 00:44:06,285
if you wanna hang on
to AGs and Police.

776
00:44:07,285 --> 00:44:08,965
Hmm.

777
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,805
Oh, it's a pity...

778
00:44:10,965 --> 00:44:12,845
..about not pursuing
the charges against Greene.

779
00:44:13,005 --> 00:44:16,005
It was the one thing I was
looking forward to this week.

780
00:44:25,765 --> 00:44:28,485
Yeah, g'day, Stevie.
How are you, mate?

781
00:44:28,645 --> 00:44:31,085
Look, I've just happened upon a file

782
00:44:31,245 --> 00:44:34,965
of text messages between Claude
and Cleaver Greene and, uh...

783
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:39,045
Well, quite frankly, I'm...I'm at a loss
as to what to do with them.

784
00:44:41,085 --> 00:44:43,965
Well, I'd be grateful
for your advice, mate,

785
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:49,685
because there's every possibility
that tomorrow you could be premier.

786
00:44:49,845 --> 00:44:54,965
So, Dr Fisher, how would you describe
this mixture of materials?

787
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,885
Lethal as a combination, obviously.

788
00:44:57,045 --> 00:45:01,685
And what can you tell us about the
mechanical components of the bomb?

789
00:45:01,845 --> 00:45:03,845
Uh, pretty standard, really.

790
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:07,045
Basic shrapnel — nails primarily.

791
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:11,125
It's not usual in such a case
to find evidence of remote detonation,

792
00:45:11,285 --> 00:45:12,605
but that's always a possibility.

793
00:45:12,765 --> 00:45:18,645
I'm sorry. You found evidence
of potential remote detonation?

794
00:45:18,805 --> 00:45:20,005
Yes.

795
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:23,685
Is that usual in such a bomb?

796
00:45:23,845 --> 00:45:27,485
I mean, my understanding
is that in cases like this

797
00:45:27,645 --> 00:45:30,045
the bombs are usually self-detonated.

798
00:45:30,205 --> 00:45:32,005
Well, sometimes
there's a fail-safe —

799
00:45:32,165 --> 00:45:34,565
if the bomber is incapacitated,

800
00:45:34,725 --> 00:45:37,085
then the detonator can still
be triggered by somebody else.

801
00:45:37,245 --> 00:45:41,245
So, Dr Fisher,
could this remote detonation

802
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,965
have been triggered
by a mobile phone call?

803
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:46,485
That's a common method, yes.

804
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:51,565
Get Zuharah's mobile bills.

805
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:59,405
Dr Fisher, if the objective was
to blow up Parliament House,

806
00:45:59,565 --> 00:46:02,685
this was an amateurish joke
of an attempt, wasn't it?

807
00:46:02,845 --> 00:46:05,605
I would never describe such intentions
as jokes, Mr Greene.

808
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:09,085
How big was the bomb, Dr Fisher?

809
00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:12,125
For anyone else to have been
seriously injured or killed

810
00:46:12,285 --> 00:46:13,685
they would've had to be standing

811
00:46:13,845 --> 00:46:15,445
shoulder-to-shoulder
with Mr Mohammed.

812
00:46:15,605 --> 00:46:19,565
Really? So then the damage to
Parliament itself would have been...?

813
00:46:19,725 --> 00:46:21,725
Negligible.

814
00:46:21,885 --> 00:46:23,965
Mr Greene?

815
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:25,885
Uh, one moment, Your Honour.

816
00:46:26,045 --> 00:46:28,285
Very well.

817
00:46:31,245 --> 00:46:33,445
Uh, no further questions,
Your Honour,

818
00:46:33,605 --> 00:46:36,725
but at this point
I would like to tender

819
00:46:36,885 --> 00:46:40,845
my client's mobile phone records
for the relevant period.

820
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:46,485
You'll note that my client sent
no text messages on that morning

821
00:46:46,645 --> 00:46:48,325
and made only one phone call,

822
00:46:48,485 --> 00:46:50,125
which was apparently to her dentist

823
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:52,205
to make an appointment
for one of her daughters.

824
00:46:52,365 --> 00:46:54,485
This doesn't preclude
the possibility

825
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,725
that Mrs Mohammed purchased
another SIM card

826
00:46:56,885 --> 00:46:58,405
in order to detonate the bomb.

827
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,885
Well, then, Your Honour,

828
00:47:00,045 --> 00:47:02,605
we would be keen to see
evidence of such a purchase.

829
00:47:02,765 --> 00:47:06,645
Your Honour, I seek an adjournment
so we can make proper inquiries.

830
00:47:06,805 --> 00:47:09,005
Your Honour,
what inquiries?

831
00:47:09,165 --> 00:47:10,685
You can get a SIM card

832
00:47:10,845 --> 00:47:13,645
with any packet of breakfast cereal
these days.

833
00:47:13,805 --> 00:47:15,245
The things are a dime a dozen.

834
00:47:15,405 --> 00:47:19,205
And you will recall, Your Honour,
that my client's home was raided.

835
00:47:19,365 --> 00:47:22,445
Her computer and documents
have been seized.

836
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:25,685
The Crown has had ample opportunity

837
00:47:25,845 --> 00:47:28,965
to furnish us with such evidence
if indeed it did exist.

838
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:30,925
It clearly does not.

839
00:47:32,685 --> 00:47:34,365
I agree, Mr Greene.

840
00:47:37,965 --> 00:47:41,485
There are no witnesses,
ladies and gentlemen.

841
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:46,845
My client's only possible
substantive connection with this crime

842
00:47:47,005 --> 00:47:48,925
is that she purchased some chemicals

843
00:47:49,085 --> 00:47:51,565
which MAY have been
used to make the bomb —

844
00:47:51,725 --> 00:47:53,445
chemicals, I might add,

845
00:47:53,605 --> 00:47:57,325
which any of us could
purchase this very afternoon.

846
00:47:58,325 --> 00:48:01,925
But do you know what the worst thing is
about the prosecution's case?

847
00:48:02,085 --> 00:48:06,885
It is a case
that is rooted in prejudice.

848
00:48:07,045 --> 00:48:10,045
Had Mr Mohammed
not converted to Islam,

849
00:48:10,205 --> 00:48:14,685
but had it have been old Mike Coorey
who'd blown himself up on that day,

850
00:48:14,845 --> 00:48:17,805
this case would never be being tried
as an act of terrorism.

851
00:48:17,965 --> 00:48:19,765
This would be a case

852
00:48:19,925 --> 00:48:23,085
about a sad, mentally ill guy

853
00:48:23,245 --> 00:48:25,245
who'd gone postal.

854
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:29,085
The forensic evidence
proves beyond reasonable doubt

855
00:48:29,245 --> 00:48:34,405
that had Mr Mohammed walked down
Macquarie Street with a cricket bat,

856
00:48:34,565 --> 00:48:38,685
he would have been
better placed to take life.

857
00:48:38,845 --> 00:48:41,005
The device
in Mr Mohammed's backpack

858
00:48:41,165 --> 00:48:45,405
was only ever going
to kill one person...

859
00:48:50,005 --> 00:48:52,485
Uh, Mr Greene?

860
00:48:55,485 --> 00:48:57,285
Yes, Your Honour.

861
00:48:57,445 --> 00:48:59,605
I was merely restating the point

862
00:48:59,765 --> 00:49:03,445
that the device that
Mr Mohammed was carrying

863
00:49:03,605 --> 00:49:09,045
was...was patently inadequate
for its alleged purpose.

864
00:49:12,605 --> 00:49:16,005
This just arrived,
marked ‘Private and Confidential'.

865
00:49:17,005 --> 00:49:21,005
And we've just heard —
Greene got the terrorist off.

866
00:49:22,005 --> 00:49:25,045
Of course he did. Thanks.

867
00:49:44,685 --> 00:49:47,045
We're very pleased for you.

868
00:49:47,205 --> 00:49:48,765
Excuse me.

869
00:49:49,765 --> 00:49:51,645
Hi, mate. Yeah, yeah.

870
00:49:51,805 --> 00:49:55,445
It must be
a gratifying and rare experience

871
00:49:55,605 --> 00:49:59,325
to have a genuinely
innocent client acquitted.

872
00:49:59,485 --> 00:50:01,805
Yes, well, you're no terrorist.
That's for sure.

873
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:05,645
This was just plain
old-fashioned murder, wasn't it?

874
00:50:05,805 --> 00:50:07,605
I beg your pardon?

875
00:50:07,765 --> 00:50:09,605
You sent your husband
out on a mission

876
00:50:09,765 --> 00:50:13,085
that could only ever have one result.

877
00:50:13,245 --> 00:50:15,685
Not only was there barely enough
explosive to kill him,

878
00:50:15,845 --> 00:50:18,405
but you were able to detonate it
before he hit Macquarie Street.

879
00:50:18,565 --> 00:50:21,045
Whatever he believed
he was doing,

880
00:50:21,205 --> 00:50:24,485
there was only ever one target
and that was your husband.

881
00:50:24,645 --> 00:50:28,845
The genius of it, the bit I love,
is the gall of it —

882
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:31,365
playing to our prejudices,

883
00:50:31,525 --> 00:50:35,085
hiding a big crime
inside a much bigger crime,

884
00:50:35,245 --> 00:50:37,085
knowing you'd be
labelled a terrorist

885
00:50:37,245 --> 00:50:38,885
instead of a husband killer.

886
00:50:39,045 --> 00:50:41,365
An absurd fiction, Mr Greene.

887
00:50:41,525 --> 00:50:43,085
Here you were,

888
00:50:43,245 --> 00:50:46,245
stuck with this moron who wanted
to go out and blow people up,

889
00:50:46,405 --> 00:50:49,565
who was filling your daughters' heads
full of ideas that you despised,

890
00:50:49,725 --> 00:50:54,605
an insufferable fool
who you couldn't divorce.

891
00:50:54,765 --> 00:50:57,365
I had a great-uncle
who used to say

892
00:50:57,525 --> 00:51:01,085
there was only ever one way
to truly end a marriage.

893
00:51:02,445 --> 00:51:03,925
But I'm sure Western society

894
00:51:04,085 --> 00:51:07,445
has come to a much more sophisticated
and happy means

895
00:51:07,605 --> 00:51:09,285
of settling such matters.

896
00:51:13,525 --> 00:51:15,205
Thank you, Mr Greene.

897
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:17,565
Please send your account
to the house.

898
00:51:17,725 --> 00:51:20,485
My best wishes to your family.

899
00:51:25,725 --> 00:51:29,445
Mr Speaker, I have here transcripts

900
00:51:29,605 --> 00:51:34,965
of text messages between
the premier and Mr Cleaver Greene.

901
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:38,885
They are dated and timed.

902
00:51:39,045 --> 00:51:40,805
I seek leave to table
these transcripts

903
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:42,885
so that the premier may respond.

904
00:51:43,045 --> 00:51:49,605
Might I add that these are every bit as
shabby as one might have expected.

905
00:51:49,765 --> 00:51:51,565
Every bit as shabby, Mr Speaker!

906
00:51:51,725 --> 00:51:54,165
Have a look, Premier!

907
00:51:54,325 --> 00:51:56,365
They're right here.
They're in your own words.

908
00:51:56,525 --> 00:51:58,325
No? No?

909
00:51:58,485 --> 00:52:00,165
She won't even have a look.

910
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,485
Won't even have a look!

911
00:52:06,725 --> 00:52:09,845
- Order! Order!
- Resign, resign, resign!

912
00:52:10,845 --> 00:52:13,725
Order! Order!

913
00:52:25,805 --> 00:52:27,565
Beer?

914
00:52:28,885 --> 00:52:30,605
I'm pulling the plug, mate.

915
00:52:30,765 --> 00:52:33,565
On what?
You and me.

916
00:52:33,725 --> 00:52:37,005
What did I do this... Oh, come on.
Mate, the clown got pissed.

917
00:52:37,165 --> 00:52:39,765
Cleave, it's...it's too hard, mate.

918
00:52:40,765 --> 00:52:44,445
This is Scarlet, isn't it?
Yes, in part, but it's me too.

919
00:52:44,605 --> 00:52:46,485
I've come to a fork in the road.

920
00:52:46,645 --> 00:52:48,285
Yeah, or a knife in the back, mate.

921
00:52:48,445 --> 00:52:50,165
Or a runcible spoon
up the arse maybe.

922
00:52:50,325 --> 00:52:52,045
Getting theatrical's not gonna help.

923
00:52:52,205 --> 00:52:55,005
If I have to choose between you
and my family, I'll choose my family...

924
00:52:55,165 --> 00:52:57,125
I don't see why
there has to be a choice.

925
00:52:57,285 --> 00:52:59,925
Alright, we've had
our ups and downs, but...

926
00:53:00,085 --> 00:53:01,685
Is that some sort of joke?

927
00:53:02,685 --> 00:53:05,285
Cleave, it has to be this way.

928
00:53:25,045 --> 00:53:26,645
Cal.

929
00:53:26,805 --> 00:53:30,205
Hey, Cleave. It's been a while.

930
00:53:31,285 --> 00:53:33,845
Oh, it doesn't feel that long.

931
00:53:35,405 --> 00:53:38,125
Jesus, you're a slippery bastard.

932
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:41,925
Every time I thought I...
What can I do for you, Skiddy?

933
00:53:44,845 --> 00:53:46,325
The Drug Squad's received a tip-off

934
00:53:46,485 --> 00:53:48,525
suggesting there may be
a trafficable amount

935
00:53:48,685 --> 00:53:52,165
of a proscribed substance
somewhere in this vicinity.

936
00:53:53,165 --> 00:53:56,445
And by ‘vicinity',
I mean this apartment.

937
00:53:56,605 --> 00:53:59,405
And by ‘prescribed substance',

938
00:53:59,565 --> 00:54:03,245
I mean the 50 bags of coke
I've just hidden here.

939
00:54:04,245 --> 00:54:09,205
Yeah, they should be here
in about 10... Oh, maybe 9 minutes.

940
00:54:09,365 --> 00:54:12,445
So if I were you...

941
00:54:13,445 --> 00:54:16,485
..I'd probably do
the first few bags I found

942
00:54:16,645 --> 00:54:19,445
‘cause they're gonna be your last.

943
00:54:28,925 --> 00:54:30,805
Oh...

944
