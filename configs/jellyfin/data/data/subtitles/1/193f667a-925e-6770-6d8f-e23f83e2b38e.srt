1
00:00:02,365 --> 00:00:04,925
For the love of Judith Christ, mate.

2
00:00:05,045 --> 00:00:06,925
Do we have to have
this conversation again?

3
00:00:07,045 --> 00:00:08,605
Hartford, Styles and Menzies?

4
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:12,445
That's not a fucking appeal,
but that's an inquisition.

5
00:00:12,565 --> 00:00:15,965
A lot of people in your situation
can find the loss of an appeal

6
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:18,165
more devastating than
the initial conviction.

7
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,245
Not with my parole hearing coming up.

8
00:00:20,365 --> 00:00:22,765
The Parole Board
does love a little bit of repentance.

9
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:25,365
Good thing I wrote that
in the guidelines, eh?

10
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,965
Arrgh! Fuck. Oh...

11
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:31,565
I want to sing, Cleave.
That's what I want to do.

12
00:00:31,685 --> 00:00:33,885
You're thick with the...
the Chief, aren't you?

13
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:35,805
Yes, but maybe not so much now.

14
00:00:35,925 --> 00:00:38,725
Live the dream.
Live the dream, my friend.

15
00:00:38,845 --> 00:00:40,245
There may be a way around this.

16
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:42,925
- What is it?
- Bearbung, Cleaver.

17
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:47,205
- Bearbung.
- Talk to me, Kieran.

18
00:01:26,205 --> 00:01:28,765
Good luck with the appeal, Cleaver.

19
00:01:28,885 --> 00:01:31,605
- See you on the outside, fellas.
- Give 'em hell, Cleave.

20
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,485
Kick him in the nuts for me,
mate.

21
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:35,085
Thanks, fellas.

22
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:46,245
I almost miss him.

23
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:47,725
Always good for a laugh.

24
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:52,165
No, not even in jest.
The man is a coke-addled sexual deviant.

25
00:01:52,285 --> 00:01:56,565
It was you who caught him humping
Beck Nissel in the loo, wasn't it?

26
00:01:56,685 --> 00:02:00,285
No, Mandy, the sister.
Beck was later, in the lift.

27
00:02:00,405 --> 00:02:01,925
Prison is where the man belongs.

28
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:04,445
Oh, heavens, we all agree about that.

29
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:06,685
Oh, God, yes. The only place for him.

30
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:08,285
Hi.

31
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:11,925
No grandstanding in there.

32
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:15,005
Just look humble. Don't be a smart-arse.

33
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,525
I'm... I am St Francis of Assisi.

34
00:02:18,645 --> 00:02:20,725
I am a father unto my flock.

35
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:22,525
Just ordinary, decent.

36
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:24,965
I'll channel Harry 'Sorry' David.

37
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:29,085
You know what? I don't need this.
I am frantically busy.

38
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:31,325
If you want to defend yourself,
here are my notes.

39
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:34,565
Best thing that's going to happen today
is maybe we get a retrial.

40
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:37,245
- There's certainly grounds...
- Hey, Red. What's wrong?

41
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:41,405
OK, I'm sorry. OK.
I'm sorry. Please. Come on, please.

42
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:47,445
I cannot spend any more time in this
fucking shithole waiting for a retrial.

43
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:50,245
Well, what are you expecting today?

44
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,525
My old life. I want it back.

45
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:56,205
I want everything.

46
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:58,685
I want the bar, I want the bars.

47
00:02:58,805 --> 00:03:01,325
I want Barney.

48
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:06,765
I want Sundays with Wendy and Fuzz.
I want my fucking life back.

49
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:10,245
Given the bench,
I wouldn't hope for too much.

50
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:12,645
- Mention Bearbung.
- Bearbung?

51
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:14,605
I'm not citing a case
I know nothing about.

52
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:16,085
Just say it.

53
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:22,645
All rise.

54
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:34,205
In all, there were,
in Judge Walter's summations,

55
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:37,205
some eight clear breaches of law
in his instruction to the jury.

56
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:41,205
Bored, Miss Engels.
You have made this point three times.

57
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:44,525
- And each time, it failed to land.
- Move on.

58
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:47,045
On six occasions, there was a failure...

59
00:03:47,165 --> 00:03:51,565
By the appellant's counsel to present
anything interesting to this court.

60
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:54,045
..to allow admissible evidence.

61
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:57,045
It's difficult to look
at the transcript of this trial

62
00:03:57,165 --> 00:04:01,165
and not query whether there was
some sort of set against the appellant.

63
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:05,365
Miss Engels, if you are
imputing any bias by this bench,

64
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:08,845
you may find yourself
joining the appellant.

65
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:10,485
No, Your Honour.

66
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:14,405
But the appellant
was a prominent Sydney barrister

67
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:17,245
who has now languished in prison
for 11 months

68
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:19,485
when any single one of these
13 instances

69
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:21,565
create clear grounds for a mistrial.

70
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:23,165
Rubbish.

71
00:04:23,285 --> 00:04:25,885
Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish.

72
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:28,125
Could I add, rubbish?

73
00:04:28,245 --> 00:04:30,005
- Bearbung.
- Bearbung.

74
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,605
Bearbung.

75
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:35,845
Can you instruct your client
to stop that?

76
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:38,965
- Has the man Tourette's or something?
- Bearbung.

77
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:43,045
Excuse me, Your Honour.
A slight case thereof.

78
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:47,365
Under stress,
I cough and say the word 'Bearbung.'

79
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:49,085
I have no... Bearbung.

80
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:53,445
I have no idea why,
just a thing since childhood.

81
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:55,125
Excuse me. Bearbung.

82
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:59,365
- I think I've had quite enough.
- Quite agree.

83
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:02,085
Ah, yes.

84
00:05:02,205 --> 00:05:06,845
But before we completely dismiss this,

85
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:14,085
I think I did see something of merit
in one of Miss Engel's points.

86
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:27,805
Fuck!

87
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:32,125
- What just happened in there?
- Fucking Kieran Webster.

88
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:34,205
- He must have told Greene.
- Told him what?

89
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:38,045
I believe it has something to do with
Eddie's retirement plans.

90
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:51,965
What the hell happened in there?
Who or what is Bearbung?

91
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,925
Well, 'bearbung' is an Aboriginal word

92
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:58,605
meaning â€˜an illegally obtained lease
between an appellant judge

93
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,685
and a mining company.'
It's a beautiful word.

94
00:06:00,805 --> 00:06:03,565
- Are you happy with today's result?
- Innocent, boys and girls.

95
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:05,045
Completely innocent.

96
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,405
Three judges with one voice
declared what happened to me

97
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:11,245
an egregious miscarriage of justice.

98
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:14,005
One of them seemed very close to tears.

99
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,165
Will you be seeking compensation?

100
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:18,605
Look, that's all for the future.

101
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:20,765
I just want to spend some quality time

102
00:06:20,885 --> 00:06:23,365
with my family and loved ones,
my friends.

103
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:25,485
Thank you. That'll be all.

104
00:06:26,645 --> 00:06:29,325
I do have family and friends, don't I?

105
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:30,885
You and me!

106
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:34,125
Mates on the inside,
then mates on the out!

107
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:36,005
Who would have thought it?

108
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,125
Yes. How are you, mate?
Thanks for coming.

109
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:42,685
I wouldn't have missed it for nothing.
You should go and be with your family.

110
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:46,445
- Give me a call when you can, hey?
- Alright, mate. Thank you for that.

111
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:48,605
How are you, are you alright?

112
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:50,805
Yeah, I'm good. It's just...

113
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:53,085
No, I'm good. I love you, mate.

114
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,765
Great, great.

115
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:57,245
- I love you, mate.
- Thanks for coming, Mal.

116
00:06:57,365 --> 00:06:59,405
Look after yourself, yeah?

117
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:01,965
Oi!

118
00:07:03,645 --> 00:07:07,805
Isn't there some sort of
celebratory something?

119
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:09,405
Where's Barnyard?

120
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:14,925
Quite a bit has happened
since you went inside.

121
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:16,525
Oh, yeah?

122
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,325
Barney...

123
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:30,685
Barney has cancer.

124
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:35,165
What do you mean?

125
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:36,805
What sort of cancer?

126
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:40,165
Bad cancer?

127
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:42,005
Fuck.

128
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,125
Red...

129
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:45,605
Red?

130
00:07:45,725 --> 00:07:48,605
Fuck! Why didn't somebody tell me?

131
00:07:49,765 --> 00:07:52,085
He must be a mess.

132
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:56,565
Looking marvellous, everybody.

133
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:02,845
And turn.

134
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:05,765
Fantastic, Barney. One more.

135
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:10,005
Barnyard.

136
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:12,525
Hey.

137
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:15,845
You've put on some weight.
Prison must suit you, mate.

138
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:18,445
Forget about me. You!

139
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,725
Scarlet told me - cancer.

140
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:24,605
- Fuck, mate!
- Yeah, of the cods.

141
00:08:24,725 --> 00:08:26,765
- Barney!
- One of them, anyway.

142
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:29,565
- I don't know what to say.
- You know what, mate?

143
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:31,965
It's the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.

144
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:36,005
Every day is a blessing.
I breathe in life, exhale joy.

145
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,165
I can't get enough of my kids.

146
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:42,085
Jilly, tell me you've got one of those
fantastic cream doughnuts.

147
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:44,005
I saved one especially for you.

148
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,045
- You have to try one of these.
- Right.

149
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:47,765
So what did the doctors say?

150
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:51,965
Ah, 50/50. I've got some secondaries
in the old lymphs.

151
00:08:52,085 --> 00:08:55,845
Actually, I'm already a 50.
They've taken one off.

152
00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:57,445
OK, now, slowly.

153
00:08:57,565 --> 00:09:01,085
Feel the way the cream
oozes into the mouth.

154
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:03,085
Don't rush it.

155
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:04,725
Savour!

156
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:07,965
Hm?

157
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:13,845
- What's that?
- That's it - my cancerous testicle.

158
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:16,845
- Oh, Barn!
- Hard to believe all life starts here.

159
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:19,125
- Oh, mate!
- Children come from this.

160
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:21,765
They don't come from a bloody key ring.

161
00:09:21,885 --> 00:09:24,205
It's just an organ!
We eat stuff like this.

162
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:27,045
Nobody wants to look at a ball in aspic.

163
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:29,685
I've been in prison for 11 months
without a woman.

164
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:32,205
In a single moment,
you've put me off sex for another 11.

165
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:33,685
- Come on.
- Jesus.

166
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:37,685
So, come on -
what stage of the treatment are you at?

167
00:09:37,805 --> 00:09:39,685
One more hit of chemo to go.

168
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:43,005
I'm thinking I may not
go back to work, mate, ever.

169
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,285
Ever?

170
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:49,085
Well, sure.
You know, whatever you think.

171
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:55,325
You more than anyone I know
need mental stimulation, don't you?

172
00:09:55,445 --> 00:09:59,885
It would be a shame if
you pulled yourself through all of this

173
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:02,005
and then there was nothing there.

174
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,765
Terrible.

175
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:06,085
But take your time.

176
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,365
Whatever you need.
I'm fine. I'll be alright.

177
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,525
So don't worry about that.

178
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:15,325
I'm, you know,
I'm right back in the game.

179
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:18,205
- You sure the game still wants you?
- They found me innocent.

180
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:21,485
- Acquitted or innocent?
- Yes, yes.

181
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:24,405
So, are you up for a walk?

182
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:26,205
I cycle everywhere now -

183
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,125
fitness and freedom
in the one light-alloy machine.

184
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:31,565
- You can't be serious?
- Never give in to it.

185
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:34,285
- Oh, Barn.
- The trick is, embrace the beast.

186
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:38,405
Trick. It's also a trick
to piss-spell your name in snow.

187
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:41,045
You just end up with yellow slime
on your boots.

188
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:43,725
Trust me - I'm good, Cleave.

189
00:10:43,845 --> 00:10:46,285
It was great to see you.

190
00:10:46,405 --> 00:10:47,925
I'll call you tomorrow.

191
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:53,085
Barn!

192
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:56,925
Thank you.

193
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:02,165
You heard the news, I suppose?

194
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:05,645
Cal McGregor's out
and Cleaver Greene just got acquitted.

195
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:09,925
I heard. Two arseholes released
to make way for most of my front bench.

196
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,285
The big positive
about Les getting jailed

197
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,485
is that it weakens the Right's grip
on the party.

198
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:16,925
So, if we woo Bryce,
we've got the centre alliance

199
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:18,405
and we own Sussex Street.

200
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:21,365
How can there still be factions?
There are 12 of us.

201
00:11:21,485 --> 00:11:23,565
There are still 12 of us, aren't there,
Clayton?

202
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:26,765
Geoff and Alsop are giving their
statements now to the Commission.

203
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:29,045
Both gave me their word
they're not involved.

204
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:31,125
Both made public statements
to that effect.

205
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:33,605
- So all good?
- Alsop should be fine.

206
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:35,805
And Geoff?

207
00:11:35,925 --> 00:11:39,485
Jesus! Is there anyone in this party
not involved in graft?

208
00:11:39,605 --> 00:11:43,245
- That's not rhetorical, by the way.
- You're holding the reins, mate.

209
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:45,205
You've got a 21% approval rating,

210
00:11:45,325 --> 00:11:47,525
which is not bad,
given the state of the party.

211
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:50,845
I wonder how that 21% decided they
like me. I haven't done anything yet.

212
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:52,965
Plus,
the whole gay question's gone away.

213
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:56,365
They think I'm gay
because I support same-sex marriage?

214
00:11:56,485 --> 00:12:00,285
Well, you're not married. Well-groomed.

215
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:01,765
Nice bloke.

216
00:12:01,885 --> 00:12:05,005
And that celebrity prostitute
you were engaged to

217
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:09,285
described you as â€˜honourable'
and 'decent' - all code words.

218
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:36,085
What are you doing here?

219
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:39,365
- I live here.
- No, you live in prison.

220
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:41,045
Oh, sorry.

221
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:42,725
Oh, how great!

222
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,005
The appeal, they actually let you out.

223
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,125
Well, good. That's...
Oh, it's good to see you.

224
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:50,645
Sorry, I wasn't...

225
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:53,965
The general feeling was,
they wouldn't...

226
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:56,405
You remember my mother, Maria?

227
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,205
Hey, Cleave.

228
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:03,885
I could have dinked ya.

229
00:13:06,445 --> 00:13:09,405
There's a very small, bald person.

230
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:12,565
lain Vargas Meagher,
meet Cleaver Greene.

231
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:16,365
Barney, can you... stop that?
That is disgusting.

232
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:19,845
Just reminding the lad
where he came from.

233
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,165
New life, eh, Cleave?

234
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:26,485
I've got to fly. I'm helping out
at the school this arvo.

235
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:30,925
- Oh, sorry.
- That's alright.

236
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:33,685
Right.

237
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:37,845
So, um...

238
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:43,445
You can sleep on the couch tonight.
Mum's a bit of a snorer.

239
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:47,765
You had Barney's baby.

240
00:13:47,885 --> 00:13:52,045
You had a baby with Barney.

241
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,805
With Barney! A b-b-baby.

242
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:58,725
That's the situa...
Is that what has happened here?

243
00:13:58,845 --> 00:14:01,765
The paperwork would indicate
that is the case.

244
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:06,005
OK, so he's lost a ball
and he's fathered a baby?

245
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,845
- Yep.
- And you called the baby 'lan'?

246
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:11,165
It's spelled I-A-I-N.

247
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:13,525
Oh, that makes all the difference -
'Ee-ayn.'

248
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,125
I've got to go, so...

249
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:20,125
So, what? You're off
working for another barrister now?

250
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:21,765
I am living the dream.

251
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:25,645
Of all the things I've heard so far
today, that would surprise me the least.

252
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:33,685
OK. I've got to get a cash flow going.
I've got to get some clients on the go.

253
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:36,685
I've got to get a little space
somewhere else.

254
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:38,565
Like I said, I'm on my way.

255
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:42,085
That's been cut off,
so you'll need to use your mobile.

256
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:43,725
I don't have a mobile!

257
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:47,445
Until a couple of minutes ago,
I was a murderer.

258
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:01,125
Beautiful.

259
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:04,645
Malcolm Finnane?

260
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:07,125
Where's Malcolm Finnane?

261
00:15:07,245 --> 00:15:09,845
- I'm Finnane.
- Look at you.

262
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:15,205
Straight out of deepest, darkest prison.
How long inside, Malcolm?

263
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:17,285
- 17 years.
- Wonderful.

264
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:19,405
- And now on parole?
- Yep.

265
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:24,285
I know I'm being a gay clichÃ©,
but at 3:20am in my cold, little flat,

266
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:26,125
do you know what I thought?

267
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:29,165
- No.
-'I'm listening to the next Susan Boyle

268
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:30,645
except in prison.'

269
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:33,445
You are not to go through that door.

270
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:38,285
I am exercising a super veto card.
No audition - straight to air.

271
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:41,285
The first time our judges hear you
will be on Monday 7th July

272
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:42,765
when all of Australia does.

273
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:47,925
Tuesday, the name
'Malcolm Finnane' will be viral.

274
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:53,325
So I'm on the show?

275
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:55,965
You'll be singing Valjean.
Of course you know the song?

276
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:59,845
Yes, I've heard it, but I was
going to sing the aria from Tosca.

277
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:03,245
Valjean, Les Mis - One Day More.

278
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:06,205
And you and I are friends for eternity.

279
00:16:26,205 --> 00:16:27,685
Bye-bye.

280
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:42,045
Fuzz, this is your old dad.

281
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:45,045
I am a free man, mate.

282
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:47,885
I am cleared of all charges,

283
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:51,525
and I'm hanging out to see you, pal.
Can't wait.

284
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:54,605
I'm going to swing by the house
later on, OK? See ya.

285
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,205
Harley, mate!

286
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,725
Harley!

287
00:17:04,845 --> 00:17:07,565
Cleave! I thought you were in the nick.

288
00:17:07,685 --> 00:17:11,565
The court saw the error of its ways.
What are you up for?

289
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:13,845
- Bit of murder.
- Fantastic.

290
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:17,645
I'm here for you. Give us a call.
Actually, don't call me!

291
00:17:17,765 --> 00:17:21,885
- I'm going to write down my address.
- Mate, I'm seeing someone. Sorry.

292
00:17:23,805 --> 00:17:25,845
Tadpole! What are you up for?

293
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:27,645
Arson. Bye, Cleave.

294
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,765
Oh, yes.

295
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:43,245
Ah!

296
00:17:43,365 --> 00:17:48,445
My client, my secretary,
my best friend's wife.

297
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:49,925
You were in prison.

298
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:54,285
So you decided to steal my secretary
and my entire client base?

299
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:58,645
Your client base?
A rag-bag cluster of low-life sink hair?

300
00:17:58,765 --> 00:18:00,125
Not you, Harley.

301
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,085
Barney referred them to me.

302
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:03,965
Nobody thought to ask me?

303
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:05,965
Why would we need to ask you?

304
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:11,045
These guys need a counsel who could
physically attend a courtroom.

305
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:14,885
I'm sorry - you two, together, in the...

306
00:18:15,005 --> 00:18:19,365
This woman,
she has had your husband's love child.

307
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:23,405
Yes. She and her are well aware of that.

308
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:26,925
What do you want me to do, demonise her?
We've worked through the issues.

309
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:31,445
We sat down and we talked it out.
Maybe you should try it some time.

310
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:34,005
Yeah. We cried and laughed.

311
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:38,445
The fact Barney has cancer
brings us even closer together.

312
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:41,885
We realised we actually like each other.

313
00:18:42,005 --> 00:18:44,045
Best buds, aren't we, Nic?

314
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,885
I've died. I'm in hell.

315
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:49,405
It's a never-ending chick flick.

316
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:51,885
And you!

317
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,845
You and I are family.
I've watched you grow over the years.

318
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:58,285
Three assaults,
one possession of an illegal firearm.

319
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:00,045
Who was there by your side every time?

320
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:01,685
- You were, mate.
- Me.

321
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:03,165
Who talked a judge down

322
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:05,725
from a three-year
to a nine-month suspended sentence?

323
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,405
- You did.
- Me.

324
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:09,805
Who was there for your brother's
first GBH

325
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:12,205
and your cousin's assault
with a deadly weapon?

326
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:16,605
Me, me, me. And now that you get
a decent murder, where are you?

327
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:20,525
Off with somebody else. Well, that's
loyalty, that's friendship for you.

328
00:19:20,645 --> 00:19:22,285
Cleaver, your world is different now.

329
00:19:22,405 --> 00:19:25,165
Harley is completely free
to choose whomever he likes.

330
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:27,565
If he wants to walk back to a man
who has no chambers...

331
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:29,045
No phone.

332
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:32,245
..no standing in the legal world,
then please do so, Harley.

333
00:19:32,365 --> 00:19:35,045
But otherwise,
I've got a meeting to go to.

334
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:38,925
Alright, well, fuck you all very much.

335
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:43,285
And I'll...
I'll be OK to find my own way out.

336
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:45,725
And I do have a phone, by the way.

337
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,805
Gareth, my old friend.

338
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:51,365
Cleaver. Cleaver Greene.

339
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:53,565
Yes. No, out.

340
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:55,445
Out, cleared, innocent.

341
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:57,165
Yeah, OK - quashed.

342
00:19:57,285 --> 00:19:59,285
I'm out, I'm available for work.

343
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:02,765
Cindy, baby. Cleaver Greene.
How are you?

344
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:06,725
Listen, ah, just to say that
if you needed...

345
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:11,365
OK, well, there are other barristers
than her, and I am one of them.

346
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,565
Arrgh!

347
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:19,005
- Shit!
- Damn! Are you alright?

348
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:22,525
Yeah. I just got attacked
by some battleship cruiser.

349
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:27,365
Do you think, just for once,
we could do this in a hotel?

350
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:32,085
This is the only secure place.
Mother doesn't mind, I promise.

351
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:35,965
I mind. This has got to stop.

352
00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:39,525
This is wrong on so many levels.

353
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:42,285
He had a baby with somebody else.

354
00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:43,965
You were going to leave him, then...

355
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:46,365
Yes, then.

356
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:51,805
Until he's either better or...
not, I can't do this anymore,

357
00:20:51,925 --> 00:20:55,845
not with Simon Le Bon looking down on me
and the TV blaring in the next room.

358
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:58,565
I know. Babe, please.

359
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:02,165
I can't live without you. I just...

360
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:06,845
There's someone outside.
I think it's a journo.

361
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,325
Not everyone in the world is a journo.

362
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:10,805
Why would he be interested in

363
00:21:10,925 --> 00:21:13,925
tailing the leader of the world's
smallest opposition party?

364
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:16,725
Have you been talking to Greene
about this?

365
00:21:16,845 --> 00:21:21,605
Yeah. I thought he should know,
and I showed him photos.

366
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:27,685
No, please. Just stick around,
just until I've gone.

367
00:21:29,645 --> 00:21:32,165
Mum really likes you.

368
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:34,325
I love you.

369
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:41,925
Lincoln!

370
00:21:42,045 --> 00:21:43,925
Lincoln, Lincoln!

371
00:21:44,045 --> 00:21:45,405
Mate!

372
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:47,085
I have missed you.

373
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,885
- You're out!
- I'm out.

374
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:51,805
I went to visit you
about half a dozen times.

375
00:21:51,925 --> 00:21:54,125
They said you said, Piss off."

376
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:58,885
And you believed them?
Mate! I was in solitary for four months.

377
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:02,925
I couldn't get a note out.
I'm writing a book about it.

378
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:06,805
Wow. So... are you out on parole?

379
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,845
No, no. I'm free, innocent.

380
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:12,445
Acquitted or quashed?

381
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:16,725
Yeah. So, free for work, huh? Old times.

382
00:22:16,845 --> 00:22:21,165
Oh, no. I've got nothing worthy of you.
I've got tiny stuff.

383
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:24,245
I've got a DUI. The guy wanted
to fight it but I said it's probably...

384
00:22:24,365 --> 00:22:28,965
Oh, come on. If four months in solitary
has taught me anything,

385
00:22:29,085 --> 00:22:33,285
it's that every man must stand
and fight for his rights.

386
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:36,165
Mr McGregor!

387
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:42,925
Let me not keep you good folk
out here in this winter chill.

388
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:47,325
I am genuinely grateful
for my time here.

389
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:51,605
It gave me a chance to reflect

390
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:55,525
and to ask some pretty serious questions
of myself,

391
00:22:55,645 --> 00:23:00,485
I now realise that in my zealousness to
protect the great people of this State,

392
00:23:00,605 --> 00:23:04,405
I lost my own moral compass.

393
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:07,245
Mr McGregor,
one more question before you go.

394
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:10,845
Cal, Cal? So what now?
What for the future?

395
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:16,525
Well, apart from a life of service,
I really haven't given it any thought.

396
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,485
- God bless.
- Thank you, Mr McGregor.

397
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:27,509
http://hiqve.com/

398
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:58,085
God bless you, Mick.

399
00:24:19,565 --> 00:24:23,045
Get me the fuck out of this shithole,
will you?

400
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:27,685
Oh, yeah!

401
00:24:27,805 --> 00:24:29,445
Ah, no.

402
00:24:31,245 --> 00:24:33,085
No speak Polish.

403
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,485
No Polish. No.

404
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:38,885
Sorry. Bye-bye now.

405
00:24:59,885 --> 00:25:02,005
Oh, my God!

406
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,325
Cleave! Oh, your appeal!

407
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:07,565
- You're out!
- Yes. Yes, I'm out.

408
00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:09,845
There's a big for-sale sign.

409
00:25:09,965 --> 00:25:12,725
Yes, you can't stay. As soon as
the bread has finished baking,

410
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,805
we've got to go.
We're open for inspection.

411
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:19,045
- Are we?
- Come and have a quick glass of wine.

412
00:25:19,165 --> 00:25:21,925
- Roger's here?
- Yeah, Roger lives here now.

413
00:25:22,045 --> 00:25:23,805
Oh, Roger lives here now.

414
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:26,365
Where's Fuzz?
Why wasn't he at my bloody appeal?

415
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:28,045
You could have at least sent him.

416
00:25:28,165 --> 00:25:31,325
He might have forgotten.
He's doing this intensive study course.

417
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:33,525
- He's going to work in Africa.
- Hello, Cleaver.

418
00:25:33,645 --> 00:25:36,165
Welcome back to the land of the living.
How was it in there?

419
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:39,045
- Work in Africa?
- He and Tara are going to the Congo

420
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:41,885
to build hospitals and schools
and sing happy hymns.

421
00:25:42,005 --> 00:25:43,885
- He's very committed to it.
- Bloody Congo?

422
00:25:44,005 --> 00:25:46,845
No son of mine
is going to do good works.

423
00:25:46,965 --> 00:25:48,365
What happened to university?

424
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:51,525
- His father went to prison.
- How long have I been asleep?

425
00:25:51,645 --> 00:25:54,965
What happened to the world while I was
inside? I feel like Rumpelstiltskin.

426
00:25:55,085 --> 00:25:58,485
- We sat down as a family and decided...
- What family was this?

427
00:25:58,605 --> 00:26:02,165
Fuzz and myself and Roger and Tara,
we all agreed

428
00:26:02,285 --> 00:26:05,365
that you were too much a part of this
house and we needed to move forward.

429
00:26:05,485 --> 00:26:08,405
Oh, did we?
Did we all have a vote on that?

430
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,445
It was like you were dead, Cleave.

431
00:26:11,565 --> 00:26:16,005
There were too many sad memories
and there was too much shit.

432
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,885
Rip van Winkle.

433
00:26:18,885 --> 00:26:20,245
What?

434
00:26:20,365 --> 00:26:23,645
It was Rip van Winkle
who slept for 100 years.

435
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:26,445
Rumpelstiltskin was the riddle guy.

436
00:26:26,565 --> 00:26:28,805
You're killing me. You know that, Wendy?

437
00:26:28,925 --> 00:26:30,445
I'm not meaning to.

438
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,205
We're getting married, mate.

439
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:45,725
Blow, bugles, blow
Set wild echoes flying

440
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:51,005
Blow, bugles
Answer echoes dying, dying, dying.

441
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:54,645
It was Rip van Winkle.

442
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:24,885
I didn't think
I'd hear from you for days.

443
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:28,405
I thought you'd be doing some
massive family thing.

444
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:32,325
Oh, you know, they all wanted to.
I was keen to keep it low-key.

445
00:27:32,445 --> 00:27:34,245
I've got some news.

446
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:38,125
I followed your advice.
I did that audition thing.

447
00:27:38,245 --> 00:27:41,205
And Tarquin, he heard my tape.
He really liked it.

448
00:27:41,325 --> 00:27:45,605
A turtle listened to your tape?
Oh, no. That's a terrapin.

449
00:27:45,725 --> 00:27:49,045
He reckons I could be some kind of
sensation. I don't really believe him.

450
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:52,765
Would you come?
It would mean a mountain if you did.

451
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:54,965
- Monday the 9th?
- Sure, mate.

452
00:27:55,085 --> 00:27:58,445
Sorry, what are we talking about here?
What did I recommend?

453
00:27:58,565 --> 00:28:02,325
You said I should audition
for Aussies Gotta Sing.

454
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:03,805
- Did I?
- Yeah.

455
00:28:03,925 --> 00:28:07,725
You said, 'If you make your voice heard,
then people will listen.'

456
00:28:07,845 --> 00:28:11,045
You said,
'Follow your dreams, my friend."

457
00:28:11,165 --> 00:28:13,365
Mm. Right.

458
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,645
Sorry, mate - which show is it?

459
00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:20,005
Is it the one where everybody's nice
to you or the one with the arsehole?

460
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,485
Yeah, Gordon.

461
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:22,965
Yeah, he's famous.

462
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:27,405
Increasingly, I hear people are famous.
I've no idea who any of them are.

463
00:28:27,525 --> 00:28:29,565
He had a massive hit - Toledo Mio.

464
00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:33,165
Oh, Gordon Martin, Toledo Mio.

465
00:28:33,285 --> 00:28:36,925
Oh, yes. Early '90s - '92, '93.

466
00:28:37,045 --> 00:28:40,245
Must have charted
for about three minutes in the top ten.

467
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:44,165
Do you really think it's a good idea
to let yourself be judged by this man?

468
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:47,005
You don't think I should do it?
You think it's a mistake?

469
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,205
No, no. No.

470
00:28:49,325 --> 00:28:53,405
Just don't put too much weight
in that clown's opinion.

471
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:56,725
This is it for me, mate.
It's my only way out.

472
00:28:56,845 --> 00:29:00,205
I'm not like you.
You can jump straight back in.

473
00:29:00,325 --> 00:29:04,365
If I can do this, if I can
get a little bit famous, you know?

474
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:07,485
People forgive you, don't they?

475
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:10,885
Yeah.

476
00:29:11,005 --> 00:29:12,605
Yeah!

477
00:29:12,725 --> 00:29:18,205
Fame is the great
get-out-of-jail-free card.

478
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:28,285
If you take away the senseless violence,
fear for your life, man rape,

479
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:30,845
the slammer wasn't so bad, was it?

480
00:29:30,965 --> 00:29:34,045
You know, quiet cell, pleasant company.

481
00:29:34,165 --> 00:29:39,645
I reckon that year with you
was one of the happiest of my life.

482
00:29:39,765 --> 00:29:44,685
Fuck, mate. It hasn't been
all Vogue Living in your life, has it?

483
00:29:44,805 --> 00:29:46,445
Don't do that.

484
00:29:47,565 --> 00:29:49,605
I'll get you another drink.

485
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:06,685
Sh, sh!

486
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,965
Sorry.

487
00:30:09,085 --> 00:30:11,125
Shut up!

488
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:13,325
Thanks a bloody bundle.

489
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,765
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.

490
00:30:15,885 --> 00:30:20,245
There's a new world order.
I'm in Topsy-Turvy Land.

491
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:28,365
No, they're not going to have any sex.

492
00:30:42,645 --> 00:30:44,845
Did you take my mother's phone?

493
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:46,605
What?

494
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:48,285
No!

495
00:30:48,405 --> 00:30:50,525
What does it look like?

496
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:55,485
â™ª Oh, Toledo

497
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:59,605
â™ª Gonna give my baby the heave-ho. â™ª

498
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:26,325
Morning.

499
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:33,965
Ah, Chantelle.

500
00:31:40,885 --> 00:31:43,605
Holy sh... Tikki!

501
00:31:43,725 --> 00:31:46,405
Hello, Cal sweetie.

502
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:48,725
How's the hotel? How were the girls?

503
00:31:48,845 --> 00:31:50,965
Oh. Oh, very good.

504
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:52,725
Thank you, Tikki.

505
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:55,325
I didn't realise you were coming.
Let me get changed.

506
00:31:55,445 --> 00:31:58,725
No! Sit down. Relax.

507
00:31:58,845 --> 00:32:00,205
Alright. Alright.

508
00:32:00,325 --> 00:32:02,525
Lovely to see you
back in the real world.

509
00:32:02,645 --> 00:32:04,925
- Yes.
- So, have you given any thought

510
00:32:05,045 --> 00:32:08,005
to what you might do
now that you're out?

511
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,605
Ah, yes. Yeah. I've got a few plans.

512
00:32:10,725 --> 00:32:12,445
Here's what I think we need you to do.

513
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:16,525
You're going to host a new television
program on one of my cable thingies,

514
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:20,605
and I think you would be adorable.

515
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:24,485
Well! I hadn't really
thought of the media,

516
00:32:24,605 --> 00:32:27,405
but it does seem like a natural fit.

517
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:31,005
A current-affairs,
right-slant newsy thing?

518
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:33,165
Whatever you like, darling.

519
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,485
Bit of a rant,
mostly gambling and scandal.

520
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:38,765
That's what the public needs.

521
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:42,565
I presume
there's strings attached to this?

522
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:45,005
More ropes than strings, pet.

523
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:49,565
I need you to be au fait
with my new business model.

524
00:32:49,685 --> 00:32:52,765
Have you got a dollar coin there, love?

525
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,405
Yeah, yes.

526
00:32:56,605 --> 00:32:59,205
Just pop your one dollar into that.

527
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:03,765
And I give you back, say, 20 cents.

528
00:33:03,885 --> 00:33:05,285
Uh-huh.

529
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:09,685
80 for me, 20 for you.
It's the perfect business model.

530
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:12,285
It's called a casino.

531
00:33:12,405 --> 00:33:15,925
I am currently tendering
to build a new one.

532
00:33:16,045 --> 00:33:19,205
I want to create something magnificent,

533
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:22,085
a great cathedral,

534
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:26,485
where people of all nations,
mainly China and Singapore,

535
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:29,205
come to worship in its chambers.

536
00:33:29,325 --> 00:33:35,485
But I'm copping a lot of flack -
churches and anti-gambling lobbyists.

537
00:33:35,605 --> 00:33:38,245
There's even talk of it being
a sacred site.

538
00:33:38,365 --> 00:33:41,365
How can land on Sydney Harbour
be sacred?

539
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:43,565
The place is a festival of desecration.

540
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:45,045
Exactly.

541
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:47,845
Cal, I want it more than my children.

542
00:33:49,325 --> 00:33:53,525
And I need a brave captain at the helm
to avoid those icebergs.

543
00:33:53,645 --> 00:33:55,005
You are that man.

544
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,605
Come, Jerry.

545
00:33:57,765 --> 00:33:59,645
Right, well, I'm with you, Tikki.

546
00:33:59,765 --> 00:34:03,245
Specifically though,
what do you want me to do?

547
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:05,925
Just follow the bouncing ball, Cal.

548
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:09,245
- Bye, Cal.
- Yeah, bye, Jerry. Good to...

549
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:11,405
..Sâ‚¬ee you.

550
00:34:15,965 --> 00:34:18,005
Glen was three points over.

551
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:21,285
He needs his car for work.

552
00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:23,085
Why are we meeting here?

553
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:28,565
Ah, Glen, I just think that it's a lot
less threatening for my client base

554
00:34:28,685 --> 00:34:31,965
if I meet them here rather than
in my big, showy chambers -

555
00:34:32,085 --> 00:34:33,845
all that marble and so on.

556
00:34:33,965 --> 00:34:37,605
Would you like a coffee?
Maria, if you're not doing anything...

557
00:34:41,165 --> 00:34:45,285
Apparently, the machine's broken again.
Polish machine.

558
00:34:45,405 --> 00:34:47,085
Look, I've been thinking.

559
00:34:47,205 --> 00:34:49,885
This is my third time.
Probably not worth fighting it.

560
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:54,405
Really? If I had that attitude,
I'd still be in prison.

561
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:56,285
So would Mandela.

562
00:34:56,405 --> 00:35:00,085
Some things are worth fighting for,
mate.

563
00:35:00,205 --> 00:35:05,085
All it takes for evil to triumph
is for good men to do nothing.

564
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:07,525
- I was pissed.
- Were you?

565
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:10,445
Are you a doctor?
Did the machine get checked?

566
00:35:10,565 --> 00:35:12,965
Was the reading accurate?
Did you get a blood test?

567
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:15,165
No, I refused. I'm haemophiliac.

568
00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:18,285
Well, there you go.
We need to fight this.

569
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:21,365
I was reading an interesting article
the other day

570
00:35:21,485 --> 00:35:23,605
from this scientist
at the Garrault Institute

571
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:27,045
who reckons the machine's readings,
once you've used it a few times,

572
00:35:27,165 --> 00:35:28,765
they're not necessarily accurate.

573
00:35:28,885 --> 00:35:31,365
I need to meet this person
as soon as humanly possible.

574
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:38,245
I've had two papers published
in scientific journals on the subject.

575
00:35:38,365 --> 00:35:40,725
Governments choose
to ignore my findings, of course,

576
00:35:40,845 --> 00:35:43,805
breath-testing being
such a great source of revenue for them.

577
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:47,205
But the truth does not disappear
simply because it is inconvenient.

578
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:49,965
Just how inaccurate are these machines,
Elliott?

579
00:35:50,085 --> 00:35:55,165
It varies. Science demands exactitude,
but usually ends up with probabilities.

580
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:58,325
When you breathe out,
your breath goes directly into there.

581
00:35:58,445 --> 00:36:01,645
With each breath also goes
a microscopic amount of alcohol,

582
00:36:01,765 --> 00:36:03,125
or you wouldn't get the reading.

583
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:06,885
My contention is, the heavier
molecular weight of the alcohol

584
00:36:07,005 --> 00:36:08,365
remains in the breathalyser.

585
00:36:08,485 --> 00:36:11,445
If you breath-test, say,
200 people who have been drinking,

586
00:36:11,565 --> 00:36:16,085
the cumulative effect, if you're
number 201, can alter the reading

587
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:18,765
by an as yet unquantifiable
but not insignificant margin.

588
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,245
Doubt is all I need to establish.

589
00:36:21,365 --> 00:36:24,125
- You want a demonstration?
- Absolutely, we do.

590
00:36:32,325 --> 00:36:33,725
I've been thinking about this.

591
00:36:33,845 --> 00:36:38,925
I don't want to sing light opera.
I want to sing real opera.

592
00:36:39,045 --> 00:36:40,725
No. You don't.

593
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:45,565
You will be Valjean, the part that
almost won our Hugh an Oscar.

594
00:36:53,405 --> 00:36:58,685
So, already we're seeing a .0003
variation between the two machines.

595
00:37:00,605 --> 00:37:03,965
Extrapolate that over many people,
and you would have to say

596
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:08,165
the numbers conform
to a predictable hyperbolic rise.

597
00:37:08,285 --> 00:37:12,685
Well, let's tease out this hypothesis
a little more.

598
00:37:12,805 --> 00:37:14,485
Maybe the pinot next.

599
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:16,125
Pinot, pinot, pinot.

600
00:37:16,245 --> 00:37:18,285
Ah! Pinot.

601
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:24,565
If Humberstone is even a quarter
of a scintilla near right,

602
00:37:24,685 --> 00:37:26,925
we are made.

603
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,405
We saw the numbers.

604
00:37:28,525 --> 00:37:31,685
How many people have incurred fines
on faulty data?

605
00:37:31,805 --> 00:37:35,165
How many licences
have been needlessly lost?

606
00:37:35,285 --> 00:37:38,685
As many as there are
drops in the ocean.

607
00:37:38,805 --> 00:37:44,205
We are talking a massive class action
against government.

608
00:37:44,325 --> 00:37:47,045
More than the stars in the sky.

609
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:53,285
Are we absolutely convinced this guy's
scientific qualifications stack up?

610
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:54,925
A 100 per cent!

611
00:37:55,045 --> 00:37:56,965
Right.

612
00:37:57,085 --> 00:37:59,725
Then get it up on your website.

613
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:05,245
Tell everyone who has ever had a DUI
that there is a class action a-coming.

614
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:07,845
Put my name and number to it

615
00:38:07,965 --> 00:38:14,405
and stand back and behold
the glorious tidal wave to come.

616
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:20,565
OK, I have you on 9th July - a DUI.
What do we think, gentlemen, 15 minutes?

617
00:38:20,685 --> 00:38:25,645
I think more like two days, Your Honour.
This is a very complex case.

618
00:38:25,765 --> 00:38:27,125
No. How?

619
00:38:27,245 --> 00:38:31,165
Well, my client has a number of work-
and home-related factors

620
00:38:31,285 --> 00:38:34,765
that I believe have considerable bearing
on this case, Your Honour.

621
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:36,925
Fine. 20 minutes, then.

622
00:38:37,045 --> 00:38:40,165
And I have a welter
of scientific evidence

623
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:44,245
provided by an expert witness
that has grave implications

624
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:45,725
for the entire legal system.

625
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:48,845
OK! Back to 15.

626
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:52,045
Who is this man?

627
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:54,285
What is his story?

628
00:38:54,405 --> 00:38:58,085
On Monday 9th July,
a very special edition

629
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:01,845
of Aussies Gotta Sing,
where, for the very first time,

630
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:05,085
the surprise card will be played.

631
00:39:05,205 --> 00:39:11,365
This man will appear before our judges,
untried, unproven,

632
00:39:11,485 --> 00:39:14,245
and with a shocking secret.

633
00:39:14,365 --> 00:39:16,525
He will face final judgement.

634
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:21,525
Has Edie Newbar finally met her match?

635
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:27,325
So we bring him on.
You pretend you know nothing about him.

636
00:39:27,445 --> 00:39:30,645
Shock, horror, reveal. He's humiliated.

637
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:32,125
I know the drill.

638
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:36,565
But really push it to fight stage.
Then he rallies and sings.

639
00:39:36,685 --> 00:39:39,165
We line up lots of people
in the audience to whoop,

640
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:42,005
then you slowly rise to your feet
and clap.

641
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,845
Right, can the prick actually sing?

642
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,445
Oh, I think so. It's opera.

643
00:39:46,565 --> 00:39:49,165
The guy's a bona fide murderer.
This isn't just us.

644
00:39:49,285 --> 00:39:51,845
This is going to be news.
He's good for eight weeks.

645
00:39:51,965 --> 00:39:53,565
- Eight weeks?
- Minimum.

646
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:57,325
- We need Gordon in make-up now.
- That's good. I'm coming.

647
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:03,885
Your Honour, there are many grounds
on which I could defend my client today.

648
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:05,925
Glen Hansi - family man

649
00:40:06,045 --> 00:40:09,685
and production manager
at an aluminium-guttering company.

650
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:11,165
I could argue emotional stress.

651
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:14,525
His wife of eight years
recently left him for another woman,

652
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,805
which has seen him
in the hands of a psychologist

653
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:20,965
with whom he's already confronting
head-on the issue of substance abuse.

654
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:25,165
Yes. Indeed, there is considerable
precedent for such a submission.

655
00:40:25,285 --> 00:40:28,325
But I'm not going to argue that today,
Your Honour.

656
00:40:28,445 --> 00:40:31,845
I could argue that
his contact with his two young children

657
00:40:31,965 --> 00:40:34,645
will be severely curtailed
if he cannot drive

658
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:38,525
and that his career
in aluminium extrusions could be lost.

659
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:40,325
Crown and Bayliss, indeed.

660
00:40:40,445 --> 00:40:43,085
But I'm not going to argue
any of these here today.

661
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:44,725
Then why mention them?

662
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:48,445
Because, Your Honour,
there are bigger fish to fry here today.

663
00:40:48,565 --> 00:40:50,805
Which still begs my initial question -

664
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:53,005
why bother to mention
the other reasons at all?

665
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:55,805
I'm trying to establish a context,
Your Honour.

666
00:40:55,925 --> 00:41:02,325
What if I could prove here and now
that the entire foundation of this case

667
00:41:02,445 --> 00:41:05,925
and potentially thousands
of similar cases

668
00:41:06,045 --> 00:41:08,205
are open to serious question?

669
00:41:08,325 --> 00:41:11,645
What if I were to say
that there may be prisoners

670
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:14,005
languishing in prison today

671
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:18,965
who are entirely innocent
or at the very least worthy of acquittal

672
00:41:19,085 --> 00:41:22,885
on the basis of a fundamentally flawed
technology?

673
00:41:23,005 --> 00:41:26,805
I would say, get on with it, and quick.

674
00:41:26,925 --> 00:41:28,885
Indeed.

675
00:41:29,005 --> 00:41:34,485
And to that end, let me call Dr Elliott
Humberstone, PhD from Princeton,

676
00:41:34,605 --> 00:41:39,845
post-doctoral thesis from Harvard
and foundation member of the famed

677
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:43,405
Garrault Institute for Future Sciences.

678
00:41:43,525 --> 00:41:47,765
Fine,
but can you get him to jog to the stand?

679
00:41:56,085 --> 00:42:00,725
Dr Humberstone,
could you detail for the court's benefit

680
00:42:00,845 --> 00:42:03,965
the body of your work
for the past 35 years?

681
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:05,565
Oh, please don't.

682
00:42:05,685 --> 00:42:09,845
I'm prepared to accept
that he's a qualified scientist.

683
00:42:09,965 --> 00:42:13,325
Indeed. Dr Humberstone, some years ago,

684
00:42:13,445 --> 00:42:18,525
you began research into the technology
behind breath-testing.

685
00:42:18,645 --> 00:42:20,605
Yeah, I did do that, yes.

686
00:42:20,725 --> 00:42:24,285
Yes. Can you tell the court
what prompted this?

687
00:42:24,405 --> 00:42:29,805
An epiphany, one of those great moments
in science where I realised

688
00:42:29,925 --> 00:42:32,845
the basis upon which the taking
of alcohol samples from motorists

689
00:42:32,965 --> 00:42:38,005
was premised on a questionable
scientific hypo... hypothesis.

690
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:41,765
- Is something wrong there, Doctor?
- A mild head cold, Your Worship.

691
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:43,845
Honour.

692
00:42:43,965 --> 00:42:48,365
That the residual accretion
of alcoholic vapours

693
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:53,205
inside the very mechanism of the machine
contributed in no small part...

694
00:42:53,325 --> 00:42:56,005
Mr Greene,
is your so-called expert witness

695
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:58,685
three sheets to the wind in my court?

696
00:42:58,805 --> 00:43:00,325
No, I don't believe so.

697
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:02,565
Why is he wobbling in his chair, then?

698
00:43:02,685 --> 00:43:07,165
He has an inner-ear issue, Your Honour.

699
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:10,525
[, however,
have his findings right here.

700
00:43:10,645 --> 00:43:13,925
If it please the court,
I could possibly read them out.

701
00:43:14,045 --> 00:43:17,685
I will not tolerate drunks in my court,
Mr Greene.

702
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:20,005
I'm used to derision.
I've been mocked before.

703
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:24,645
- But I have the science to back up...
- Remove this man from my court.

704
00:43:24,765 --> 00:43:32,245
Mr Greene, I realise that this is
your first case since your release,

705
00:43:32,365 --> 00:43:35,565
but I've a good mind
to find you in contempt.

706
00:43:35,685 --> 00:43:38,285
Your Honour,
I have no idea what's happened.

707
00:43:38,405 --> 00:43:41,685
When I met him a couple of weeks ago,
he was like a scientist in a movie.

708
00:43:41,805 --> 00:43:44,405
Given that you have refused
to plead any alternatives,

709
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:46,645
I find your client guilty.

710
00:43:46,765 --> 00:43:52,925
I remove his licence for 12 months
and fine him $1,500.

711
00:43:53,045 --> 00:43:54,525
Next.

712
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:02,285
Don't even think about
sending a fucking bill.

713
00:44:04,565 --> 00:44:06,645
Ah, that's a shame.

714
00:44:06,765 --> 00:44:08,965
You'll be back in the harness soon.

715
00:44:09,085 --> 00:44:11,525
Saddle, you fuckwit.

716
00:44:16,085 --> 00:44:18,725
â™ª Lovely lady of the sea

717
00:44:18,845 --> 00:44:21,605
â™ª Won't you come and comfort me? â™ª

718
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:35,205
What the hell is going on, mate?

719
00:44:35,325 --> 00:44:39,885
I don't want to do that song.
I want to sing the aria from Tosca.

720
00:44:40,005 --> 00:44:42,325
I can do it unaccompanied.

721
00:44:42,445 --> 00:44:45,285
Let me tell you a little something, Mal.

722
00:44:45,405 --> 00:44:49,125
I don't really know if you can sing
or not. Opera all sounds the same to me.

723
00:44:49,245 --> 00:44:52,365
The only thing I do know is
either you can play things our way,

724
00:44:52,485 --> 00:44:55,205
or the road to obscurity lies that way.

725
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,765
You have just seconds to choose.

726
00:45:26,285 --> 00:45:27,645
Malcolm, is it?

727
00:45:27,765 --> 00:45:30,045
You're our...

728
00:45:30,165 --> 00:45:32,085
.surprise card, is that it?

729
00:45:33,685 --> 00:45:37,525
Tell us about yourself.
Why haven't we heard of you?

730
00:45:37,645 --> 00:45:40,125
You're not exactly young.

731
00:45:41,765 --> 00:45:44,165
What were you doing before now?

732
00:45:44,285 --> 00:45:47,325
Don't tell me - you were a mime artist.

733
00:45:53,685 --> 00:45:55,885
- I was in prison.
- What for?

734
00:45:59,525 --> 00:46:03,805
- I just want to sing.
- You were in for wanting to sing?

735
00:46:03,925 --> 00:46:08,365
It says here... murder.

736
00:46:10,365 --> 00:46:11,725
Your father.

737
00:46:11,845 --> 00:46:13,325
Is that right?

738
00:46:15,085 --> 00:46:17,645
Righto, Mal. Give it a go.

739
00:46:17,765 --> 00:46:19,645
Try not to murder the song.

740
00:46:33,605 --> 00:46:35,685
- Aw!
- What?!

741
00:46:35,805 --> 00:46:38,485
Did I say something wrong?

742
00:46:40,645 --> 00:46:42,725
Fantastic.

743
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:47,765
Now just give it 30 seconds.
Let the tension build to fever.

744
00:46:47,885 --> 00:46:49,805
Then walk back on as Valjean...

745
00:46:49,925 --> 00:46:52,485
You know what?!

746
00:46:52,605 --> 00:46:54,085
You know what?

747
00:46:59,005 --> 00:47:00,485
Fuck Valjean.

748
00:47:02,565 --> 00:47:04,045
Fuck you.

749
00:47:12,885 --> 00:47:14,925
You stole my mother's phone.

750
00:47:15,045 --> 00:47:16,405
No, I didn't.

751
00:47:16,525 --> 00:47:18,605
Then why are
a lot of pissed people ringing her,

752
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:20,165
demanding legal representation?

753
00:47:20,285 --> 00:47:24,045
OK, maybe I borrowed it by mistake
for a couple of days.

754
00:47:24,165 --> 00:47:27,085
You're buying her a new phone
and you are paying her last phone bill.

755
00:47:28,685 --> 00:47:30,165
Hello?

756
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:36,285
Yeah. No, mate. Look, I'm sorry.
I can't get your licence back.

757
00:47:36,405 --> 00:47:37,765
No, I...

758
00:47:37,885 --> 00:47:40,405
I know it said that on the website.

759
00:47:41,685 --> 00:47:44,885
OK, same to you. Same to you, pal.

760
00:47:45,005 --> 00:47:46,925
Oh, mate!

761
00:47:47,045 --> 00:47:49,565
Oh, it's so good to see you.

762
00:47:49,685 --> 00:47:51,045
Oh, I've missed you!

763
00:47:51,165 --> 00:47:54,605
How are you, and what's all this shit
about you going to the Congo?

764
00:47:54,725 --> 00:47:57,245
You know it's the most dangerous place
on earth.

765
00:47:57,365 --> 00:48:01,165
I know. I don't want to talk about that.
I came to apologise.

766
00:48:01,285 --> 00:48:04,725
I want to say,
I'm sorry for kind of cutting you off,

767
00:48:04,845 --> 00:48:06,925
not visiting so much
the past few months.

768
00:48:07,045 --> 00:48:10,565
Oh, that's OK.
It must have been a bit embarrassing.

769
00:48:10,685 --> 00:48:13,685
No, that's not why I stopped coming.

770
00:48:13,805 --> 00:48:18,685
I started to get really angry with you,
and I had no right to do that.

771
00:48:18,805 --> 00:48:21,165
Yes, you did.
I was completely furious with myself.

772
00:48:21,285 --> 00:48:25,125
You are who you are.
You can't change that.

773
00:48:25,245 --> 00:48:29,245
No, I can change,
and I'm going to change.

774
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:34,485
No. People kept telling me you couldn't,
and I wouldn't believe them.

775
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:38,485
You're just someone
people can't rely on, and that's OK.

776
00:48:38,605 --> 00:48:41,365
I just...
I had no right to expect any better.

777
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:44,125
Fuzz, if this is about
dropping out of school...

778
00:48:44,245 --> 00:48:46,605
No, I don't want to study.

779
00:48:46,725 --> 00:48:49,685
I want to be someone
who can help people.

780
00:48:49,805 --> 00:48:51,925
I want to be someone people can rely on.

781
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:55,365
Mate, for someone who's forgiven me,
you sound pretty angry.

782
00:48:55,485 --> 00:48:56,845
I promise you, I'm not.

783
00:48:56,965 --> 00:49:00,485
I just don't want to have
any expectations of you anymore.

784
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,965
It's too hard.

785
00:49:03,085 --> 00:49:05,725
I'm fine with it.

786
00:49:05,845 --> 00:49:08,885
Well... no.

787
00:49:09,005 --> 00:49:12,765
I'm your father.
We have a special relationship.

788
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:15,605
OK.

789
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:21,525
I'll call you in a few days, Cleave,
catch up before I leave.

790
00:49:21,645 --> 00:49:25,245
'Dad'. Come on, at least call me 'Dad'.

791
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:29,165
Fuck.

792
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:34,725
There's a call for you.

793
00:49:34,845 --> 00:49:38,205
Can you just tell them
I can't fix any fucking thing?

794
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:39,925
It's your friend, Mal.

795
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:43,005
Oh, the turtle show! Oh, shit.
Oh, my God.

796
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,485
Mate!

797
00:49:44,605 --> 00:49:50,285
Oh, mate, I'm so sorry. The taxi didn't
arrive, and I couldn't...

798
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:52,285
How did it go?

799
00:49:52,405 --> 00:49:54,405
Oh, I'm sorry.

800
00:49:55,645 --> 00:49:57,125
No, don't be stu...

801
00:49:58,325 --> 00:50:01,005
Don't be crazy, mate. Where are you?

802
00:50:03,205 --> 00:50:05,045
What are you doing?

803
00:50:05,165 --> 00:50:06,685
- What are you doing, Malcolm?
- No!

804
00:50:06,805 --> 00:50:10,405
- Get down.
- Stop! You stay back. You stay back.

805
00:50:14,085 --> 00:50:16,405
- It's over, Cleave.
- Oh, mate.

806
00:50:16,525 --> 00:50:19,925
No, it's all finished now.

807
00:50:20,045 --> 00:50:23,485
Oh, mate, come on.
Look, you've got another 50 years.

808
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:26,565
Is this all about some fucking...
stupid talent quest?

809
00:50:26,685 --> 00:50:28,165
No.

810
00:50:29,685 --> 00:50:31,605
No.

811
00:50:31,725 --> 00:50:33,085
That was it, mate.

812
00:50:33,205 --> 00:50:35,885
The world will always be full of people
who want to judge you.

813
00:50:36,005 --> 00:50:38,845
You can't let them.
Don't give them that power.

814
00:50:38,965 --> 00:50:43,445
Don't give them that power! OK?

815
00:50:43,565 --> 00:50:47,245
Look, things aren't turning out all that
well for me either at the moment,

816
00:50:47,365 --> 00:50:51,165
but you have to believe
that things can change, alright?

817
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:52,845
They change. They do.

818
00:50:52,965 --> 00:50:57,325
No, some lives don't change,
do they, Cleave?

819
00:50:59,845 --> 00:51:01,325
Some lives...

820
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,485
..never really get started.

821
00:51:06,165 --> 00:51:09,485
They're just fucked...
fucked up from the beginning.

822
00:51:10,805 --> 00:51:12,445
It just goes on and on.

823
00:51:19,325 --> 00:51:21,765
I never sang for you, did I, mate?

824
00:51:23,845 --> 00:51:25,205
I wish I had.

825
00:51:25,325 --> 00:51:28,125
Well, come on, mate - fucking sing now!

826
00:51:28,245 --> 00:51:30,365
Sing your...
sing your little heart out.

827
00:51:30,485 --> 00:51:34,365
Come on. And then will you get down
off the railing?

828
00:51:39,245 --> 00:51:43,125
â™ª O, dolci baci

829
00:51:43,245 --> 00:51:48,205
â™ª O, languide carezze

830
00:51:48,325 --> 00:51:52,365
â™ª Mentr'io fremente

831
00:51:52,485 --> 00:52:05,245
â™ª Le belle forme disciogliea dai veli. â™ª

832
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,405
Mate.

833
00:52:13,525 --> 00:52:16,485
Mate, that's fucking amazing!

834
00:52:18,005 --> 00:52:20,325
That is fucking amazing.

835
00:52:20,445 --> 00:52:22,685
Come on, keep singing, mate.

836
00:52:22,805 --> 00:52:24,325
Keep singing!

837
00:52:24,445 --> 00:52:27,365
Keep singing. It's fucking beautiful.
Come on, mate.

838
00:52:27,485 --> 00:52:30,165
I told you I could do it.

839
00:52:38,685 --> 00:52:40,925
Fuck.

840
00:52:41,045 --> 00:52:42,925
Oh, fuck.

841
00:52:43,045 --> 00:52:45,445
