1
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:46,640
Frank, the problem is all new Prime Ministers
want to cut either taxes or public expenditure.

2
00:00:46,806 --> 00:00:49,274
Thank you. That's what Hacker wants, too.

3
00:00:49,446 --> 00:00:51,516
Politicians are like children.

4
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:55,395
You can't just give them what they want.
It only encourages them!

5
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:58,319
But let's be clear about this, Humphrey.

6
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:03,317
The entire system hinges on you
as Cabinet Secretary controlling the PM

7
00:01:03,486 --> 00:01:07,718
and on me as Permanent Secretary
at the Treasury controlling the Chancellor.

8
00:01:07,886 --> 00:01:09,444
- Right?
- Right.

9
00:01:09,606 --> 00:01:14,316
And on both of us keeping an agreeable tension
between them, mistrust, hostility.

10
00:01:14,526 --> 00:01:18,314
Mind you, I think they'd manage that all right
even without us.

11
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:23,480
The Chancellor will never forgive the Prime
Minister for beating him to Number 10

12
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:26,797
and the Prime Minister
will never trust the Chancellor.

13
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:30,595
- One never trusts anyone one has deceived.
- Perhaps not.

14
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:33,838
But tax cuts unite them. They get them both votes.

15
00:01:34,046 --> 00:01:38,836
Yes, but surely this tax cut is contingent
upon the Prime Minister's fantasy

16
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:42,396
about cancelling Trident
and switching to conventional forces.

17
00:01:42,606 --> 00:01:47,236
Nevertheless, he is giving away
£1.5 billion of our money!

18
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:52,844
It's unthinkable, even if only proposals. I had
a real job getting the Chancellor to oppose it.

19
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,037
How did you do it?

20
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:59,836
I used the one about our needing the money
for hospitals, schools and old people.

21
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:02,998
- The kidney machine gambit.
- The caring Chancellor (!)

22
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,674
- Yes, that one.
- It usually works.

23
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:10,362
But would a tax cut matter all that much?
It's only £1.5 billion.

24
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:15,441
I agree, it's not much in itself. My worry
is about you letting it get through so soon.

25
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:19,520
If I were in your shoes at the Treasury,

26
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:24,441
I'd be much more worried about the state
of the economy, low productivity.

27
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,482
That's not our fault.

28
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:31,878
It's the British worker - fundamentally lazy,
wants something for nothing.

29
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:37,040
The figures for absenteeism are going up and up.
Nobody wants to do an honest day's work.

30
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:39,879
- Shocking! I must rush.
- Busy afternoon?

31
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:42,725
Yes, indeed. I gather England are 70 for 3.

32
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:49,796
(APPLAUSE)

33
00:02:51,206 --> 00:02:53,595
Whoa, whoa! Easy does it, Gerald.

34
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:58,038
Plenty more where that came from.
Cheers. To the Civil Service!

35
00:02:58,926 --> 00:03:01,565
To the British Tobacco Group and its chairman.

36
00:03:01,726 --> 00:03:03,717
Thank you.

37
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:06,205
Ah!

38
00:03:06,366 --> 00:03:08,880
I do love a good afternoon's cricket.

39
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:14,599
You know, you chaps at BTG
are national benefactors really.

40
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:16,757
We like to think so.

41
00:03:16,926 --> 00:03:22,398
You know, Gerald, I've got a small favour
to ask on behalf of the Royal 0pera House.

42
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:27,082
Now, as you know, Covent Garden
is more or less run from the Cabinet Office.

43
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:33,598
But I'm told that one or more productions
are threatened next year, lack of funds.

44
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:37,640
Well, I've got the Minister for Sport
coming along this afternoon.

45
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:42,800
I know he wants to twist my arm on behalf
of Wimbledon or Brands Hatch or something.

46
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:45,560
Covent Garden... We'll see what we can do.

47
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,718
Oh, I don't know where we'd all be without you.

48
00:03:49,326 --> 00:03:51,840
Tell me, have you ever invited Peter Thorne?

49
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:55,203
- The Minister of Health?
- You always included them.

50
00:03:55,406 --> 00:03:58,603
This one's been got at by the anti-smoking lobby.

51
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,876
Oh, silly man!

52
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:04,874
Very silly. He hasn't got
much clout in Whitehall, has he?

53
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:07,316
None at all. He's just a minister.

54
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:10,557
Good shot!

55
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:14,237
Was he out?

56
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:19,563
Humphrey, this paper says that
if we cancel Trident and bring in conscription,

57
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,036
we shall have £1.5 billion for tax cuts,
and what do I find?

58
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:27,239
- What do you find, Prime Minister?
- The Chancellor opposes me.

59
00:04:27,406 --> 00:04:32,196
A great chance to be popular with the voters
and he says no. Doesn't that surprise you?

60
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,998
No.

61
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:36,636
Why doesn't it surprise you?

62
00:04:36,846 --> 00:04:40,964
He's advised by the Treasury
and they don't believe in giving money back.

63
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:45,597
- It's not theirs. It's the taxpayers'.
- That's not the view the Treasury takes.

64
00:04:46,206 --> 00:04:49,562
- Not once they've got it.
- But if they don't need it?

65
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:52,604
- Sorry?
- If they don't need it.

66
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:56,554
- Taxation isn't about what you need.
- What is it about?

67
00:04:56,726 --> 00:05:02,801
The Treasury doesn't work out what they need
to spend and then think how to raise the money.

68
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:04,997
What D0ES it do?

69
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:10,160
They pitch for as much as they think they can
get away with, then think what to spend it on.

70
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:14,076
If you start giving money back
because you don't need it,

71
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:17,079
you're breaking with centuries of tradition.

72
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:21,239
- What would happen to the British Navy?
- We still need a navy.

73
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:26,440
We have four capital ships, so we need only
four admirals and one Admiral of the Fleet.

74
00:05:26,646 --> 00:05:29,444
- How many Admirals have we got?
- 60.

75
00:05:30,526 --> 00:05:34,314
The Treasury's the most powerful department
as it controls all the money.

76
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:38,240
If you take away its money,
you take away its power, so they resist.

77
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:42,644
- How will the Treasury agree to tax cuts?
- Get the Chancellor to agree.

78
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:45,918
- How will the Chancellor agree?
- Get the Treasury to agree.

79
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:49,755
- This is impossible.
- Yes, Prime Minister, it is impossible.

80
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:54,721
- We must be able to force the Treasury's hand.
- Yes, by forcing the Chancellor's hand.

81
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:58,760
- How do I force the Chancellor's hand?
- By forcing the Treasury's hand.

82
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:02,242
Can't Y0U persuade the Chancellor?
He's your Cabinet colleague.

83
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:06,075
That's the point.
I need help from somebody who's on my side.

84
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:09,674
The Minister of State at the DHSS is here.

85
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:13,475
- Show him in. Thank you, Humphrey.
- Thank you, Prime Minister.

86
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:16,638
- Dr Thorne, Prime Minister.
- Peter, come in.

87
00:06:17,686 --> 00:06:19,677
Sit down.

88
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:22,758
Now, you wanted to talk to me about...?

89
00:06:23,686 --> 00:06:26,280
- Cigarettes.
- Ah, yes.

90
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:29,404
- You read my paper?
- Yes, absolutely.

91
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:31,761
How did you react?

92
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:35,635
Well, I...wonder if you could summarise it
in your own words.

93
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:40,765
Those WERE my own words.

94
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:44,119
Yes, yes, exactly, of course.

95
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:49,878
But the Prime Minister often finds that a brief
summary focuses on the salient points.

96
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:52,435
Salient points, precisely.

97
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:58,480
Well, briefly, I'm proposing that the government
should take action to eliminate smoking,

98
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:02,400
a complete ban
on all cigarette sponsorship and advertising,

99
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:05,962
£50 million to be spent on anti-smoking publicity,

100
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:11,246
a ban on smoking in all public places and
progressive tax rises over the next five years

101
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:15,194
until a packet of 20 costs about the same
as a bottle of whisky.

102
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:19,521
Isn't that rather drastic?

103
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:24,641
Absolutely. It should reduce smoking
by at least 80%, 90% if we're lucky

104
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:27,366
and drive tobacco companies out of business.

105
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:32,643
Yes. Well, Peter, of course,
you know I agree with you basically.

106
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:35,161
Smoking should be stopped.

107
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:38,398
No question. And we will stop it in due course.

108
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:42,756
At the appropriate juncture,
in the fullness of time.

109
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:46,838
- You mean forget it?
- No, absolutely not.

110
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:51,276
But we must be realists.
You and I weren't born yesterday.

111
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:55,115
- No, and we didn't die yesterday.
- No. What?

112
00:07:56,206 --> 00:08:00,802
300 people did prematurely
as a result of smoking.

113
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:03,844
100,000 deaths a year at least.

114
00:08:04,046 --> 00:08:08,039
It's appalling,
but you know what the Treasury would say?

115
00:08:08,246 --> 00:08:12,558
They'd say that smoking brings in
£4 billion a year in revenue.

116
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:16,520
- You can't beat the Treasury.
- Not with financial arguments.

117
00:08:16,686 --> 00:08:19,154
But this is a moral argument.

118
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:21,317
Yes, but even...

119
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:27,764
Wait a minute. I've got an idea.
This could be a way to beat the Treasury.

120
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,322
- You mean you'll support me?
- You've made your point.

121
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:35,001
We'll give it a try.
I'll even read your report. Again!

122
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:40,755
This could be very interesting.
Thank you very much indeed.

123
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:43,355
But will you support me?

124
00:08:43,526 --> 00:08:45,801
Yeah, well, not publicly.

125
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:50,960
It would undermine my position, undermine
the argument if I supported you from the start.

126
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:56,317
I have to be seen as the impartial judge
swayed by the force of the argument.

127
00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:58,517
Yes, I see that.

128
00:08:58,686 --> 00:09:02,474
But off the record,
I'd like to see this pushed very hard indeed.

129
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:06,525
Make some speeches on it.
Peter, thank you very much indeed.

130
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:13,477
Thank you for your cigarette paper...
your paper on cigarettes.

131
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:18,874
- Is this serious?
- What do you mean?

132
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:21,156
It's always been the practice

133
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:25,638
to discourage anti-smoking speeches
by ministers and not to distribute them.

134
00:09:25,846 --> 00:09:29,759
Well, I want Peter's speeches distributed.
I want everybody to know.

135
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:35,199
Yes, Prime Minister. Do you think you will win
this one? The tobacco lobby is very powerful.

136
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:40,639
Well, some you win, some you lose, Bernard.
This one I shall definitely lose.

137
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,359
Then why?

138
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:46,519
If you were the Treasury, would you rather do
without £1.5 billion in tax cuts

139
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,041
or £4 billion in lost tobacco tax revenue?

140
00:09:49,206 --> 00:09:51,515
- The tax cuts.
- (PHOnE RINGS)

141
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:55,196
Exactly. That's what I want
and that's what I shall get.

142
00:09:55,406 --> 00:09:58,000
- Can Sir Humphrey have a word?
- 0f course.

143
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,236
Yes, come in, please.

144
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:05,635
- Prime Minister...
- Humphrey.

145
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:09,116
Did you have an interesting chat with Dr Thorne?

146
00:10:09,326 --> 00:10:12,045
Yes. He proposed the elimination of smoking.

147
00:10:15,886 --> 00:10:18,684
By a campaign of mass hypnosis perhaps!

148
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:24,766
By raising tobacco taxes sky high
and simultaneously banning all advertising.

149
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:32,002
- I think his position is admirably moral.
- Moral perhaps, but extremely silly.

150
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:36,125
No man in his right mind
could contemplate such a proposal.

151
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:38,521
I'm contemplating it.

152
00:10:38,686 --> 00:10:42,964
Yes, of course, Prime Minister.
Please don't misunderstand me.

153
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:48,120
It is quite right that you should COnTEMPLATE
all proposals that come from your government,

154
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:50,754
but no sane man would ever SUPP0RT it.

155
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:54,481
- I'm supporting it.
- And quite right too, Prime Minister.

156
00:10:54,646 --> 00:11:00,118
The only problem is that the tax on tobacco is
a major source of revenue for the government.

157
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,760
And a major source of death from diseases.

158
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:07,084
Yes, but no definite causative link
has ever been proved, has it?

159
00:11:07,286 --> 00:11:10,198
- The statistics...
- You can prove anything with statistics.

160
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:13,045
- Even the truth.
- Yes... No!

161
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:19,924
It says here, ''Smoking-related diseases
cost the NHS £165 million a year.''

162
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:22,515
Yes, but we've been into that.

163
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:27,476
It has been shown that if those extra
100,000 people had lived to a ripe old age,

164
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:31,878
they would have cost us even more
in pensions and social security

165
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:34,514
than they did in medical treatment.

166
00:11:34,686 --> 00:11:37,962
So financially speaking, it's unquestionably better

167
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:41,323
that they continue to die at about the present rate.

168
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:46,884
''When cholera killed 30,000 people in 1833,
we got the Public Health Act.

169
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:51,039
''When smog killed 2,500 people in 1952,
we got the Clean Air Act.''

170
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:55,802
A commercial drug kills half a dozen people
and we get it withdrawn from sale.

171
00:11:56,406 --> 00:12:00,319
Cigarettes kill 100,000 people a year
and what do we get?

172
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:03,165
£4 billion a year.

173
00:12:03,366 --> 00:12:07,837
25,000 jobs in the tobacco industry,
a flourishing cigarette export business,

174
00:12:08,006 --> 00:12:10,361
helping our balance of trade,

175
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:14,439
250,000 jobs related to tobacco -
newsagents, packaging, transport...

176
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:19,117
- These figures are just guesses.
- No, they're government st... They're facts.

177
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:25,280
So your statistics are facts
and my facts are merely statistics?

178
00:12:25,486 --> 00:12:29,684
I'm on your side. I'm merely giving you
some arguments you'll encounter.

179
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:33,765
Humphrey, I'm so glad to know
we'll have support such as yours.

180
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:38,397
It will be pointed out that the tobacco
companies are great sponsors of sport.

181
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:43,162
Where would the BBC sports programmes be
if cigarette companies couldn't advert...

182
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:46,438
couldn't SPOnS0R the events that they televise?

183
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:49,994
We're talking about 100,000 deaths a year.

184
00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:54,802
Yes, but cigarette taxes pay for a third
of the cost of the National Health Service.

185
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:58,163
We're saving many more lives
than we otherwise could

186
00:12:58,326 --> 00:13:02,842
because of those smokers who voluntarily
lay down their lives for their friends.

187
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:06,554
Smokers are national benefactors.

188
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,677
So long as they live!

189
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:12,997
Not that any definite causal link
has ever been proved.

190
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:18,963
It's time for your next Cabinet committee,
then the Minister of Sport wants an urgent word.

191
00:13:19,126 --> 00:13:21,594
- What about?
- Sponsorship.

192
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:26,355
Who tipped him off?
He's one of the tobacco lobby.

193
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:29,239
A member of YOur government?

194
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:34,321
Yes, he's Minister for Sport. He has a vested
interest. He's also an MP for Nottingham.

195
00:13:34,486 --> 00:13:36,954
Did you tell him? How did he know?

196
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:39,640
The grapevine perhaps. Prime Minister...

197
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:43,200
Tell the minister I'll see him at 2.30.

198
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:47,837
- With pleasure, Prime Minister.
- Not with pleasure, but I'll see him anyway.

199
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:51,834
The Minister for Sport, Prime Minister.

200
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:54,600
Oh, Leslie, my dear fellow. Hi.

201
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,554
Do you mind if I smoke?

202
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:03,800
Prime Minister, it's about the rumour

203
00:14:03,966 --> 00:14:08,039
that you intend to make a personal attack
on the tobacco industry.

204
00:14:08,206 --> 00:14:10,800
- I hadn't heard that rumour.
- It's not true?

205
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:14,003
The Minister for Health is considering the matter.

206
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,555
There's no smoke without fire.

207
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:20,799
You'd be consulted.
As Minister for Sport, you have an interest.

208
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:22,997
Never mind sport.

209
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:29,082
There are marginal seats in Bristol, Nottingham,
Glasgow, Basildon and Northern Ireland,

210
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:31,441
all with tobacco workers.

211
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:35,884
I've got 4,000 tobacco workers
in my constituency. What about my seat?

212
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:38,480
(C0UGHS WHEEZILY)

213
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,202
What about your lungs?

214
00:14:41,726 --> 00:14:43,717
My lungs are fine.

215
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,679
He doesn't breathe through his seat.

216
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,800
Oh, your seat, I see, I'm sorry.

217
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:55,596
Thank you, Bernard. I see the difficulty,
but if something is right for the country,

218
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:58,234
surely the government must pursue it.

219
00:14:58,406 --> 00:15:03,196
The government must do what's right,
but not if it affects marginal constituencies.

220
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:06,119
- There is a limit.
- No decision has been taken.

221
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:08,999
For the good of the party, you can't do this.

222
00:15:09,206 --> 00:15:13,199
Weren't you a paid consultant
to the British Tobacco Group?

223
00:15:13,966 --> 00:15:18,596
0f course, the fact that the BTG
did pay me a small retainer,

224
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:21,155
it's totally beside the point.

225
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:26,844
They're a very generous corporation with a strong
sense of responsibility to the community.

226
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:29,600
Look at all the money they give to sport!

227
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:32,274
They just do it to sell more cigarettes.

228
00:15:32,446 --> 00:15:35,279
No, they do it as a service to the community.

229
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:41,118
Oh, that's all right, then. They can go on
giving the money anonymously if they like.

230
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:43,794
Well, I'm sure they'd be happy to,

231
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:48,437
provided they could publicise the fact
that they were doing it anonymously.

232
00:15:48,606 --> 00:15:53,521
Is it true that Peter Thorne is also trying
to change the government health warning?

233
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:55,205
Is it?

234
00:15:55,366 --> 00:16:00,838
He's proposing something like ''Dying of
lung cancer can seriously damage your health''.

235
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:03,037
It is not true!

236
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:05,674
If we do nothing, in the next ten years,

237
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:08,997
in this country
we'll have one million premature deaths.

238
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:11,674
Yes, but evenly spread.

239
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:15,560
Not just in marginal constituencies.

240
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:21,121
Listen, Jim, there is no conclusive proof
of any causal link

241
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:23,436
between smoking and...

242
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:25,961
(C0UGHS)

243
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:30,915
We at the DHSS
are profoundly worried about smoking.

244
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:35,597
And we agree it's our duty to help
the Prime Minister achieve his objective,

245
00:16:35,766 --> 00:16:40,157
but with a third of the voters as smokers,
I can't raise taxes too high.

246
00:16:40,326 --> 00:16:46,003
The Chancellor won't commit electoral suicide
and the inflationary effect is considerable.

247
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,640
There is a moral principle involved.

248
00:16:48,846 --> 00:16:50,962
Moral principle, yes.

249
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:56,843
We understand the PM's concern. In fact,
we earnestly believe in the moral principle.

250
00:16:57,046 --> 00:17:01,119
But where £4 billion of revenue is at stake,

251
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,278
I think we should have
to consider very carefully

252
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:06,960
whether we have the right to indulge ourselves

253
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:11,278
in the rather selfish luxury
of pursuing moral principles.

254
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:16,560
Where would the arts be without tobacco
sponsorship? At the mercy of the Arts Council.

255
00:17:16,726 --> 00:17:22,483
Exactly. Then those silly pressure groups
and fanatics like the Royal College of Physicians!

256
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:24,085
Fanatics!

257
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:27,238
They want the government
to have a policy on the matter.

258
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,438
It would be different
if the government were a team,

259
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:34,076
but in fact they're a loose confederation
of warring tribes.

260
00:17:35,326 --> 00:17:41,276
If only the PM could meet the tobacco people,
he could see what really nice chaps they were.

261
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:44,603
And genuinely concerned about the health risks.

262
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:50,563
There can't be anything wrong with them. BTG
have an ex-Permanent Secretary on their board.

263
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:54,759
- And could well have more.
- In the fullness of time.

264
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:59,998
I think we ought to raise some questions
about your minister, Ian.

265
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:04,045
What does he know about the subject?
Peter Thorne is only a doctor.

266
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:06,720
His sole purpose is keeping people alive!

267
00:18:06,926 --> 00:18:08,917
Must be biased.

268
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:13,557
Seeing your patients die
must emotionally distort your judgement.

269
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:18,481
It's very understandable,
but a great handicap to cool decision-taking.

270
00:18:18,686 --> 00:18:21,962
Very true,
but can we find something a bit stronger?

271
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:26,557
Frank, I think the crucial argument
is that we're living in a free country.

272
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:29,240
We must be free to make our own decisions.

273
00:18:29,406 --> 00:18:33,399
Government shouldn't be a nursemaid.
We don't want the nanny state.

274
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:34,919
- Very good.
- Excellent.

275
00:18:35,086 --> 00:18:38,237
The only problem is that is also the argument

276
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:42,160
for legalising the sale
of marijuana, heroin, arsenic and gelignite.

277
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:45,995
Maybe that's a good idea
if we put a big enough tax on them.

278
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:49,118
- Politically difficult.
- Pity.

279
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:50,805
Yes.

280
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:53,559
Got it!

281
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:59,043
When the Prime Minister was
Minister for Administrative Affairs,

282
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:04,644
I used to get him to accompany me on regular
visits to Lord's, Wimbledon and Glyndebourne

283
00:19:04,846 --> 00:19:07,041
as a guest of BTG,

284
00:19:07,206 --> 00:19:12,485
so he's thoroughly implicated
in receiving hospitality worth hundreds,

285
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:15,035
possibly thousands from them.

286
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:20,121
Now, if that were to leak...
shocking though a leak would be...

287
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:23,198
- Oh, shocking.
- Shocking.

288
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:27,521
It'd be profoundly embarrassing
for the Prime Minister.

289
00:19:27,686 --> 00:19:30,519
I can't think why I didn't think of it before.

290
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:32,677
Nor can I.

291
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:39,194
- Well, Bernard.
- Well, Prime Minister.

292
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:41,966
Very well. Things are going very well indeed.

293
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:44,157
Oh, good.

294
00:19:44,326 --> 00:19:47,318
I've got the Treasury on the run and the Chancellor.

295
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,954
Is that good? He's in your own government.

296
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:55,154
0f course it's good. They've got to learn
to come to heel and learn to co-operate.

297
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:59,405
- What do you mean, co-operate?
- I mean obey my commands!

298
00:19:59,606 --> 00:20:01,085
I see.

299
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:04,801
That's what ''co-operate'' means
when you're Prime Minister.

300
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:09,596
Why are these tax cuts in your interest?
It's your government too.

301
00:20:09,806 --> 00:20:14,596
Bernard, it's simple. Cutting taxes by
£1.5 billion is going to win us masses of votes.

302
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:19,635
My ministers are interested in getting money
for their departments, not in supporting me.

303
00:20:19,806 --> 00:20:23,594
I'm using my support for Peter Thorne
as leverage on the Treasury.

304
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,525
- Your loyal support?
- Precisely.

305
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:29,120
In order to get THEIR loyal support.

306
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:33,564
After you get the tax cut, you will withdraw
your support from Peter Thorne?

307
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,997
- Bernard, how can you be so cynical?
- (PHOnE RINGS)

308
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,839
I shall simply rearrange my priorities.

309
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:42,600
Sir Humphrey's waiting to see you outside.

310
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:44,916
Send him in at once.

311
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:49,079
Yes, Prime Minister. Your word is my co-operation.

312
00:20:54,326 --> 00:20:56,317
- Humphrey!
- Prime Minister.

313
00:20:56,486 --> 00:21:00,445
- Everything all right?
- Everything is very far from all right.

314
00:21:00,646 --> 00:21:04,161
- What's the trouble?
- Your anti-smoking legislation.

315
00:21:04,326 --> 00:21:05,759
What about it?

316
00:21:05,926 --> 00:21:08,963
Notwithstanding the fact that your proposal

317
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:12,801
could encompass certain concomitant benefits
of a peripheral relevance,

318
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:16,959
there is a countervailing consideration
of infinitely superior magnitude,

319
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:21,005
involving your personal complicity
and corroborative malfeasance,

320
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:26,160
with the consequence that the taint and stigma
of your former associations and diversions

321
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:30,080
could irredeemably
and irretrievably invalidate your position

322
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:35,036
and culminate in public revelations
and recriminations of a profoundly embarrassing

323
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:37,720
and ultimately indefensible character.

324
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:41,674
Perhaps I could have a précis of that.

325
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:47,715
- There's nicotine on your hands.
- What do you mean?

326
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:51,805
All the hospitality
that we've enjoyed at BTG's expense.

327
00:21:51,966 --> 00:21:55,720
Champagne receptions,
the best seats at sporting and cultural events.

328
00:21:55,926 --> 00:22:00,158
- What's the problem?
- The tobacco companies may tell the press.

329
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:05,360
So? I've had drinks at the Soviet embassy.
That doesn't make me a Russian spy.

330
00:22:06,486 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh... Well... Oh.

331
00:22:10,486 --> 00:22:12,795
- Does it?
- Well, no.

332
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:15,480
Let them do their worst. Anything else?

333
00:22:15,646 --> 00:22:20,003
Well, Prime Minister,
there is another vital point to bear in mind.

334
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,680
A lot of eminent people, influential people

335
00:22:22,846 --> 00:22:26,725
argue that such legislation
would be a blow against freedom of choice.

336
00:22:26,926 --> 00:22:32,125
Rubbish! I'm not banning smoking. Does every
tax rise represent a blow against freedom?

337
00:22:32,326 --> 00:22:34,794
Well, it depends how big the tax rise is.

338
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:38,638
Fascinating! Does 20 pence
represent a blow against freedom?

339
00:22:38,846 --> 00:22:42,839
- Prime Minister...
- 25 pence? 30 pence? 31?

340
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:48,080
Is something a blow against freedom simply
because it can seriously damage your wealth?

341
00:22:48,286 --> 00:22:53,406
I must warn you of the difficulties.
I foresee all sorts of unforeseen problems.

342
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:55,198
Such as?

343
00:22:55,366 --> 00:22:58,563
If I could foresee them,
they wouldn't be unforeseen.

344
00:23:00,726 --> 00:23:03,445
You just said you C0ULD foresee them.

345
00:23:03,606 --> 00:23:06,598
If we could set up
an inter-departmental committee,

346
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:10,202
a Royal Commission,
perhaps a Treasury Committee...

347
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:13,398
- Don't talk to me about the Treasury!
- Why not?

348
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:17,559
The Treasury are blocking my plans
for a £1.5 billion tax cut.

349
00:23:18,326 --> 00:23:21,682
If only they could be more...flexible.

350
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:26,565
Oh...

351
00:23:28,086 --> 00:23:32,637
Well, I don't think they're fully committed
on that other matter yet.

352
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,359
Really?

353
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:39,075
Absolutely not.
Oh, no, I'm sure they could find a way.

354
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:41,277
Could they?

355
00:23:41,446 --> 00:23:45,962
The only stumbling block would be
if your anti-smoking proposals went through,

356
00:23:46,126 --> 00:23:50,278
they'd be too busy with those
to find a way to help with the other cuts.

357
00:23:50,486 --> 00:23:54,559
Well, of course, my anti-smoking proposals,
important though they are,

358
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:58,275
don't have nearly such a high priority as defence.

359
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:00,479
Ah.

360
00:24:01,286 --> 00:24:03,754
The Minister of State for Health is here.

361
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:08,920
Prime Minister, if I might have one or two
minutes to make some phone calls. Thank you.

362
00:24:09,086 --> 00:24:11,156
Show him in, Bernard.

363
00:24:12,446 --> 00:24:15,643
- Dr Thorne.
- Peter, what can I do for you?

364
00:24:15,806 --> 00:24:18,274
I've just had some very exciting news.

365
00:24:18,446 --> 00:24:23,122
We've got full backing from the BMA
and eight top scientific and medical colleges.

366
00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:26,557
Marvellous.

367
00:24:27,286 --> 00:24:30,278
But your legislation
can't be put through immediately.

368
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:36,038
It is announced as government policy within
three months, with a White Paper in a year.

369
00:24:36,246 --> 00:24:41,878
Yes, since we spoke, I've encountered
a few problems. The Treasury, you know.

370
00:24:42,086 --> 00:24:46,284
- Can't be anything you didn't know already?
- Yes. I mean no... Well, yes.

371
00:24:46,446 --> 00:24:48,960
Peter, it's not as simple as you think.

372
00:24:49,126 --> 00:24:51,594
Jim, I really am serious about this.

373
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:56,282
It's the one really important and worthwhile
thing I believe I can do in politics.

374
00:24:56,446 --> 00:25:00,803
If you stall it, I'll have to resign. And say why.

375
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:05,796
Excuse me, Prime Minister. Could Sir Humphrey
see you urgently just for a moment?

376
00:25:05,966 --> 00:25:08,958
- Would you mind waiting outside, Peter?
- 0f course.

377
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:14,601
Prime Minister, it's quite all right.

378
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:19,920
The Treasury have looked at your proposal again
and they can encompass your tax cut,

379
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:23,396
provided no work is needed
on the anti-smoking proposal.

380
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:26,120
That's fine, but there is another complication.

381
00:25:26,286 --> 00:25:28,754
Peter Thorne is going to resign if I drop it,

382
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:33,442
go to the press and have me condemned
by all the doctors and scientists in Britain.

383
00:25:33,606 --> 00:25:35,085
Oh...

384
00:25:35,246 --> 00:25:36,725
Help!

385
00:25:39,326 --> 00:25:42,636
You still have that government vacancy
in the Treasury?

386
00:25:43,366 --> 00:25:47,678
You mean...? It's a very big promotion,
a very rapid one.

387
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:50,605
Nevertheless, for a very able minister.

388
00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:56,277
Bernard, get Peter back in here and then get on
to the Department of the Environment.

389
00:25:56,446 --> 00:25:58,880
Get Leslie Potts over here at once.

390
00:25:59,046 --> 00:26:02,834
Prime Minister, I think I'll just, erm...
If you'll excuse me.

391
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:04,997
Dr Thorne.

392
00:26:06,126 --> 00:26:10,722
Peter, I've just remembered
we still have that vacancy at the Treasury.

393
00:26:10,886 --> 00:26:13,400
I've been racking my brains how to fill it,

394
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:16,842
but your work on this paper
has impressed me enormously.

395
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:19,514
You're not trying to get rid of me?

396
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:22,484
Definitely not. Quite the reverse.

397
00:26:22,686 --> 00:26:24,677
It's a terrific step up.

398
00:26:24,886 --> 00:26:27,275
But thoroughly merited.

399
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:30,444
How can I take it if it means dropping my bill?

400
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:33,160
Peter, sit down.

401
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:36,005
Let me be absolutely honest with you.

402
00:26:37,926 --> 00:26:43,398
This legislation would have been...would be...
will be very difficult to get through.

403
00:26:44,006 --> 00:26:47,999
The Treasury is the stumbling block,
not the Department of Health.

404
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:51,681
It'll take longer,
but if you were inside learning the ropes,

405
00:26:51,846 --> 00:26:57,125
we'd have a much better chance of a watertight,
foolproof Act when it gets to the statute book.

406
00:26:57,286 --> 00:27:00,562
- Believe me.
- So my proposals aren't dropped?

407
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:03,555
Absolutely not.

408
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:07,556
- 0K. I'll take the Treasury job.
- Good.

409
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:10,360
Thanks a lot. Goodbye, Prime Minister.

410
00:27:15,846 --> 00:27:19,839
That leaves us with a vacancy
at the Department of Health. Now...

411
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:22,520
The Minister for Sport is here, Prime Minister.

412
00:27:24,206 --> 00:27:26,595
- Come in.
- Mr Potts!

413
00:27:27,086 --> 00:27:29,520
Leslie! My dear chap.

414
00:27:30,886 --> 00:27:33,400
Sit down. Now...

415
00:27:34,526 --> 00:27:37,723
How would you like to be Minister of Health?

416
00:27:42,926 --> 00:27:45,440
- Me?
- Yes.

417
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:47,525
Well...

418
00:27:47,686 --> 00:27:50,405
It's a considerable promotion.

419
00:27:50,566 --> 00:27:52,796
But thoroughly merited.

420
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:58,640
You're very suitable for the job. You're not
one of the medical lobby like Dr Peter Thorne.

421
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:04,402
Well, of course I can't refuse it.
Thank you, Prime Minister.

422
00:28:05,246 --> 00:28:07,840
Humphrey, meet our new Minister for Health.

423
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:10,361
Oh, congratulations.

424
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:15,116
I don't want the job
if it means attacking the tobacco industry.

425
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,317
Ah, but it wouldn't.

426
00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:21,115
You see, Leslie,
we in government have to be realists.

427
00:28:21,286 --> 00:28:24,403
I want you to work WITH the tobacco industry.

428
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:27,080
They're only trying to sort out the problems.

429
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:32,764
They've got huge resources, nice chaps,
caring people and really fabulous employers.

430
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:35,995
They are really trying to help.

431
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:39,761
I want you to work with the industry, not against it.

432
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:42,875
- (C0UGHS)
- All right?

433
00:28:45,566 --> 00:28:47,557
What did he say?

434
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,194
I think he said, ''Yes, Prime Minister.''
