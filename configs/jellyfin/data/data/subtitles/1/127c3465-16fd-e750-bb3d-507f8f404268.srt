1
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,646
What's up, Dad?

2
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,326
What do you mean?

3
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:39,966
You're smiling.

4
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:44,246
Yeah.

5
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,126
Weird, isn't it?

6
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:54,046
Attorney-General Joe Sandilands

7
00:01:54,206 --> 00:01:57,366
has confirmed that he is
one of 14 state MPs

8
00:01:57,526 --> 00:02:01,006
who has regularly attended
the exclusive Darlinghurst brothel

9
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,886
known as Club Jules.

10
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:06,126
Footage of Mr Sandilands
leaving the brothel

11
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:08,686
was released via YouTube last night.

12
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:10,606
In a statement released
this morning,

13
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:13,366
the Attorney-General expressed
“deep regret'...

14
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:15,686
Oh, Joe. You poor bastard.

15
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:17,246
..and his colleagues.

16
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:19,646
The Premier is yet
to make a statement.

17
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,126
No luck, I'm afraid.

18
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:22,766
You're kidding me.

19
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:26,206
No-one on this floor
has a single Panadol?

20
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:32,246
Panamax? Disprin? Aspirin? Codeine,
Nurofen in one form or another?

21
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:35,246
I'll take it anally, if required.
What can I say?

22
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:39,686
This floor is loaded with
booze, coke, sex toys, debt...

23
00:02:39,846 --> 00:02:42,966
I don't need my résumé
shouted back at me, woman.

24
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:48,166
I just need something to kill
the bastard behind my eyes.

25
00:02:49,926 --> 00:02:52,166
You right?
I'm right.

26
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:57,286
Gun?
Check.

27
00:02:57,446 --> 00:02:58,806
Knife?

28
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:00,606
Check.

29
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:01,606
Stockings?

30
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:03,086
You're in charge of
the stockings, Tones.

31
00:03:03,246 --> 00:03:04,726
Bullshit I was!

32
00:03:11,886 --> 00:03:13,446
Good evening.

33
00:03:13,606 --> 00:03:16,886
Uh... Oh...

34
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:20,526
I have the stepmother
of all headaches.

35
00:03:20,686 --> 00:03:23,006
A headache, you say.

36
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:28,006
Yes.

37
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,566
I'd like something strong for it,
if possible.

38
00:03:31,726 --> 00:03:34,006
I'll be with you in a moment.

39
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:46,406
Put your fucking
hands in the air now! Do as you're told.

40
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:47,966
Open the fucking till.
Hurry up here!

41
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:49,846
Fellas, what are you doing?
Open it!

42
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:52,126
Boys, you're on ‘Candid Camera'.

43
00:03:52,286 --> 00:03:53,326
Shut up! Hurry up, mate.

44
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:55,606
I'd just cut my losses
and bolt if I were you.

45
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:58,446
I won't say a word.
Put your hands in the air.

46
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,606
Is that branch loaded, mate?
Shut up, smart arse.

47
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:04,126
I know a thing or two about the law —
not much, granted —

48
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,806
but if you just bolt now...

49
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:07,806
Oh!

50
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,286
Hurry up!
It won't come out!

51
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:11,006
What are you doing?
I can't get it open.

52
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,006
Leave it. Let's go. Come on!
Stay down.

53
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,846
Hurry up, Tones. Hurry up!
Let's go. Come on!

54
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:16,966
Aargh!

55
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:20,326
Oh, fuck! Tones, get up!
Tones, come on!

56
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:23,846
Tones! Tones! Come on, man!

57
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:35,166
You're in luck.
This should do the trick.

58
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:42,886
Fucking hell. Oh, fuck. Fu...

59
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:09,846
Where's my parade?

60
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:12,086
I beg your pardon?

61
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:16,286
He gets called a hero, he gets a safe
seat in Parliament, he gets my girl.

62
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:17,766
Ow!

63
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:19,606
What do I get?

64
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:20,966
Hello?

65
00:05:21,126 --> 00:05:22,686
Barn?

66
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:24,806
So are you gonna die?

67
00:05:24,966 --> 00:05:27,646
Well, I've been thinking a bit
about it lately.

68
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:29,886
Barn!

69
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:32,246
Don't ever pull this stunt again.

70
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:34,086
I'm not your next of kin.

71
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:37,206
In fact, I couldn't imagine
a worse fate.

72
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:39,046
I had a mental blank.

73
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:42,726
You just don't get it, do you?

74
00:05:42,886 --> 00:05:46,126
We don't exist any longer, Cleaver.

75
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:49,126
I'm not gonna bail you out
or loan you any more money

76
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:53,126
or listen to you rationalise
your pathetic self-indulgences.

77
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,846
Alright. If you can't get over
a little grudge...

78
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:59,086
A little grudge?!

79
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:01,726
He screwed my wife.

80
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:08,206
Barn, it's you and me, mate.
Come on, we can get over this.

81
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:14,166
I'm already over it, ‘mate'.

82
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:16,646
I'm over it.

83
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:19,326
I'm over Scarlet and I'm over you.

84
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:22,526
Ta-ta.

85
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:24,326
Sorry, this might be
a little... .tight.

86
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:26,286
Oh! Fuck!

87
00:06:38,406 --> 00:06:40,526
Until I'm informed otherwise,

88
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:43,086
this is OUR house
and they are OUR children.

89
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:44,726
OK.

90
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:57,086
Have you seen this?

91
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,646
“Glebe woman bashed and robbed.”

92
00:07:00,806 --> 00:07:02,606
No, below that.

93
00:07:02,766 --> 00:07:04,766
“Barista assaul...

94
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:08,646
“Barista assaulted
in Kings Cross chemist.”

95
00:07:08,806 --> 00:07:09,646
Pretty funny.

96
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,486
You haven't made a cup of coffee for
yourself since I've known you.

97
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:14,686
How come Glebe woman
gets a bigger story than me?

98
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:16,326
I mean, she's...Glebe woman.

99
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:18,926
Her only significant achievement's
having an address.

100
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:20,886
I at least have a profession.

101
00:07:21,046 --> 00:07:23,446
Ah! I'd kill for a skinny latte right now,
thanks.

102
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:27,046
And how come Glebe woman
gets ‘bashed' and I get ‘assaulted'?

103
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:29,286
I mean, ‘bashed'
sounds so much worse.

104
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:32,406
Oh, it's a blessing in disguise.
It's a bloody good disguise.

105
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:34,486
You're briefed to appear for
Travis Simon Tanner,

106
00:07:34,646 --> 00:07:37,806
who is alleged to have
assaulted and robbed...

107
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:39,446
Glebe woman.

108
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:42,046
I'm gonna get the bugger off.

109
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:44,926
She's gonna find out who's boss.

110
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:48,526
Show Glebe woman what it's like
to be below the fold.

111
00:07:48,686 --> 00:07:50,086
Yes, you do that.

112
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:52,766
Oh, by the way,
can I have a muffin to go?

113
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:58,366
He's 19. He has two priors
as a juvenile for...

114
00:07:58,526 --> 00:08:00,806
Violent assault and robbery.

115
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:01,966
Excellent.

116
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:04,766
Just got out of Grafton. This is
his first charge as an adult.

117
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:07,606
I'm not even gonna try and hide
my disappointment, Simone.

118
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:10,286
I was hoping our Mr Tanner
might be innocent.

119
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:12,206
See, I have a score to settle.

120
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,286
Well, before you fall into
a deep despond,

121
00:08:14,446 --> 00:08:17,046
it seems very possible that
the police may have jumped the gun

122
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,526
and picked up an easy target.

123
00:08:18,686 --> 00:08:20,206
How so?

124
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,766
Because, whilst our Mr Tanner
does fit the description

125
00:08:22,926 --> 00:08:27,006
given by Ms...Jah...Jajou?

126
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,726
Jajou, Jajou.
Yep, yep, Glebe woman.

127
00:08:28,886 --> 00:08:29,726
Quite.

128
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:32,126
..we have a witness who says
she saw him in the city

129
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:34,966
at precisely the time the attack was
alleged to have taken place

130
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:36,926
in Glebe on...

131
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:38,526
Glebe woman.

132
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,086
Really?
Yes.

133
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:43,766
And this, you see,
is how you came to get this brief.

134
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:45,166
How?

135
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:47,686
Apparently, the witness
is a friend of yours.

136
00:08:47,846 --> 00:08:49,606
Who?

137
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:52,646
It was about 8:00.

138
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:55,326
I was late to meet David,
so I bolted out onto Phillip Street.

139
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:57,126
And — wham! — we collided.

140
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,886
I dropped everything.

141
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:01,446
He was very apologetic
and helped me pick up my stuff.

142
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:04,526
And we chatted for a minute
and introduced ourselves.

143
00:09:04,686 --> 00:09:06,526
He told you his name?
Yeah.

144
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:08,086
Travis. Travis Tanner.

145
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,446
Next morning,
I'm listening to the radio.

146
00:09:10,606 --> 00:09:12,966
And after all that bullshit
about the election,

147
00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:16,006
I hear this story about
this woman from Glebe...

148
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:17,886
Glebe woman.
Yeah.

149
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:19,726
..who was assaulted about 8:00

150
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:21,966
and that a Travis Tanner
had been charged.

151
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:25,486
Right, nothing on the radio about
a barista from Kings Cross?

152
00:09:25,646 --> 00:09:27,046
No.

153
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:30,326
Anyway, I thought, “There can't be that
many Travis Tanners.”

154
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,686
So I give the Crown defender's
office a call

155
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:36,286
and I get his solicitor's name
and I tell her what I saw.

156
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:37,406
And?

157
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:42,846
And Simone and I got chatting
and I mentioned your name and...

158
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:45,846
Uh, any distinguishing features?

159
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:51,326
Yeah, a barbed wire tatt
on his shoulder. His left, I think.

160
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:55,126
I gotta get back.
OK.

161
00:09:55,286 --> 00:09:56,606
OK.

162
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:58,206
You know this is proof, don't you?

163
00:09:58,366 --> 00:09:59,886
Proof of what?

164
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:01,726
Proof of our spiritual connection.

165
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:06,686
We both withessed assaults
on the same night.

166
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:10,566
In some cultures,
we'd be forced to marry.

167
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:12,566
Well, I guess we're lucky
we live in a city

168
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:14,686
where the spiritual
doesn't count for much.

169
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:32,726
What were you doing
in Phillip Street, Travis?

170
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:35,926
Um, staying in some shit hole
near Central.

171
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:38,046
The halfway house?
Yep.

172
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:41,926
I went down to see the harbour
and the bridge and that.

173
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:44,486
Right, were you gonna meet
some mates down there?

174
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:48,926
Nuh. Just...wanted to see the blue.

175
00:10:49,086 --> 00:10:50,966
The colour blue?
Yeah.

176
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:53,486
But it wasn't sunny that day,
was it?

177
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:55,646
Night before,
the forecast was sweet.

178
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:59,206
Fine and sunny all day, but...
they're all just full of shit.

179
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:02,526
Oh, don't get me started on
weathermen, mate.

180
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:05,086
How long did you stay
down by the harbour?

181
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:08,566
Probably...most of the day.

182
00:11:08,726 --> 00:11:11,126
Despite the absence of
the colour blue.

183
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:13,406
Blue would've been nice, but...

184
00:11:14,486 --> 00:11:16,686
I've just gotta walk around
like a regular bloke.

185
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:18,166
Hmm.

186
00:11:18,326 --> 00:11:21,286
The sun went down
and I just stared at the lights.

187
00:11:21,446 --> 00:11:23,086
It was good.

188
00:11:23,246 --> 00:11:26,846
And then you, uh, just walked back
to the old halfway house.

189
00:11:27,006 --> 00:11:28,646
Yep.

190
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:30,126
Past the law school.

191
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:32,006
Why did you go that way?

192
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:36,926
I don't know Sydney
that well. I'm from Taree.

193
00:11:37,086 --> 00:11:39,886
But it was outside the law school
you bumped into Miss Partridge.

194
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:41,726
Well, they tell me it was
a law school.

195
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:44,446
I wouldn't know
what the fuck it was.

196
00:11:44,606 --> 00:11:46,886
Yeah. It's a law school.

197
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:54,910
http://hiqve.com/

198
00:11:55,806 --> 00:11:58,206
Mick. Col.

199
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:00,566
Can we have a private word?

200
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:05,166
We heard what happened
the other night at the chemist's.

201
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:06,726
Oh, yeah, you read the papers.

202
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:09,326
Yep. Couldn't grab us a short black,
could you, mate?

203
00:12:10,486 --> 00:12:12,966
One of the boys just happens to be
the son of good friend of mine.

204
00:12:13,126 --> 00:12:14,126
Ah!

205
00:12:14,286 --> 00:12:16,206
The one who clobbered you.
Ah.

206
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:19,246
Ah, indeed.
Not me for a change, hey, Cleave?

207
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:23,526
Yeah, that's right.
So do I get a credit?

208
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:28,686
The thing is, mate,
the other kid, Tony, he's dead.

209
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:32,366
Turns out he had some sort of
congenital brain defect.

210
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:34,606
Shit.
No shit.

211
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:36,966
Well, I didn't need a neurosurgeon
to tell me that.

212
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:38,566
They're both fucking idiots.

213
00:12:38,726 --> 00:12:40,046
And, you know, the pair of them

214
00:12:40,206 --> 00:12:41,846
have always been embarrassments
to their families.

215
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:43,366
Fuckin' pot heads.

216
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:46,126
But Josh, fair fuckin' dinkum,

217
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:51,006
even before he started on the weed,
he was just plain dumb.

218
00:12:52,086 --> 00:12:54,886
His father's a very, very good friend
of mine.

219
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:57,326
Best break-and-enter man
in the business.

220
00:12:57,486 --> 00:13:00,406
So I need to know
what really happened, Cleave.

221
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:03,446
Oh, well, look,
I was still a bit woozy,

222
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:06,486
but, um...but I vaguely remember
one of them clobbering

223
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:08,366
the security camera with
a lump of wood

224
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:09,846
and hitting the other one...

225
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:10,846
Tony.

226
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:13,166
..Tony, in the follow-through.

227
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,846
He didn't mean to do it.
It's manslaughter at worst.

228
00:13:16,006 --> 00:13:17,326
Good.

229
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:19,886
His father thinks a stretch
for manslaughter will sort him out.

230
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:21,446
Teach him the trade.
Yeah.

231
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:24,926
But murder? No.

232
00:13:25,086 --> 00:13:26,886
His mother couldn't handle that.

233
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:31,166
Barney's missus has been briefed
for the prosecution.

234
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:33,286
Will that be a problem?
Well, not for me, mate.

235
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,046
Golden rule —
you can't cross-examine a friend.

236
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,686
How are you?

237
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:46,886
Thanks for coming.
Oh! That's alright.

238
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:50,286
Can't really trust the phones
at the moment.

239
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:52,166
How are you going?

240
00:13:54,406 --> 00:13:57,446
Sal's given me two weeks
to find a new place.

241
00:13:57,606 --> 00:13:59,486
Taken the kids to Bowral
until I move out.

242
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:01,926
She didn't know?

243
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:04,046
She knew. Course she knew.

244
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:09,126
It's not what I did. It's the humiliation
that she can't handle.

245
00:14:10,286 --> 00:14:12,686
Spoken to Jules?
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:14:12,846 --> 00:14:14,486
I tried calling her, but...

247
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,606
Well, she's lying understandably low.

248
00:14:17,766 --> 00:14:20,726
There's a lot of
pretty pissed-off people.

249
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:22,406
What happened?

250
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:24,326
Someone hacked into the system.

251
00:14:24,486 --> 00:14:27,566
You know, got the client list,
recognised a few names.

252
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:30,046
If they got the client list,
then they...

253
00:14:30,206 --> 00:14:32,886
No, no, it's alright.
You don't need to worry.

254
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:35,246
It's not the girls they're interested in.
It's the celebs.

255
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:38,366
You know, and the chances of anyone
putting two and two together

256
00:14:38,526 --> 00:14:39,846
are a million to one.

257
00:14:40,006 --> 00:14:42,566
I don't like those odds
in this town.

258
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:46,646
Have you thought of telling David?

259
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:50,366
We're too far down the track, Joe.

260
00:14:56,886 --> 00:14:58,726
You OK?

261
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:03,206
Sick of the bullshit.
Hmm.

262
00:15:03,366 --> 00:15:06,366
Sick of the bullshit.

263
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,446
Tell me, what... When we were, um...

264
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:18,326
..together at the club,
did you ever enjoy it?

265
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:21,246
We had a lot of laughs.

266
00:15:21,406 --> 00:15:23,766
Yeah, I know we had a lot of laughs,

267
00:15:23,926 --> 00:15:27,406
but...the whole thing —
did you ever...

268
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,646
Joe, let's not dwell on...
Didn't think so.

269
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:34,366
That's not what I meant.
That's exactly what you meant.

270
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:36,926
Ah, Cleaver was always
the one for you, wasn't he?

271
00:15:37,086 --> 00:15:38,686
Oh, don't be stupid.
No, I...

272
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:41,086
I remember Jules's drinks parties.

273
00:15:41,246 --> 00:15:45,766
Your face would light up
when Cleaver came in.

274
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:47,526
Hey? Off his tree.

275
00:15:47,686 --> 00:15:51,086
As he invariably was.

276
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:54,086
And then I'd go and look for you
a little later on

277
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:55,846
and you'd both be gone.

278
00:15:57,726 --> 00:15:59,206
Did you fall in love with him?

279
00:16:00,366 --> 00:16:02,126
Once or twice.

280
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:06,086
But to use an expression
Cleaver's fond of,

281
00:16:06,246 --> 00:16:08,126
he's a hopeless case.

282
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:09,966
Hmm, another expression
that he's fond of —

283
00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:14,366
hopeless cases are the only ones
worth fighting for.

284
00:16:19,006 --> 00:16:21,126
You ever tell him what you felt?

285
00:16:30,886 --> 00:16:32,806
Hmm!

286
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:44,646
“For all sad words of tongue and pen,

287
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:47,366
“the saddest are these —

288
00:16:47,526 --> 00:16:49,006
“it might have been.”

289
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:05,766
You've already made
a joint decision to divorce.

290
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:09,206
What is it you seek to achieve
by coming to therapy?

291
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:15,606
It's for the children, primarily.

292
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:17,926
We've moved on from each other.

293
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:23,166
So we...we thought it would be a good
idea to see if someone could help us.

294
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:25,966
- Hmm, help them.
- Yeah, help the children.

295
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:27,566
That's who I meant by ‘them'.

296
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:30,726
I was just trying to be clear.
I think it was already pretty clear.

297
00:17:30,886 --> 00:17:34,166
You could've been clearer.
Alright. I'm sorry.

298
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:43,046
Alright, what were you playing at?

299
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:44,566
What do you mean?

300
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:48,366
Well, this Zen facade
is a little wearing.

301
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,766
It's not a facade.
Oh, bullshit.

302
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:52,886
I feel OK, Scarlet.

303
00:17:53,046 --> 00:17:54,966
It's as much a surprise to me.

304
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:57,606
I just...I feel OK.

305
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:00,766
The fog has lifted.
No pain, no anger.

306
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:03,646
Just a desire and a need to move on.

307
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:05,766
So...?

308
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:07,846
So we move on.

309
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:11,926
It's what you want, right?
Yeah.

310
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:14,166
OK.

311
00:18:21,606 --> 00:18:26,286
Ah, yes. I told you the patches
wouldn't work, Darver.

312
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:28,686
The only way the patches
are gonna work, mate,

313
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:30,486
is if you want to quit smoking.

314
00:18:30,646 --> 00:18:32,686
And you don't want to quit smoking.

315
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:35,686
You're a committed smoker. So be it.

316
00:18:35,846 --> 00:18:38,686
You're also one of the nation's
top silks,

317
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:41,366
so you shouldn't be reduced
to hanging around

318
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:43,046
in fucking toilet cubicles,

319
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,086
puffing away like
some adolescent boy.

320
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:48,886
So come on, mate. Be a man.
Out and proud.

321
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:52,046
Jesus Christ. Give it
a fucking rest, will you?

322
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:54,926
You pricks are all the same.

323
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:58,366
You can't even have a piss
without talking shit.

324
00:18:58,526 --> 00:19:02,406
Yes. Uh, sorry,
I mistook you for somebody else.

325
00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:08,086
I'm meeting some prick
called Greene. Where's he at?

326
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,886
Uh, yes.

327
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:15,766
The prick Greene is, uh, down
the corridor to the left, left again,

328
00:19:15,926 --> 00:19:17,566
then straight ahead.

329
00:19:17,726 --> 00:19:20,766
Look for a door marked ‘Tolga Urdan'.

330
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:29,086
Now, where was I?

331
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:39,766
Ms Tanner, did you visit Travis
when he was in Grafton?

332
00:19:39,926 --> 00:19:40,926
Once or twice.

333
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:42,486
Look, he know what he done.

334
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:44,966
If you can't do the time,
then don't do the fucking crime.

335
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:48,366
Yeah, it's just that this is your son's first
charge as an adult.

336
00:19:48,526 --> 00:19:50,606
If it goes badly, it's gonna
have a really big impact

337
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:52,086
on the rest of his life.

338
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:54,846
We're here, aren't we?
Just tell us what you want us to say.

339
00:19:55,006 --> 00:19:56,846
It doesn't work that way,
Mrs Tanner.

340
00:19:57,006 --> 00:19:59,806
Oh, doesn't it?
You must be new at this, love.

341
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:06,486
♪ When I, good friends, was call'd to the bar

342
00:20:06,646 --> 00:20:08,686

00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:10,726

A statement issued by
the family this afternoon, Sandra,

352
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:01,966
stated that Mr Sandilands

his regular attendance

354
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:06,806
at a now infamous Sydney brothel.

355
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:09,726

Joe.

367
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:13,086
Hey.

368
00:23:13,246 --> 00:23:14,606
Hi.

369
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:17,766
I don't think I've got another tear
left in me, Barn.

370
00:23:19,486 --> 00:23:21,486
I know how you feel, Sal.

371
00:23:22,686 --> 00:23:25,566
You don't see how
it could ever not hurt.

372
00:23:25,726 --> 00:23:28,166
You resign yourself to
living with the pain.

373
00:23:29,446 --> 00:23:34,566
But then one day you wake up
and it's gone. Hmm?

374
00:23:34,726 --> 00:23:38,006
And you begin again.

375
00:23:47,766 --> 00:23:51,086
I'm having dinner for Fuzz's birthday
at my place if you're free.

376
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:52,766
Yeah, great.

377
00:23:52,926 --> 00:23:54,406
She's coming.

378
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,606
Who? Your mother?

379
00:23:56,766 --> 00:24:00,766
Vampira.
Ah.

380
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:06,566
I've been thinking about my epitaph.

381
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:08,166
And?

382
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:11,566
I think I'm going to go with
American Typewriter.

383
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:13,526
I'm sorry?

384
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,366
The font.

385
00:24:15,526 --> 00:24:18,606
I've got no idea what it's gonna say,
but it'll look nice.

386
00:24:23,486 --> 00:24:25,926
I was watching you
chatting to Scarlet.

387
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:29,126
I had a sort of Proustian rush.

388
00:24:29,286 --> 00:24:32,206
It was like it was 15 years ago

389
00:24:32,366 --> 00:24:34,326
and we were all
at some party together.

390
00:24:34,486 --> 00:24:36,046
I'd be acting the fool

391
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:39,206
and you two and Barney
would be rolling your eyes.

392
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:41,046
Fuck, I miss it.

393
00:24:46,126 --> 00:24:48,086
Lost you all.

394
00:24:50,126 --> 00:24:52,246
Two of the most important things
a man can have —

395
00:24:52,406 --> 00:24:54,326
a loving wife and dear friends —

396
00:24:54,486 --> 00:24:56,726
I've somehow managed
to lose all of you.

397
00:24:56,886 --> 00:24:59,446
I fucking love you all.

398
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:04,766
Most of all, you.

399
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:16,726
Hmm.

400
00:25:23,206 --> 00:25:24,646
What are you doing?

401
00:25:24,806 --> 00:25:28,286
Just making a bad situation worse.

402
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:33,126
Get out of the car.

403
00:25:33,286 --> 00:25:35,486
Wendy...
Get out of the car, please.

404
00:26:05,006 --> 00:26:08,686
Did you see the list of so-called
celebrities from the club

405
00:26:08,846 --> 00:26:10,206
they put in the paper?

406
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:14,326
It's a bloody outrage. 30 names.
Did I get a mention?

407
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:17,526
I'm only a founding member.

408
00:26:18,566 --> 00:26:21,846
I'm surprised Glebe woman
didn't get a guernsey.

409
00:26:22,006 --> 00:26:26,166
I don't know what's going on.
I feel like a victim of identity theft.

410
00:26:26,326 --> 00:26:28,326
Who'd wanna be me?

411
00:26:38,686 --> 00:26:40,886
Eh? Some money, eh?

412
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:43,886
Here you go.
That's for you.

413
00:26:56,686 --> 00:26:58,646
I'll have a Scotch, mate.

414
00:27:03,046 --> 00:27:05,886
Joe was just sick of the bullshit,
I think.

415
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,686
I'll drink to that.

416
00:27:13,486 --> 00:27:16,686
I saw him the morning he jumped,
Cleave.

417
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:20,926
Oh.

418
00:27:23,406 --> 00:27:26,326
Don't flatter yourself, babe.
There was nothing you could've done.

419
00:27:26,486 --> 00:27:28,846
Wasn't there?
No, there wasn't.

420
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:31,326
He sounded so lost.

421
00:27:32,646 --> 00:27:36,326
He was sick of the bullshit —
that's what it was.

422
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:38,886
Well, I'm tired of it too.

423
00:27:39,046 --> 00:27:44,846
Ugh! Fuck, Cleave!
I'm not even 30 and I'm tired of it.

424
00:27:45,846 --> 00:27:48,566
Every day with David, at some point,

425
00:27:48,726 --> 00:27:50,486
I have to pretend
to be someone I'm not.

426
00:27:50,646 --> 00:27:54,766
I've lied to him about you,
about Joe, about the club.

427
00:27:54,926 --> 00:27:57,086
I mean, it's exhausting.

428
00:27:57,246 --> 00:28:02,686
Well, then, tell him the truth. Fuck!

429
00:28:02,846 --> 00:28:04,646
See how he takes it.

430
00:28:04,806 --> 00:28:08,206
If you can't be real with him,
what's the fucking point?

431
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:11,366
You're real with me.

432
00:28:12,446 --> 00:28:14,766
Yeah. Yeah, right.

433
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:21,846
What? I'm serious.
You're real with me.

434
00:28:22,006 --> 00:28:26,806
Who do you feel more real with,
him or me?

435
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:29,166
It's not that simple.
Isn't it?

436
00:28:51,366 --> 00:28:53,566
You know the rules, baby.

437
00:28:53,726 --> 00:28:56,846
Nah, it's my first time, actually.
Really?

438
00:28:57,006 --> 00:28:59,926
Mmm. So how much for a kiss?

439
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:02,246
You got cash?

440
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:04,046
Yeah. How much?

441
00:29:05,886 --> 00:29:07,366
200.

442
00:29:10,326 --> 00:29:12,406
You always carry
that much cash with you?

443
00:29:12,566 --> 00:29:15,246
I've been at a funeral.

Yeah. Vince. How are you, mate?
Good to see you.

- I don't know him.

You know Mr Meagher, don't you?
We do, Cleave.

Yeah.
We need him out of the fountain.

00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:33,646
- I don't know him.
- Get out of there!

471
00:30:33,806 --> 00:30:36,006
He's alright. We've just been
to Joe Sandilands's wake.

472
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,886
So he's a bit tired and emotional.

Yeah, he'll be alright.
He'll come with me.

Listen to your friend.

I'll look aft... I'll get him out.
He's right.

Get out, you bloody idiot.

483
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:10,366
You are gonna owe me big-time.

484
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:16,326
What time do you call this?

485
00:31:18,446 --> 00:31:20,006
Where have you been?

486
00:31:24,326 --> 00:31:26,126
Mourning a friend.

487
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:29,166
You only met Joe
a few months ago, Mel.

488
00:31:29,326 --> 00:31:32,006
How drunk do you get
when someone you actually know dies?

489
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,366
I'm sick of this crap.

490
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:45,086
This self-indulgent,
Paris Hilton crap.

491
00:31:45,246 --> 00:31:46,886
Paris Hilton?!

492
00:31:47,046 --> 00:31:49,366
You're comparing me
with Paris Hilton?

493
00:31:49,526 --> 00:31:53,006
You disappear, Mel, all the time.
You fucking disappear.

494
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:54,486
Dinners, lunches.

495
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,126
I take a nap,
you're gone three hours.

496
00:31:56,286 --> 00:31:58,566
At first, I thought
it was this charming idiosyncrasy,

497
00:31:58,726 --> 00:32:01,566
a sort of Audrey Hepburn
in ‘Breakfast at Tiffany's.

498
00:32:01,726 --> 00:32:04,326
But it's no longer charming,
nor is it idiosyncratic.

499
00:32:04,486 --> 00:32:08,246
It is childish, self-indulgent,
thoughtless bullshit.

500
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:13,846
Not only are we getting married,
but I'm running for Parliament.

501
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:17,526
So I'm sorry, but I really
need to know where you were.

502
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:21,246
You said that your political career
wouldn't interfere with my choices,

503
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,886
that I could do my own thing.

504
00:32:23,046 --> 00:32:25,806
Where were you last night?!

505
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:30,886
And don't try and get out of it
by giving me another fucking story

506
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:32,686
about your dead parents.

507
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:52,406
Come on, mate. Come on. Drink up.

508
00:32:52,566 --> 00:32:54,246
Oh!

509
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:56,686
That's it. Bit more.
Oh, no.

510
00:33:03,206 --> 00:33:05,526
I tried being you tonight.

511
00:33:06,726 --> 00:33:08,046
And?

512
00:33:08,206 --> 00:33:11,046
Christ, it must be awful.

513
00:33:11,206 --> 00:33:14,166
Yeah, tell me about it.

514
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:18,446
I ended up in one of those bars,
the sort of places you go to.

515
00:33:20,526 --> 00:33:25,406
And I paid this woman 200 bucks
to kiss me.

516
00:33:28,366 --> 00:33:30,126
I've been feeling fine.

517
00:33:30,286 --> 00:33:35,886
Here I was in this dark room,
strange woman, kissing her.

518
00:33:37,606 --> 00:33:39,926
And it all came back to me.

519
00:33:41,046 --> 00:33:42,486
Like a flood.

520
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,246
What did?

521
00:33:44,406 --> 00:33:49,246
The pain, the anger, the fear.

522
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:55,726
I burst into tears
and then I threw up on her.

523
00:33:55,886 --> 00:33:59,246
Oh, Jesus, Barnyard.

524
00:34:00,646 --> 00:34:02,846
200 bucks.

525
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:04,606
Why on earth, Minister,

526
00:34:04,766 --> 00:34:07,086
would you deny the fact
that you can speak French?

527
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:10,486
Were you scared that
if this sensational news got out,

528
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:12,006
it might make you look un-Australian?

529
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:14,446
Well, it doesn't make you look
un-Australian, mate.

530
00:34:14,606 --> 00:34:15,926
But I'll tell you what,

531
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:18,126
lying about it makes you look
like an imbecile.

532
00:34:18,286 --> 00:34:21,286
It's this sort of dumbing down,
constantly patronis...

533
00:34:21,446 --> 00:34:24,166
Out we get. Home, James.
Home, James. Good boy.

534
00:34:24,326 --> 00:34:25,646
Hey, just wait there for a sec.

535
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:27,886
Make yourself nice.

536
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:33,006
What have you done to him?
Me? Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

537
00:34:33,166 --> 00:34:34,606
The last time I saw him like this

538
00:34:34,766 --> 00:34:36,606
was when you took him out
for his buck's night.

539
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:39,326
You're welcome, Red.
How could you let him get like this?!

540
00:34:39,486 --> 00:34:41,726
It's nothing to do with me.
He did it all by himself.

541
00:34:41,886 --> 00:34:43,726
It's never your fault, is it?
I've been worried sick.

542
00:34:43,886 --> 00:34:46,886
It's a little late to play the concerned
wife, don't you think, Red?

543
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:49,046
How dare you? How dare you?

544
00:34:49,206 --> 00:34:50,726
We buried a good friend yesterday

545
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:52,806
and I was worried about
how Barney would handle it.

546
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,526
Or is there something wrong
with that?

547
00:34:55,566 --> 00:34:57,926
Just go, will you?
And leave my family alone.

548
00:34:59,726 --> 00:35:02,886
For what it's worth, Red,
it looks like he handled it quite well.

549
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:04,526
Fuck off!

550
00:35:05,966 --> 00:35:06,006
I think we should ask him
to redraft this.

551
00:35:06,006 --> 00:35:08,046
I think we should ask him
to redraft this.

552
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:10,166
Parts of it aren't even coherent,
let alone accurate.

553
00:35:10,326 --> 00:35:11,646
Mm-hm. Yeah, that's fine.

554
00:35:11,806 --> 00:35:15,686
Look, I've changed my mind —
I'm going to do Cleaver Greene's cross.

555
00:35:15,846 --> 00:35:19,006
But you said he was an old friend.
You can't cross-examine a friend.

556
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:20,486
I know what I'm doing.

557
00:35:20,646 --> 00:35:22,486
But you could get into
a lot of trouble.

558
00:35:43,886 --> 00:35:46,166
Mr Greene,

559
00:35:46,326 --> 00:35:50,006
you visited the pharmacy
for what purpose?

560
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:55,286
I had...
I had a headache.

561
00:35:55,446 --> 00:35:57,366
According to your statement,

562
00:35:57,526 --> 00:36:00,326
the defendant
and his now-deceased accomplice,

563
00:36:00,486 --> 00:36:04,606
they entered the pharmacy
approximately two minutes after you.

564
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:07,766
The two of them
then attempted to rob the pharmacy.

565
00:36:07,926 --> 00:36:10,006
Yes, that's right.

566
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:13,566
The accused beat you over the head
with a log, did he not?

567
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:15,126
He did.

568
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:18,886
Severely enough to see you off
to Emergency at St Vincent's.

569
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:20,366
Yes.

570
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:23,166
But you claim to have
remained conscious.

571
00:36:23,326 --> 00:36:27,246
Enough to see the accused
beat his friend with the log.

572
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:30,006
Yes, well, he didn't
beat him with the log.

573
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:32,766
He was trying to take out
the CCTV camera

574
00:36:32,926 --> 00:36:34,886
and he hit...it was an accident.

575
00:36:35,046 --> 00:36:37,286
Oh, an accident? Ah.

576
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:38,766
How can you be sure?

577
00:36:38,926 --> 00:36:41,646
It... I'm sure.

578
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:43,446
Had you been drinking?

579
00:36:45,046 --> 00:36:46,686
No.

580
00:36:46,846 --> 00:36:51,846
Had you been taking any illicit
substances? Cocaine, for example.

581
00:36:53,726 --> 00:36:55,246
Ms Engels?

582
00:36:55,406 --> 00:36:56,486
Credit, Your Honour.

583
00:36:56,646 --> 00:36:59,646
Short leash.
Thank you, Your Honour.

584
00:37:01,206 --> 00:37:02,886
Do you need me
to repeat the question?

585
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:04,526
No.

586
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:07,526
And the answer is no.

587
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:10,846
Mr Greene, have you ever been
to rehab for cocaine addiction?

588
00:37:13,486 --> 00:37:14,526
Yes.

589
00:37:14,686 --> 00:37:16,486
And when was that?

590
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:19,846
Two years ago.

591
00:37:20,006 --> 00:37:22,566
Have you taken cocaine
since you were discharged from rehab?

592
00:37:22,726 --> 00:37:24,766
Oh, are you gonna object
at some point, Rumpole?

593
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:26,846
Uh, objection, Your Honour.

594
00:37:27,006 --> 00:37:28,526
Sustained.

595
00:37:30,286 --> 00:37:33,846
Mr Greene, you're a known associate of
Mr Michael Corella, are you not?

596
00:37:36,646 --> 00:37:39,286
Yes, I defended him.

597
00:37:39,446 --> 00:37:44,806
And Mr Corella is...is a friend
of the accused's father, isn't he?

598
00:37:46,206 --> 00:37:47,286
Yes.

599
00:37:47,446 --> 00:37:52,926
Mr Greene, do you currently
owe Mr Corella any money?

600
00:37:54,206 --> 00:37:55,846
Gambling debts, perhaps.

601
00:37:57,846 --> 00:38:01,926
Your Honour, I have had
sexual relations with that woman.

602
00:38:02,086 --> 00:38:04,126
She is my best friend's wife

603
00:38:04,286 --> 00:38:06,086
and she should not be
cross-examining me.

604
00:38:06,246 --> 00:38:08,046
Your Honour, this is intolerable.

605
00:38:08,206 --> 00:38:10,366
I completely agree with
my co-copulator, Your Honour.

606
00:38:10,526 --> 00:38:12,486
And plus, I've got another trial
kicking off...

607
00:38:12,646 --> 00:38:14,446
Enough!
..SiX minutes.

608
00:38:15,806 --> 00:38:18,646
Ms Engels, my chambers. Now.

609
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:36,646
Delighted you could make it...
Your Honour.

610
00:38:36,806 --> 00:38:38,166
..Mr Greene.

611
00:38:38,326 --> 00:38:40,606
Only you and Beyoncé
have the pulling power.

612
00:38:40,766 --> 00:38:42,566
Shall we, then?

613
00:38:42,726 --> 00:38:44,446
Let's.

614
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:47,606
So after the assault,

615
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:51,166
this so-called Glebe woman
called the police

616
00:38:51,326 --> 00:38:52,646
and you attended the scene.

617
00:38:52,806 --> 00:38:55,486
Mrs Jejora's from Annandale, actually.

618
00:38:55,646 --> 00:38:56,966
I beg your pardon?

619
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,406
The attack was in Glebe.
She's from Annandale.

620
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:00,886
Are you sure?

621
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:04,646
I mean, the press was most insistent
that she was a Glebe woman.

622
00:39:04,806 --> 00:39:08,206
Well, as I say, the attack
was in Glebe, so I guess...

623
00:39:08,366 --> 00:39:10,526
Mr Greene, is this at all relevant?

624
00:39:10,686 --> 00:39:13,046
I'll move on, Your Honour.

625
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:21,646
So, uh, the pensioner
formerly known as Glebe woman

626
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:24,526
was able to give you a description
of her assailant, was she?

627
00:39:24,686 --> 00:39:28,086
Mr Greene, the victim's name
is Mrs Jejora.

628
00:39:29,926 --> 00:39:32,006
Please answer the question, Constable.

629
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:33,486
Yes.

630
00:39:33,646 --> 00:39:39,006
Constable, how did the assailant attack
Mrs, uh, Jejora?

631
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,726
If that's her name.

632
00:39:40,886 --> 00:39:43,726
I'm sorry, Mr Greene?
Nothing, Your Honour.

633
00:39:43,886 --> 00:39:45,766
Constable? Please.

634
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:49,006
She said he attacked her
from behind.

635
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:55,406
Oh, so 71-year-old Mrs Jejora
was able to give you a description

636
00:39:55,566 --> 00:39:57,566
of the man who attacked her
from BEHIND?

637
00:39:57,726 --> 00:39:59,046
Amongst other things,

638
00:39:59,206 --> 00:40:03,286
she was able to describe a tattoo
on her assailant's left arm.

639
00:40:03,446 --> 00:40:06,366
Yes, the barbed wire.
Yes.

640
00:40:06,526 --> 00:40:09,126
Yes. A barbed wire tattoo.

641
00:40:09,286 --> 00:40:10,806
Have you ever seen
one of those before

642
00:40:10,966 --> 00:40:12,286
in your entire career, Constable?

643
00:40:12,446 --> 00:40:14,966
Yes.

644
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:16,966
How many times would you estimate

645
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:19,966
you might've seen
a barbed wire tattoo in your career?

646
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,526
I don't know.

647
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:23,886
More than once?

648
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,726
I suppose.

649
00:40:25,886 --> 00:40:31,646
Yes, twice? Uh, three times?
300...times?

650
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:33,406
A lot. I don't know.
Yes.

651
00:40:33,566 --> 00:40:36,806
They're as common as muck,
aren't they, Constable?

652
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:39,246
Constable, how long was the interval

653
00:40:39,406 --> 00:40:45,846
between Mrs Ja...jora's reporting
of the incident and the arrest?

654
00:40:47,766 --> 00:40:50,606
I'd have to check the charge sheet,
but I'd say...

655
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:54,126
..an hour and a half.

656
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:56,206
Well, that's extraordinary!

657
00:40:56,366 --> 00:40:59,206
Doesn't it make you feel
safe, ladies and gentlemen,

658
00:40:59,366 --> 00:41:02,046
in a town of over 4 million people,

659
00:41:02,206 --> 00:41:06,286
the constabulary can pin down
a bent needle in a haystack

660
00:41:06,446 --> 00:41:07,766
in less than two hours?!

661
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:10,566
Mr Greene, you are testing
the limits of my patience.

662
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:13,606
Constable, I put it to you

663
00:41:13,766 --> 00:41:17,526
that there was no real
investigation of this matter.

664
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:21,566
There couldn't possibly have been,
in the time frame.

665
00:41:21,726 --> 00:41:23,246
I reject that.

666
00:41:23,406 --> 00:41:25,566
I further put it to you, Constable,

667
00:41:25,726 --> 00:41:29,086
that conscious of the fact that
this assault took place

668
00:41:29,246 --> 00:41:33,566
in the vicinity of a well-known state-run
halfway house,

669
00:41:33,726 --> 00:41:37,126
you merely cross-referenced
your information

670
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:41,766
with the list of current known occupants
of that halfway house

671
00:41:41,926 --> 00:41:46,366
and, bingo, there was Mr Tanner,
two-time loser

672
00:41:46,526 --> 00:41:49,046
with a barbed wire tattoo.

673
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:52,566
Had to be him!
I reject that.

674
00:42:07,006 --> 00:42:09,806
So are you pissed at Vampira
or are you pissed at Fuzz?

675
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:11,526
Both. And I'm also pissed at you.

676
00:42:11,686 --> 00:42:14,846
Why?
You know perfectly well why.

677
00:42:15,006 --> 00:42:18,086
Because we kissed?
I don't want to talk about it.

678
00:42:19,086 --> 00:42:20,446
Did it unsettle you a little?

679
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:23,926
Listen, tonight's gonna
be difficult enough, OK?

680
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:25,406
Can we just...?

681
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:28,246
Oh. Alright, darling.

682
00:42:28,406 --> 00:42:30,846
We'll keep it together.
It's his special birthday.

683
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,526
I know. She can screw him
legally after tonight.

684
00:42:33,686 --> 00:42:35,526
We should've had her charged
when we had the chance.

685
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,486
Who did you want charged?
No-one, Mum.

686
00:42:37,646 --> 00:42:38,646
Vampira?
Mum, please.

687
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,286
It's a disgrace.

688
00:42:40,446 --> 00:42:42,446
We keep it down a little, Prue.

689
00:42:42,606 --> 00:42:46,006
Or what, Cleave?
You'll ask me for a loan?

690
00:42:49,006 --> 00:42:52,366
Did you ever get those pamphlets
I sent you on euthanasia?

691
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:02,126
And so, um,
how's the new school, Fiona?

692
00:43:02,286 --> 00:43:04,446
Vent Fine.

693
00:43:05,526 --> 00:43:06,926
Hmm.

694
00:43:10,686 --> 00:43:13,126
Got some, uh, bright students?

695
00:43:14,166 --> 00:43:15,486
Some.

696
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:19,406
I must say, I think
it's a wonderful thing.

697
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:23,966
In my day, I couldn't have had a
relationship with MY French teacher.

698
00:43:24,126 --> 00:43:26,806
Fiona teaches English, Carm,

699
00:43:26,966 --> 00:43:29,606
and she's no longer
Finnegan's teacher.

700
00:43:29,766 --> 00:43:32,046
You remember we talked
about that earlier?

701
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:34,126
I'm just saying

702
00:43:34,286 --> 00:43:36,566
that Finn is a very lucky boy.

703
00:43:36,726 --> 00:43:38,046
I am, Aunty Carm.

704
00:43:38,206 --> 00:43:40,726
Fiona, you're such
a pretty young thing.

705
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:43,526
Carm...
Oh, here we go. She's off.

706
00:43:43,686 --> 00:43:45,406
I bet there are
some hearts aflutter.

707
00:43:45,566 --> 00:43:47,966
Indeed there are.

708
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,726
How old are you,
if you don't mind my...

709
00:43:49,886 --> 00:43:52,526
Anyone for some more chicken?
You don't look a day over 21.

710
00:43:52,686 --> 00:43:55,326
Got any breasts?
I'm actually 28.

711
00:43:57,246 --> 00:43:58,246
Excuse me.

712
00:43:58,406 --> 00:44:01,046
- Funny — you don't look 28.
- Or act it.

713
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:04,006
I beg your pardon, Mum?
Nothing, darling.

714
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:05,846
Mum, when are you going to get it?

715
00:44:06,006 --> 00:44:08,806
Fiand I are in love.
That's not going to change.

716
00:44:08,966 --> 00:44:11,006
If anything changes,
it's gonna be between you...

717
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:14,446
Fuzz, it's alright. Your mum's
a little stressed. Yeah?

718
00:44:14,606 --> 00:44:17,526
I mean, you both...
have to understand

719
00:44:17,686 --> 00:44:21,406
that this has been a kind of
tricky thing to adjust to.

720
00:44:21,566 --> 00:44:27,246
Um, so let's just try
and start from scratch, shall we?

721
00:44:27,406 --> 00:44:31,926
I'd like to, on this
your 16th birthday,

722
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,606
propose a little toast!

723
00:44:33,766 --> 00:44:37,166
Which will go on till your 17th.

724
00:44:38,206 --> 00:44:41,086
Fuzz, I've never seen you
looking so happy, mate.

725
00:44:41,246 --> 00:44:46,846
And, um...and so I'd like to thank Fiona
for bringing us this joy.

726
00:44:48,126 --> 00:44:49,686
Sorry.

727
00:44:49,846 --> 00:44:51,686
Fi!

728
00:44:51,846 --> 00:44:54,006
Fi, what's wrong?

729
00:44:56,886 --> 00:44:58,646
What happened there?

730
00:45:00,326 --> 00:45:02,126
What happened there?

731
00:45:07,646 --> 00:45:10,326
It will be alright, darling.
I promise.

732
00:45:10,486 --> 00:45:12,126
Your mum's right, mate.

733
00:45:12,286 --> 00:45:16,046
It's gonna hurt like a bastard
for a while, but it'll get better.

734
00:45:16,206 --> 00:45:17,566
No, it won't.

735
00:45:17,726 --> 00:45:21,286
She was the one, Dad.
She's the only one.

736
00:45:21,446 --> 00:45:23,926
Nah, she isn't.

737
00:45:25,086 --> 00:45:26,926
It's better that
she came to her senses now

738
00:45:27,086 --> 00:45:28,606
rather than in a year's time.

739
00:45:28,766 --> 00:45:30,806
What do you mean,
“came to her senses”?

740
00:45:31,966 --> 00:45:33,966
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

741
00:45:34,126 --> 00:45:37,286
You've been undermining this
relationship from the start,

742
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:38,766
the pair of you!

743
00:45:38,926 --> 00:45:41,166
It's no wonder she left me!
Settle down, mate.

744
00:45:41,326 --> 00:45:43,726
Your mum just meant that
it was always gonna be tough.

745
00:45:43,886 --> 00:45:45,206
You know, at some point

746
00:45:45,366 --> 00:45:47,366
she was probably gonna meet
a man her own age.

747
00:45:47,526 --> 00:45:51,646
He's not of her own age, Dad!
He's even younger than I am!

748
00:45:51,806 --> 00:45:55,286
He's at that new school
that you guys fucking drove her to.

749
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:03,366
Fuck!

750
00:46:05,966 --> 00:46:09,086
What's the technical term
for someone like Fiona?

751
00:46:09,246 --> 00:46:10,846
Oh! Nut job.

752
00:46:11,006 --> 00:46:12,366
Yeah, that's it.

753
00:46:12,526 --> 00:46:13,926
We've gotta let
that new school know.

754
00:46:14,086 --> 00:46:15,206
Yeah.

755
00:46:15,366 --> 00:46:18,686
Oh! I'll call them in the morning.

756
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:20,406
No, I'll do it.

757
00:46:20,566 --> 00:46:21,886
Really?

758
00:46:22,046 --> 00:46:26,446
Oh, yes. I must shoulder
some of the load.

759
00:46:47,446 --> 00:46:49,966
Got something on?
Witness.

760
00:46:50,126 --> 00:46:52,086
Ah, yes, that assault.
The Glebe woman.

761
00:46:52,246 --> 00:46:53,726
Yes, the Glebe woman.

762
00:46:53,886 --> 00:46:56,086
I'd say good luck with that, but...
Oh, it'll be fine.

763
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,326
Be interesting to see
what it's like from the other side.

764
00:46:58,486 --> 00:47:00,966
We're good, yeah?

765
00:47:01,126 --> 00:47:02,606
Yeah, we're good.

766
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,406
Excuse me for a moment.

767
00:47:34,046 --> 00:47:36,006
Oil

768
00:47:48,206 --> 00:47:50,086
Miss, open the door.

769
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:51,646
I just need a minute.

770
00:47:51,806 --> 00:47:54,566
Come on, open the door
or I'm gonna bust it down.

771
00:47:57,486 --> 00:47:59,686
He said that
they wouldn't be here.

772
00:47:59,846 --> 00:48:03,766
He promised me they wouldn't
be here! Fucking little shit!

773
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:06,326
What's going on? What is it?

774
00:48:11,006 --> 00:48:14,486
That's my family, Cleave.

775
00:48:14,646 --> 00:48:16,566
That's my mum and my dad.

776
00:48:18,246 --> 00:48:19,966
Those people...

777
00:48:21,126 --> 00:48:23,326
..are your...parents?

778
00:48:26,006 --> 00:48:30,486
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

779
00:48:30,646 --> 00:48:34,526
You are fucking kidding me!

780
00:48:36,606 --> 00:48:38,126
Right.

781
00:48:38,286 --> 00:48:40,886
So Dad wasn't a diplomat.

782
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:46,046
There was no being chased
by bandits in Honduras.

783
00:48:48,606 --> 00:48:51,806
Those people are your parents.

784
00:48:51,966 --> 00:48:54,126
I don't care if I never
see them again.

785
00:48:54,286 --> 00:48:56,366
I don't want to ever see them again.

786
00:48:56,526 --> 00:49:00,726
But Travis is my little brother, Cleave.

787
00:49:00,886 --> 00:49:02,846
I mean, he's had a shit life

788
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:06,166
and it's all gonna be over
if he goes inside again.

789
00:49:06,326 --> 00:49:08,686
Right, so he did it.

790
00:49:11,046 --> 00:49:12,526
Yeah.

791
00:49:13,526 --> 00:49:15,966
You know, if you get
in the witness box

792
00:49:16,126 --> 00:49:18,366
and you lie
and it's found out,

793
00:49:18,526 --> 00:49:23,086
you will not only never practise law
but you'll go to fucking jail.

794
00:49:23,246 --> 00:49:27,446
Now, you might be fine with that,
you might think that's OK, it's cool.

795
00:49:27,606 --> 00:49:30,286
I'm on a professional
fucking tightrope, Missy.

796
00:49:30,446 --> 00:49:31,766
You know my reputation.

797
00:49:31,926 --> 00:49:36,766
If I get the slightest gust of wind,
that's it for me — I'm over, done.

798
00:49:41,766 --> 00:49:45,406
My name is Jane.

799
00:49:46,846 --> 00:49:48,886
It's Jane Tanner.

800
00:49:51,046 --> 00:49:52,686
Is it, Jane?

801
00:49:53,966 --> 00:49:58,326
Well, real... Well, I've got
a couple of questions for you, Jane.

802
00:49:58,486 --> 00:50:02,566
What did I ever do to make you think

803
00:50:02,726 --> 00:50:07,966
that I would give a flying fuck
about where you came from, Jane?

804
00:50:08,126 --> 00:50:10,246
Surely, Christ,
you know me well enough

805
00:50:10,406 --> 00:50:12,246
to know that
that would make no difference.

806
00:50:12,406 --> 00:50:14,846
Or do you really think
that I'm so fucking superficial

807
00:50:15,006 --> 00:50:17,086
I deserve five years of bullshit?

808
00:50:17,246 --> 00:50:20,006
I started the bullshit
long before I met you, Cleave.

809
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:24,486
I can't remember a time in my life
when it hasn't been bullshit.

810
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:32,566
Well, that's some consolation, Jane.

811
00:50:40,046 --> 00:50:41,726
Mr Greene?

812
00:50:41,886 --> 00:50:44,446
Mr Greene?

813
00:51:05,686 --> 00:51:08,046
Do you recall the precise time

814
00:51:08,206 --> 00:51:11,526
of your collision with Mr Tanner,
Miss Partridge?

815
00:51:14,766 --> 00:51:16,606
Yes.

816
00:51:16,766 --> 00:51:20,526
It was a little after 8:00.
I'd just finished a lecture.

817
00:51:23,166 --> 00:51:25,246
I see.

818
00:51:25,406 --> 00:51:31,286
And are you absolutely convinced that it
was the defendant, Travis Tanner?

819
00:51:33,406 --> 00:51:35,486
Yes, I'm sure.

820
00:51:40,486 --> 00:51:42,126
Thank you.

821
00:51:42,286 --> 00:51:44,166
No further questions, Your Honour.

822
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:49,526
Really?
Yeah.

823
00:51:49,686 --> 00:51:51,566
What is this incident?
The chemist's shop?

824
00:51:51,726 --> 00:51:54,846
Oh, well, you want the whole story
or the abridged?

825
00:51:55,006 --> 00:51:56,886
I'll give you the whole story.
No, the whole story.

826
00:51:57,046 --> 00:51:59,046
It's a good story.
Mr Greene.

827
00:52:00,046 --> 00:52:01,206
Thank you.

828
00:52:01,366 --> 00:52:04,646
Whatever for, Miss Partridge?

829
00:52:04,806 --> 00:52:06,526
A drink's in order,
don't you think, Simone?

830
00:52:06,686 --> 00:52:08,566
Yes, I do. So where do we start?

831
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:11,606
Oh, well, the chemist's shop
or the drink?

832
