1
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,354
Who is this?

2
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,942
Who is this? Are you gonna answer me?

3
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:27,319
Who the fuck is this? Fuck.

4
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,572
What the fuck?

5
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,249
Rusty, who was that?

6
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:50,676
Saw you where?

7
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:05,190
I'm assuming that they mean
Carolyn's house...

8
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,902
the night of...

9
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,418
I wasn't there to kill her.

10
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,433
God.

11
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,922
Rusty, this is not you.

12
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,342
- Rusty, this is not you.
- You don't fucking know me.

13
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,635
You don't know me.

14
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,928
And you don't know what's in me!

15
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,391
Wake up, Raymond!

16
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:50,838
<i>You think he's guilty.</i>

17
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:54,591
- It was a dream, Lo.
- Okay.

18
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,678
You dreamt he's guilty,
which can mean something.

19
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,223
Dreams often point to the truth.

20
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,476
Hey. You know,
you being on my side would be nice.

21
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:08,272
- Maybe we can try that?
- You think I am not on your side?

22
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,316
Raymond, I am worried about you.

23
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,528
The glare that comes
with this kind of case, the pressure.

24
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,783
Listen, I understand
your thirst for relevance,

25
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:25,163
your need to get out of bed in the morning
and have something to do to stave off--

26
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,916
- What is it you call it?
- My decomposing rot.

27
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,210
Yes, your decomposing rot.

28
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,804
With your best friend as the defendant.

29
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,391
Honey...

30
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:50,480
should you lose,
a good chance from what I see and read,

31
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,193
Rusty spends the rest of his natural life
in prison,

32
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,361
which you will very much take to heart.

33
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,782
Maybe you can live with it just fine,

34
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,743
but I doubt it.

35
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,247
Then, there's the alternative.

36
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,627
You win.

37
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,923
Rusty didn't do this.

38
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:23,680
{\an8}<i>Rusty Sabich, the only suspect
in the grisly murder of Carolyn Polhemus,</i>

39
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,183
<i>is currently out on bail</i>

40
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,852
<i>and isolating with his family
in their home.</i>

41
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,482
There's human trash outside.

42
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:36,944
- Don't they have actual news to report?
- We are actual news.

43
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,780
People love true crime.
It's a ratings thing.

44
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,249
- Thank you.
- Here you go, sweetie.

45
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,643
<i>So you have no idea who sent it?</i>

46
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,479
It could very easily be a trick,
or it could be some...

47
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,066
semi-clever reporter.

48
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:21,029
So this individual knew
that you were there the night of?

49
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,243
'Cause I didn't.

50
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,582
I went there after work.

51
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,711
So the two of you weren't quite as over
as you led me and others to believe.

52
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:39,673
No-- We were over.
I went over there to try and change that.

53
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,757
And did you?

54
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,426
No.

55
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,805
Lorraine, hi--

56
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,768
I think you should just hand it over
to the police.

57
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,770
Hold on. Don't you wanna know
what this is about?

58
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,273
Who?

59
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,359
It could also just blow up in our face.

60
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,282
- What about Rigo? Can't she take it?
- No, no, no.

61
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,035
I've asked her to do too much already.
I can't ask her.

62
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,578
If you do this,

63
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,372
you have to assume that
the person you're meeting

64
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,957
is gonna be wearing a wire.

65
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,670
So whatever you say,
I strongly suggest that you--

66
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,926
You keep it simple, clean.
Watch your words.

67
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,679
Definitely don't say that you hit Carolyn
on the head with a poker.

68
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,724
I'm gonna take on an associate,

69
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,893
someone who's done defense before.

70
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,437
She's young. Her name is Mya Winslow.

71
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,147
- How do I know her?
- Yale.

72
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,149
She's good. She was at Sandy Stern's.

73
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,486
More importantly, she's a woman,
which we need on this.

74
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:47,199
She's gonna run point on forensics,
so we also need to assemble that.

75
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,662
Listen, let's talk strategy
for a minute, okay?

76
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,083
If we're gonna go alibi on this,
we need to file on that. Give notice.

77
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,794
So, you think we might go alibi?

78
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,007
Okay.

79
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,427
And I mean, we don't know
what time of the night she was murdered.

80
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,972
I mean, maybe we could say
that she was killed when I went to the--

81
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,098
Stop.

82
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,186
Let's just wait
for all the facts to come in...

83
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,107
before you start crafting responses.

84
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:42,254
Mrs. Sabich. Barbara,
did your husband commit this murder?

85
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:45,215
Do you hate Carolyn Polhemus
for sleeping with your husband?

86
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:48,677
Mrs. Sabich. Mrs. Sabich,
we wanna know how you're fee--

87
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,393
- <i>You know what this is, right?</i>
- <i>What?</i>

88
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,771
Why I'm here on a Tuesday?

89
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:03,150
Yeah, we're talking about...

90
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,029
the fire marshal for Marty's thing, right?

91
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,656
I need you to take a step back.

92
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,829
What does that mean?

93
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,166
I came in through the same door you did.

94
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,420
Kate. It'll blow over.

95
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,007
We live in Chicago. There's, like,
a new dead body every 18 seconds.

96
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,592
You haven't been well.

97
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,514
I sold a piece two weeks ago, Kate.

98
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:36,058
No. You sold a piece five weeks ago,

99
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,977
and Aminata's pieces sell themselves.

100
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,315
- Take some time.
- Are you really doing this?

101
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:45,108
I'm not firing you, so don't get heavy.

102
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,193
I'm saying...

103
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,029
take a break...

104
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,407
and take care of yourself.

105
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,204
- And keep my distance, huh?
- Yeah. And that, yeah.

106
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,962
Kate, I really need this job.

107
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:09,132
I need every distraction
I can get right now.

108
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,594
It's a distraction
that doesn't work for us.

109
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,014
Take some time.

110
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,727
Word of advice?

111
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,523
- Why not.
- Differentiate.

112
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,360
You're not "we." You're not "him."

113
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,581
Sam Malone used to cut lemons.

114
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,457
What was that?

115
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,835
Sam Malone from <i>Cheers.</i>

116
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,716
Cut lemons all the time.
Always cutting lemons.

117
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,178
You're probably too young
to remember <i>Cheers</i>.

118
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,346
I know <i>Cheers</i>. I love Cheers. Ted Danson.

119
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,265
Why do you think I'm cutting these lemons?

120
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,516
Gold star.

121
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:07,191
- You okay?
- Not really. I just lost my job.

122
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,526
Shit. Sorry to hear that.

123
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,240
And my husband's on trial for murder.

124
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,369
Murdering his mistress, no less.

125
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,539
Oh, shit. Yeah.

126
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,375
What's his fucking name-- Ronnie? Ricky?

127
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,675
Rusty. Wow.
Yeah, you're going through a lot.

128
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,470
Yes, I am.

129
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,142
Did he? Kill his mistress?

130
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,312
Jesus.
You don't have to answer that. I'm--

131
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:48,398
- That was out of line. Sorry.
- Not really.

132
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,859
It's the question everyone's asking.

133
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,237
What's your answer?

134
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,366
He did not do it.

135
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,789
Beautiful women
tend to have a lot of enemies.

136
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,417
You must have a few yourself.

137
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,631
- I see what you did there.
- Yeah.

138
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,304
Thank you.

139
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,226
Would you like another?

140
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:28,647
I better not.

141
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:30,482
Okay.

142
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,327
He's cute.

143
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,957
He is handsome, yes.

144
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,795
But, I don't know, I like talking to him.

145
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,924
He made you smile.

146
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,556
Maybe you should have a little adventure.

147
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,434
Please.

148
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,478
And with the media
following my every move?

149
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,730
They're stalking me.

150
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,274
Oh, honey, they've already moved on.

151
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,610
They've got their footage,
and they're on to the next dead thing.

152
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,778
It's a perk of living in Chicago.

153
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,280
I don't know.

154
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,282
It's good to see you smile.

155
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:25,454
You're young, you're beautiful.
You should feel that way every day.

156
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,749
You are under so much pressure.

157
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:34,087
Are you seriously suggesting
I engage in a little...

158
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,718
extramarital revenge sex
with a bartender I just met?

159
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:43,680
I am suggesting that you tend to yourself.

160
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:48,018
An escape hatch of some sort
to help you get to the other side of this.

161
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,772
I mean, not now.
I get it, with everything going on.

162
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,357
But at some point.

163
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,443
I admire your fight,

164
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:02,616
your commitment to be in love,
to stay in love with the man you married.

165
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,372
Rusty isn't the man you married.

166
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,040
Let's face that.

167
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,341
I directly told you
to stand down, Detective.

168
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:20,676
- And I have.
- Bullshit.

169
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,636
You and Rusty went to visit
Liam Reynolds in prison.

170
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,888
That was on my own personal time.

171
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,348
You think this is funny?

172
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,767
Why would I waste funny
on somebody with no sense of humor?

173
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,894
- You know what is funny?
- What?

174
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,187
Fucking hilarious, actually,

175
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,731
is that you're not looking
at Reynolds for this.

176
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,568
Carolyn was tied up like Bunny Davis,
details not in the public domain--

177
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,236
Liam Reynolds is incarcerated.

178
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,780
So the fuck what? He threatened her.
He had a motive,

179
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,323
and you won't give it
so much as a look-see.

180
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:45,576
- Listen, Detective--
- Or, what? You'll fire me?

181
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,327
Two weeks into your new job? I think not.

182
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,246
Have the whole union up your ass.

183
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,748
Or maybe not.
I keep forgetting that you're popular.

184
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,459
Detective Rodriguez, I'll walk you out.

185
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,259
If I may, you are off this case.

186
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,344
You will not impede it,
you will not obstruct it.

187
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,347
And I play poker with your union boss,
by the way.

188
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,891
Terrible fucking poker player.

189
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,268
You guys just want it to be Rusty so bad,
don't you?

190
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:14,271
Our only pursuit is justice.

191
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,566
Just be sure you do not
stand in that path.

192
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,861
Thank you.

193
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,516
Hey. Can you do me a favor?

194
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:53,560
I need you to go down to the ME's office,

195
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,687
pull all the files
on the Bunny Davis case.

196
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:57,898
Yeah.

197
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,546
Michael?

198
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,178
Michael, you asked me to come here.
What do you want?

199
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:55,641
Why did you kill her?

200
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,187
I didn't kill her.

201
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:02,981
I had a relationship with her,

202
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:06,318
and I will tell you anything
that you wanna know about that.

203
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:11,323
Michael, I wanna find out who killed her
just as much as you do.

204
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:14,034
Yeah, well, that's funny.
'Cause I have pictures of you.

205
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:16,994
You have what?

206
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:22,291
I have pictures and videos of you
on the night she died.

207
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,170
- Where?
- Her house!

208
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,048
Michael,
you have photographs of her that night?

209
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,926
Answer me.

210
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,970
You have photographs of that night?

211
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:36,431
You have photographs of other people
going in and out of her house?

212
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,935
You were literally the only one there.

213
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:46,316
Well, I guess,
seems like you were there that night too.

214
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,568
Shut up!

215
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:49,444
Did you think this through?

216
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,322
Were you there other nights?

217
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,492
If you have photographs,

218
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:58,996
you need to make sure
that you give them to me,

219
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,956
or you give them to the police.

220
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:04,293
I already gave them to the police.
I met with the district attorney.

221
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,588
Then why are we here, Michael?

222
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:11,717
I wanted to see your face.

223
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:16,847
See your face? Why? I don't buy it.

224
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:20,267
I don't know.
It was a very strange conversation,

225
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,811
and the kid is very clearly troubled
like you said, but--

226
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:26,940
but look, at least we now have evidence
that I wasn't the only one there.

227
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,444
- Are you sure he wasn't wired?
- If he was, I was careful.

228
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,237
Mya Winslow, Rusty Sabich.

229
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,155
Hi.

230
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,824
I asked Mya to join us
for the status conference.

231
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,160
- We gotta get your appearance filed.
- Already done.

232
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,495
- Excellent.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

233
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,831
Though not under these circumstances.

234
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,791
You can just observe on this one,
nothing to say.

235
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,503
You, keep your mouth shut. Not a peep.

236
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,755
This is my show. Don't fuck it up.

237
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:55,761
<i>You're fucking it all up.</i>

238
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:59,973
- You're fucking it all up.
- Why?

239
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,479
That falling-in-love part.

240
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,023
That we promised not to.

241
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,819
I don't think that you can control that.

242
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:15,280
Some things you can control.

243
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,245
And I have to be the one to--
to control it.

244
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,167
Tab one. Evidentiary exhibits.

245
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:31,839
Path and lab reports
you'll find behind that in tab two.

246
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,217
That section is still incomplete
but is being updated daily.

247
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:38,095
- To be completed when?
- We're hoping ten days, Your Honor.

248
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,640
Photography and video exhibits
follow in tab three,

249
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,850
also to be completed forthwith.

250
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,853
We're still gathering,
including street and city cams.

251
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,772
Medical findings in tab four,

252
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,359
and scientific exhibits and analysis

253
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,486
behind it in tabs five and six.
What's the problem?

254
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,196
Just hold on a second.

255
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,031
- You've got me down as a witness.
- We do.

256
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,951
One of the charges
is obstruction of justice, Raymond,

257
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:03,620
and Mr. Sabich impeded this investigation.

258
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,832
In fact, he compromised it,
and you have information about that.

259
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:09,626
- This is a stunt.
- No. Sorry. Just very quickly,

260
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,211
you took this post as counsel

261
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,173
while in possession of information
that's material to the charges.

262
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:16,383
- You should've known better.
- Mr. Delay Guardia.

263
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:20,012
You've also got down Dr. Rush,
my client's psychiatrist.

264
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,805
We anticipate that
some of the subject matter

265
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,223
might qualify as privileged,

266
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,934
and Dr. Rush would be free to claim
that exemption should it apply.

267
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,811
- It will be.
- What do you mean, "should it apply"?

268
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,855
You're gonna ask her to come in,
she's gonna assert privilege,

269
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,565
and then he's gonna paint it
like we're hiding information.

270
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,775
- We will honor privileged information.
- Withholding evidence.

271
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:37,446
Gentlemen, we're not getting off
on a good bunion here.

272
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:40,240
We have a case to present. I would submit
Your Honor will let us do so.

273
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:45,454
When I took this job years ago,
I had a mentor.

274
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:49,833
He told me,
"Every trial is a bit like a hemorrhoid."

275
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,586
Hemorrhoids don't typically bother me.

276
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,547
I can even enjoy them
when properly managed.

277
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,760
I'm not enjoying myself now.

278
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:03,847
This trial will be about evidence and law.

279
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:07,601
What it won't be about is gamesmanship.
Do I make myself perfectly clear?

280
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,394
- Clear.
- Well said. Thank you.

281
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,357
May I also remind the court

282
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:17,152
that the prosecution has a duty
to turn over all exculpatory evidence.

283
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,404
- We've done so.
- You have?

284
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,448
We've turned over all exculpatory evidence

285
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,075
per our duty as officers of the court.

286
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,159
So if you had evidence, say,

287
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,662
that someone else might have motive
to commit this crime...

288
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:27,746
There's no such evidence.

289
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:31,208
...or you may have evidence, say,
that someone else was there that night,

290
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:38,882
maybe someone with a camera
taking pictures and videos.

291
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:44,513
Mr. Molto?

292
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:46,974
- Yeah. I got it.
- Is that--

293
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:48,642
We just received photographic evidence

294
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:51,019
that we're still in the process
of authenticating.

295
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,021
Once that authentication process
is complete,

296
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,231
we will share it with counsel.

297
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:57,609
Who proffered this photographic evidence?

298
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:00,279
The victim's son.

299
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,448
May I ask when it was proffered?

300
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:04,992
We are in the process of analyzing it.

301
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:07,494
- And any disclosure would be premature.
- I see. Hey.

302
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:10,706
You are gonna turn over
that evidence today,

303
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:12,249
to defense counsel and to me,

304
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,419
so we can all
properly analyze it together. Sound good?

305
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:19,006
And, Mr. Molto,

306
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,674
we are ten weeks from trial.

307
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:24,678
If you choose to hide anything else
from either defense counsel or this court,

308
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:26,597
I suggest that you not
stick it up your ass

309
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:28,974
'cause that's the first place
I'm gonna come looking.

310
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:32,102
Raymond was in his element.
You know, he was on fire.

311
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:35,439
And Tommy was in his element.

312
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,523
Bet he was.

313
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,943
The judge granted our motion
to access the scene,

314
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:43,071
and that's not something
that the defense usually gets.

315
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,365
- So a good day then?
- It's a good start.

316
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,202
That's good. Maybe we'll win,

317
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:51,038
and it'll be so great
that reporters will say,

318
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,499
"Rusty Sabich, you just won
the Super Bowl of murder trials.

319
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,126
What are you gonna do now?"

320
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:59,171
And you'll say,
"We're going to Disneyland."

321
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:08,972
I would like to know
what evidence they have against you.

322
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,766
Jaden, not at the table.

323
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:13,143
- Yes, Mom. It's everywhere.
- Not at dinner.

324
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,354
- It's on the news, at school.
- Not at--

325
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:17,648
I just wanna know what is what.

326
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:20,442
What exactly do they have?

327
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:25,447
Thank you.

328
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,289
It's circumstantial.

329
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,000
Nobody's gonna be called to the stand
to say they saw me kill her

330
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,127
because I did not kill her.

331
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:43,257
But I was there that night,
and my DNA is all over her apartment,

332
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,676
and her DNA is all over my car.

333
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:49,930
And they're gonna say
that I was obsessed with her

334
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,517
because there are many, many,
many texts between me and her.

335
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:57,354
Mostly from me in those last few weeks.

336
00:23:57,354 --> 00:24:00,190
And obviously, there's the evidence
that she was pregnant with...

337
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:08,115
And the fact that she was tied up like a--
a prior victim.

338
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:12,369
The killer must have had information
that wasn't available to the public.

339
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:16,790
Carolyn and I were the only two
most privy to that information,

340
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,042
so they're gonna make the argument

341
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:24,339
that I was in a unique position
to make it look like somebody else did it.

342
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,220
It's circumstantial,
and in a lot of ways it's a stretch,

343
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,306
but it's damaging.

344
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:34,224
And all the evidence,
no matter how circumstantial,

345
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,309
points to me.

346
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:43,650
And a plea?

347
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:48,488
- I mean, have you thought about that?
- A what?

348
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,199
- A plea.
- Kyle.

349
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,367
A guilty plea? Why--
What, do you think I did this, Kyle?

350
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,327
Honey.

351
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,704
I'm just saying,
if they offered manslaughter--

352
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:58,624
Why would I take a plea
for something that I did not do?

353
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,791
Rusty.

354
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:03,212
To avoid a life sentence.
Manslaughter's eight years.

355
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:04,546
Oh, honey.

356
00:25:57,391 --> 00:26:00,435
- He thinks that I did it.
- Rusty, he does not think you did it.

357
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,312
Then why would he ask me
to plead guilty for something

358
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:04,314
- he thinks that I didn't do?
- Because he's scared.

359
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,149
The kid is terrified.

360
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:10,195
That they could put you away forever.

361
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,911
Do you think that I should?

362
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:21,999
Does Jaden?

363
00:26:24,376 --> 00:26:26,378
Do you think that I should
accept a plea bargain?

364
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:29,756
Rusty, no one in this family thinks
you should accept a plea bargain.

365
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,093
Kyle was just--

366
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,847
Honey, he was just thinking aloud.

367
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:42,394
He was thinking that I should
plead guilty for murder.

368
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:54,907
Honey, everyone is scared.

369
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:05,792
Kate asked me to "step back"
from the gallery.

370
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,960
What? Why?

371
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:10,005
Bad for business, I guess.

372
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,091
- I'm sorry.
- Dad?

373
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,268
Hey.

374
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,979
I didn't mean to say
that I thought you did it.

375
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,689
I'm sorry, I just...

376
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:33,153
The way you made it sound
with the evidence and the--

377
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,238
I understand.

378
00:27:35,656 --> 00:27:36,657
I'm sorry.

379
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,243
Please don't go. Please don't--

380
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:41,370
I'm sorry.

381
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,353
I think we should drop
the obstruction charge.

382
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:07,312
Why?

383
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:13,235
We can make Rusty out to be a bad actor,
but our burden is on homicide, all right?

384
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:15,195
It's a bigger hill to climb.

385
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:18,031
The jury are gonna want to get him, sure,

386
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:20,158
but the obstruction charge
allows them to do that

387
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:22,619
without finding him guilty of murder.

388
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,454
I just think
we just put one thing on the menu.

389
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,123
Right, but the abusive process charge

390
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:27,958
speaks to his attempts
to impede the investigation,

391
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:29,459
- which goes to his guilt.
- Think about it.

392
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,879
That's all I'm gonna say. Right?

393
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:37,634
Are you up to this?
Trying this particular case?

394
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,970
Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah, I am.

395
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,515
See? It's that.
That response right there makes me nervous

396
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,979
because it speaks to a certain zeal
that Raymond is gonna exploit.

397
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:52,983
Tommy, listen to me.

398
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,698
The words that shall attach
to this prosecution are "methodical,

399
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:01,241
exhaustive, and fair."

400
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:06,038
Words that shall not be associated
are "vindictive, maniacal, and vicious."

401
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:09,833
I understand, Nico.
Just don't talk to me like I'm a monkey.

402
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:16,173
Do you remember the first thing you said
when I made you chief deputy prosecutor?

403
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:18,383
I believe I expressed my gratitude.

404
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:23,055
No. The first thing you said was,
"The girls are sure gonna like me now."

405
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,182
Turned out to be true.

406
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:28,101
I mean, there's just a part of you,
may-maybe it's your essence,

407
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:31,021
which just needs this validation, this--

408
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,398
You know, to impress somebody.

409
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:37,069
And I know smart people
with a persecution complex,

410
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:41,532
and some with a narcissistic complex.

411
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:44,451
Somehow you have both. It's like a duplex.

412
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,996
Sounds expensive to fix.

413
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:52,960
- You hate Rusty. That's clear.
- No.

414
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,382
No, I don't hate Rusty.
I-- This is incredibly difficult for me.

415
00:29:58,382 --> 00:29:59,550
This is not difficult.

416
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:03,720
It's because all the slights
and the digs and the nicks

417
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,431
and the cuts, it eats at you.

418
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,101
You want another drink?

419
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:10,686
Okay.

420
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:12,437
We need some hard evidence for murder.

421
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:15,649
That's coming.

422
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:24,825
So the site visit at Carolyn's
is later today.

423
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:27,244
You feel up to that?

424
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:29,079
Yes. I will be there.

425
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:29,997
Good.

426
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,541
- This fucking indictment.
- What are you doing?

427
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:35,002
"Trespass with force and arms."
It's just-- It's--

428
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,171
I mean,
I've dictated this a million times,

429
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,422
but to read it about me is...

430
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:43,010
So I've called our friend Mr. Molto twice,

431
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,803
and I've left messages for him.

432
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:47,097
Well, if he doesn't call you back,
he's gonna be in contempt.

433
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:50,100
I left the car open. I'll be right back.

434
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:16,793
Did you love her?

435
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:21,006
- Did I what?
- Carolyn.

436
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:23,050
Did you love her?

437
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:31,016
I'm actually not really sure
why that's relevant.

438
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:35,187
Raymond has tasked me with
building your narrative for trial

439
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:37,648
- in case you should have to testify.
- Uh-huh.

440
00:31:37,648 --> 00:31:39,608
So he wants me to testify?

441
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:40,692
Well, just in case.

442
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:53,205
Well, was it about lust?

443
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:56,917
Love? Both?

444
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:58,502
Okay...

445
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,131
both.

446
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:12,099
Do you remember when you first felt
an emotional attachment?

447
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:14,810
Not when you first
wanted to have sex, but--

448
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,103
- Yeah. No, I understand.
- Okay.

449
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:18,647
Yeah.

450
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:23,277
We had a...

451
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:30,784
We had a case. Sexual assault.

452
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:33,579
The victim was a little girl.

453
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:35,247
These are twins. This is...

454
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:38,876
<i>We're not trained in kindness
as prosecutors.</i>

455
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,961
- <i>It's not a prerequisite.</i>
- Can you tell me...

456
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:43,172
<i>In fact,
sometimes I think it's trained out of us,</i>

457
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:45,549
but not Carolyn.

458
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:46,633
<i>I don't know.</i>

459
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:47,718
<i>And that day,</i>

460
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:52,598
there was something about the tenderness
that she showed that fragile little girl.

461
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:56,685
- This is Dell.
- Dell.

462
00:32:56,685 --> 00:33:00,606
- This is Perla.
- That's a lot of people.

463
00:33:00,606 --> 00:33:02,774
- Yeah.
- Are they friends?

464
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:04,568
- They're family.
- They're family?

465
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:11,158
So it might get a little scary in there,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

466
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:16,997
But I'm gonna be with you the whole time.

467
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:23,253
And then if you get too scared,
then you can raise your hand like this.

468
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,342
Good.

469
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:30,761
And I can come over,
and I can hold your hand.

470
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,763
We can stop whenever you want.

471
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:34,515
I can hold you,

472
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:38,560
and I can ask the judge
if we can go for a walk.

473
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:41,772
And I'll make sure
that you're always safe.

474
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,693
Do you think you can trust me with that?
To keep you safe?

475
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:48,529
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

476
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,239
You're doing so good.

477
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:53,700
<i>That was it.</i>

478
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,286
I guess that was the moment.

479
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:03,001
When you crossed over the great
I'm-gonna-fuck-up-my-life-forever divide.

480
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,754
Love isn't what people tell you
that it is, Mya.

481
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:07,464
I'm sure that I don't
have to tell you that.

482
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:08,799
But in my experience,

483
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:11,552
it's just something that grows
until one day...

484
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,097
you just find yourself needing someone.

485
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:18,433
That's how it was with Carolyn.

486
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:22,103
So, yeah.

487
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,190
Fucked up my life forever...

488
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:28,902
but I did not cross the other divide.

489
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:32,364
I would never have hurt her.

490
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:35,659
Somebody else did that,

491
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:40,246
and whoever that person is
is having a good fucking laugh

492
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:42,416
while everyone comes after me.

493
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,214
Full count, 3-2.

494
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,141
Strike three!

495
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:00,350
He's out!

496
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:35,469
This is beautiful.

497
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:40,516
You're desperate.

498
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:27,646
So we just got the big dump
from Delay's office.

499
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,439
Expect them to start burying us...

500
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,566
Do you want another one?

501
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:32,317
<i>...with discovery tonnage:
documents, evidence, whatever,</i>

502
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:33,652
so we gotta keep pace.

503
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:36,029
Did they turn over the labs?

504
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:38,407
Not yet.

505
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:43,287
Well, it might be in this latest dump.
You never know.

506
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:46,039
The forensics team is standing by.

507
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:49,751
It's a little needle in the haystack
at this point, you know?

508
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:52,713
But who knows?
We may find something they didn't.

509
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:55,007
My DNA must be all over this place.

510
00:36:57,843 --> 00:36:59,887
Rusty, we stipulated that you were here.

511
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:04,433
The two of you were having an affair.
It does not mean that you killed her.

512
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:09,229
Unless they find her blood in your car,
which they won't, right?

513
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:17,237
I know.

514
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:19,740
I keep seeing it too.

515
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:27,748
Listen. Talk to me for a second.

516
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:34,254
Rigo tells me
that you're trying to run down

517
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:38,050
the contaminated semen specimen
in the Bunny Davis case.

518
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,009
Yeah.

519
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:43,180
- If we offer the idea of another suspect...
- Ray.

520
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:46,058
...we can pretty much assume
the obligation to deliver one.

521
00:37:46,058 --> 00:37:47,935
- And if we fail--
- Ray.

522
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:51,021
The prosecution is gonna show
the most brutal photographs of Carolyn

523
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:53,357
on that night. It's gonna be horrific.

524
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:55,108
And then the jury's
gonna want someone to blame,

525
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:57,819
and if we don't have an alternative,
it's gonna be me.

526
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:01,240
- Let it go.
- No.

527
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:04,451
<i>Evidence number 13, voicemail number four,</i>

528
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:06,453
<i>victim's message on defendant's phone.</i>

529
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:09,206
<i>What do you want, Rusty, out of this?</i>

530
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:10,916
<i>I don't have much else to give.</i>

531
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:13,418
<i>I understand wanting distance for a while</i>

532
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:16,004
<i>but that's partly
what has been so difficult for me.</i>

533
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:17,548
<i>I would be open</i>

534
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:20,300
<i>to having another conversation
if you think that it will be helpful.</i>

535
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,135
<i>No, I hate pretending
that you're not there.</i>

536
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:24,304
<i>I don't understand
why you're just not picking up.</i>

537
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:27,099
<i>I don't think you understand
my perspective on things.</i>

538
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:29,852
<i>I need you to stop calling me
like this, Rusty. This isn't fair.</i>

539
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,937
<i>I've never disagreed with anything more.</i>

540
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:33,355
<i>All the evidence I have
tells me you love me.</i>

541
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:34,857
We'll present to you physical, scientific,

542
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:37,067
forensic evidence that will lead you
to make your own con--

543
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:39,152
That will lead you to form
your own conclusions.

544
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:40,362
Think!

545
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:42,531
Facts!

546
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:03,427
Fuck.

547
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:06,763
All right.
