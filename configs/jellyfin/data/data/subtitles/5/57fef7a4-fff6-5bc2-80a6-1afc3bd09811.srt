1
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,675
Let me tell you
what "like a virgin" is about.

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:11,845
It's all about a girl
who digs a guy with a big dick.

3
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,181
The entire song,
it's a metaphor for big dicks.

4
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:18,644
No, it ain't. It's about a girl
who's very vulnerable.

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,521
She's been fucked over a few times

6
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,290
and then she meets a guy
who's very sensitive.

7
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,982
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Time out, green bay.

8
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,746
Tell that fucking bullshit
to the tourists.

9
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,903
Toby? Who the fuck is Toby?

10
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,280
"Like a virgin" is not
about some sensitive girl

11
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:31,949
who meets a nice fella.

12
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,178
That's what "true blue" is about.
Granted, no argument about that.

13
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,495
Which one is "true blue"?

14
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,224
You ain't heard "true blue"?
It was a big-ass hit from Madonna.

15
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,208
I don't even follow
that tops of the pop shit

16
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,793
and even I've heard of "true blue."

17
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,712
Asshole, I didn't say I ain't heard of it.
What I asked is how's it go.

18
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,090
Excuse me for not being
the world's biggest Madonna fan.

19
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,893
Personally, I can do without her.

20
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,719
I used to like her early stuff,
"borderline."

21
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,764
But when she got off with that
"papa don't preach" phase, I tuned out.

22
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,642
You guys are making me
lose my train of thought here.

23
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,811
I was saying something. What was it?

24
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,273
Oh, Toby's that little Chinese girl.

25
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,858
- What was her last name?
- What's that?

26
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:11,530
It's an old address book I found in a coat
I haven't worn in a coon's age.

27
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,990
What was that name?

28
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,741
What the fuck was I talking about?

29
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,578
You said "true blue" was about a guy, uh—-

30
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,454
a sensitive girl who meets a nice guy,

31
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,498
but "like a virgin"
was a metaphor for big dicks.

32
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,334
Okay. Let me tell you
what "like a virgin" is about.

33
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,379
It's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.

34
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,881
I'm talking morning,
day, night, afternoon.

35
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,718
Dick, dick, dick, dick, click,
click, dick, dick, dick.

36
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,886
- How many dicks is that?
- A lot.

37
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,598
Then one day, she meets
this John Holmes motherfucker,

38
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,474
and it's like, whoa, baby.

39
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,019
This cat is like Charles Bronson
in the great escape.

40
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,520
He's digging tunnels.

41
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,647
She's getting serious dick action

42
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,233
and she's feeling something
she ain't felt since forever.

43
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,152
Pain. Pain.

44
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,903
Chu? Toby chu?

45
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:55,032
It hurts. It hurts her.
It shouldn't hurt her.

46
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,494
Her pussy should be bubble yum by now,
but when this cat fucks her, it hurts.

47
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,664
It hurts just like it did the first time.

48
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,375
You see, the pain
is reminding a fuck machine

49
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,586
what it was once like to be a virgin.

50
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,505
Hence, "like a virgin."

51
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,133
Wong.

52
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,052
Give me that fucking thing.

53
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,363
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Give me my book back.

54
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,557
I'm sick of fucking hearing it, Joe.
I'll give it back to you when we leave.

55
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,143
What do you mean when we leave?
Give me it back now.

56
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:27,189
For the past 15 minutes now,
you've been droning on about names.

57
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,565
"Toby_.

58
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:31,151
Toby? Toby?

59
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,444
Toby wong.

60
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,655
Toby wong? Toby wong.

61
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,115
Toby chung? Fucking Charlie chan."

62
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,285
I've got Madonna's big dick
coming out of my left ear

63
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:44,247
and Toby the jap i-don't-know-what
coming out of my right.

64
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,749
Give me that book.

65
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,710
Are you gonna put it away?

66
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,213
I'm gonna do whatever the fuck
I want with it.

67
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,966
Well, then I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to keep it.

68
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,803
Hey, Joe, want me to shoot this guy?

69
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,970
Shit.

70
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:03,141
You shoot me in a dream,
you better wake up and apologize.

71
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,271
Have you guys been listening

72
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,524
to k-Billy's super sounds
of the '70s weekend?

73
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,067
Oh, yeah, man. That's fucking great.

74
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,544
Can you believe the songs
they've been playing?

75
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,238
You know what I heard the other day?
"Heartbeat, it's a love beat"

76
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,201
by little Tony defranco
and the defranco family.

77
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,760
I haven't heard that song
since I was in the fifth fuckin' grade.

78
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,285
When I was coming down here,

79
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,413
"the night the lights
went out in Georgia" came on.

80
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:27,332
I... I ain't heard that song
since it was big.

81
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,544
When it was big, I must have heard it
a million trillion fucking times.

82
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,504
This is the first time I ever realized

83
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,507
that the girl singing the song
is the one who shot Andy.

84
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,277
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
was the one who shot Andy?

85
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,220
I thought it was the cheating wife
shot Andy.

86
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,407
Yeah, but they say that
at the end of the song.

87
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,726
I know, motherfucker. I just heard it.
That's what I'm talking about.

88
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,188
I must have zoned out
during that part before.

89
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:53,900
All right. I'll take care of the check.

90
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,610
You guys can get the tip.

91
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,155
Should be about a buck apiece.

92
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,200
And you, when I come back, I want my book.

93
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,910
Sorry. It's my book now.

94
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,455
Hey, I changed my mind.

95
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,790
Shoot this piece of shit, will you?

96
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,881
All right. Everybody cough up
some green for the little lady.

97
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,930
Come on. Throw in a buck.

98
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,724
Uh-uh. I don't tip.

99
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,058
You don't tip?

100
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,435
No, I don't believe in it.

101
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,729
You don't believe in tipping.

102
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,982
You know what these chicks make?
They make shit.

103
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,777
Don't give me that. She don't
make enough money, she can quit.

104
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,588
I don't even know a fucking Jew
who'd have the balls to say that.

105
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,408
Let me just get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?

106
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,036
I don't tip because
society says I have to.

107
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,121
I mean, I'll tip if somebody
really deserves a tip.

108
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,683
If they really put forth the effort,
I'll give them something extra.

109
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,335
But this tipping automatically,
uh, it's for the birds.

110
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,088
As far as I'm concerned,
they're just doing their job.

111
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,066
- Hey, this girl was nice.
- She was okay.

112
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,450
- —She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?

113
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,095
Take you in the back and suck your dick?

114
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,975
I'd go over 12% for that.

115
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,852
Hey, look. I ordered coffee, right?

116
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,748
We've been here a long fucking time.
She's only filled my cup three times.

117
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,690
When I order coffee,
I want it filled six times.

118
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,944
Six times?
Well, what if she's too fucking busy?

119
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,113
Words "too fucking busy"
shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.

120
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,406
Excuse me, Mr. Pink,

121
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,368
but the last fucking thing you need
is another cup of coffee.

122
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,079
Jesus Christ, these ladies
aren't starving to death.

123
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,914
They make minimum wage.

124
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,083
I used to work minimum wage,
and when I did,

125
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,002
I wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tip—worthy.

126
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,213
You don't care
they're counting on your tips to live?

127
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,551
You know what this is?

128
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,470
It's the world's smallest violin
playing just for the waitresses.

129
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,765
You don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

130
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,851
These people bust their ass.

131
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,352
This is a hard job.

132
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,979
So is working at McDonald's,

133
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,832
but you don't feel the need
to tip them, do you?

134
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,357
Why not? They're serving you food.

135
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,902
Society says, "don't tip these guys
over here, but tip these guys over here."

136
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,237
That's bullshit.

137
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,072
Waitressing is the number one occupation

138
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,200
for female noncollege graduates
in this country.

139
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:11,204
It's the one job basically
any woman can get and make a living on.

140
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,331
The reason is because of their tips.

141
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,084
Fuck all that.

142
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,588
Jesus Christ!

143
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,299
I'm very sorry the government
taxes their tips. That's fucked up.

144
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,717
But that ain't my fault.

145
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,094
It would appear that waitresses
are one of the many groups

146
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,263
the government fucks in the ass
on a regular basis.

147
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,973
I mean, show me a piece of paper

148
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,076
that says the government
shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.

149
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,820
Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it.
But what I won't do is play ball.

150
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,397
And this noncollege bullshit,
I got two words for that...

151
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,732
Learn to fucking type.

152
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,710
'Cause if you're expecting me
to help out with the rent,

153
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,277
you're in for a big fucking surprise.

154
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,112
He's convinced me. Give me my dollar back.

155
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,405
Hey!

156
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,574
Leave the dollars there.

157
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,161
All right, ramblers, let's get ramblin'.

158
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,873
Wait a minute. Who didn't throw in?

159
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,042
- Mr. Pink.
- Mr. Pink?

160
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,753
- Why not?
- He don't tip.

161
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,255
He don't tip?

162
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,715
What do you mean you don't tip?

163
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,425
- He don't believe in it.
- Shut up.

164
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,886
What do you mean you don't believe in it?

165
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,680
Come on, you.
Cough up a buck, you cheap bastard.

166
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,641
I paid for your goddamn breakfast.

167
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,660
All right, since you paid
for the breakfast, I'll put in,

168
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,603
but normally I would never do this.

169
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,857
Never mind what you normally would do.

170
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,027
Just cough in your goddamn buck
like everybody else.

171
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,320
Thank you.

172
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,133
That was the partridge family's

173
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,785
"doesn't somebody want to be wanted?"

174
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:37,207
Followed by Edison lighthouse's
"love grows"

175
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,919
As k-bi/iy's super sounds
of the '703 weekend

176
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,047
just keeps on truckin'.

177
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,677
J“ yeah j“

178
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,183
j“ lookin' back on the track j“

179
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,811

j“ or I'm losin' my mind j“

182
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,359
j“ out of sight in the night j“

183
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,861
j“ out of sight in the day j“

184
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,947
j“ lookin' back on the track j“

185
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,574
j“ gonna do it my way j“

186
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,493
j“ out of sight in the night j“

187
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,246
j“ out of sight in the day j“

188
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,123
j“ lookin' back on the track j“

189
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,750
j“ gonna do it my way j“

190
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,127
j“ lookin' back j“

191
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,926
J'ahhj'

192
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,928
j“ lookin' for some happiness j“

193
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:38,601
j“ but there is only loneliness to find j“

194
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,854
j“ jump to the left j“

195
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,189
j“ turn to the right j“

196
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,442
j“ lookin' upstairs j“

197
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,528
j“ lookin' behind j“

198
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,821
j“ yeah j“

199
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,965
J“ lookin' for some happiness j“

200
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:15,388
j“ but there is only loneliness to find j“

201
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,016
j“ jump to the left j“

202
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,268
j“ turn to the right j“

203
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,645
- J“ lookin' upstairs j“
-Oh, god!

204
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,732
-J“ lookin' behind j“ -oh, shit!

205
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,902
I'm gonna die!

206
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,988
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!

207
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,991
Just hold on, buddy boy!

208
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,534
I'm gonna die!

209
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,827
Hey!

210
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,413
I'm sorry!

211
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,292
- I can't believe she killed me, man.
- Give me your hand.

212
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,419
Who would've fucking thought that?

213
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,131
Hey! Just cancel that shit right now!

214
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:55,053
You're hurt. You're hurt real fucking bad,
but you ain't dying!

215
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,889
I'm gonna die! I'm gonna...

216
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,434
- Oh, shit.
- Oh!

217
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,354
All this blood is scaring
the shit out of me, Larry!

218
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,898
- I'm gonna die! I know it!
- Oh!

219
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,609
Excuse me. I didn't realize
you had a degree in medicine.

220
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,488
Uh, a-are you a doctor?

221
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,615
Are you a doctor?

222
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,535
Answer me, please. Are you a doctor?

223
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,620
Huh?

224
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,498
- No, I'm not. I'm not.
- Okay.

225
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,875
So you admit you don't know
what you're talking about.

226
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,754
So if you're through giving me
your amateur opinion,

227
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,381
just lie back and listen to the news.

228
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,550
I'm taking you back to the rendezvous.

229
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,718
Joe's gonna get you a doctor.

230
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:39,806
The doctor's gonna fix you up,
and you're gonna be okay.

231
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:44,477
Now say it! You're gonna be okay.

232
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,854
Say it!

233
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,897
You're gonna be okay!

234
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,943
Say the goddamn words.
You're gonna be okay.

235
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,486
Oh, god!

236
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,655
Say the goddamn fucking words!

237
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,323
Say it!

238
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,741
I'm okay, Larry.

239
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,702
Correct!

240
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,453
Correct.

241
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,749
I'm okay.

242
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,509
Look where we are.

243
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,262
- Look where we are.
- Larry...

244
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,473
You gotta save me, man!

245
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,184
You gotta save me!

246
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,352
We're in the warehouse.

247
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,771
Who's a tough guy?

248
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,565
Who's a tough guy?

249
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:35,862
- Come on. Who's a tough guy?
- I'm a tough guy, Larry!

250
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,197
You're a tough guy.

251
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,115
You're a fucking tough guy.

252
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,787
Okay. Okay.

253
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,289
We're in the warehouse.

254
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,666
Look where we are. We made it.

255
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,169
We made it. We fucking made it.

256
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,381
We have fucking made it.

257
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,551
We're in the warehouse. Look where we are.

258
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,929
Look where we are.

259
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,640
Just hold on, buddy boy. Hold on.

260
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,017
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Oh...

261
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,102
Shit!

262
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,479
Stop banging your head.

263
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,362
You're gonna bang
a fucking hole in the floor.

264
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,777
Yeah, you don't want to hurt
the fucking floor, do you?

265
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,406
I can't do anything for you,
but when Joe gets here,

266
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,245
which should be any time now,
he's gonna help you out.

267
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,288
He's gonna take care of you. Okay?

268
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,412
We're just gonna sit here,
we're gonna wait for Joe.

269
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,794
Who are we waiting for?

270
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,837
Joe.

271
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,339
Yeah, that's right.

272
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:43,221
Larry, I'm so fucking scared, man.

273
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,102
Would you please hold me?

274
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,728
Yeah, sure.

275
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,339
You go ahead and be scared.

276
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,801
You've been brave enough for one day.

277
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,392
I just want you to relax now, okay?

278
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,894
You're not gonna fucking die.
You're gonna be fine.

279
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,981
When Joe gets here,
he'll make you 100% again.

280
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,652
I'm hurt. I'm hurt bad, Larry.

281
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,781
It's not good. No...

282
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,283
Hey, Larry...

283
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,078
Bless your heart
for what you're trying to do.

284
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,166
I was panicking for a minute back there,

285
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,669
but I got my senses back now.

286
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,673
Situation is I'm shot in the belly.

287
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,468
Without medical attention, I'm gonna die.

288
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,057
Uh, I can't take you to a hospital.

289
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,975
Fuck jail, man!

290
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,896
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up to the front, man.

291
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,359
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself.

292
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,490
I won't tell them anything, man.
I won't tell them anything.

293
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,618
I swear to fucking god, man.

294
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,165
Just look in my eyes, Larry.
Look in my eyes.

295
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:39,253
I won't tell them anything.

296
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,006
You'll be safe, man.

297
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,677
You're not gonna fucking die, kid.
All right?

298
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,556
Listen to me. You're gonna be fine.

299
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,351
Along with the kneecap,

300
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,729
the gut is the most painful area
a guy can get shot in.

301
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,022
No shit.

302
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,775
But it takes a long time to die from it.

303
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,402
I'm talking days.

304
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,446
You're gonna wish you were dead,

305
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,698
but it takes days to die from your wound.

306
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,426
Time is on your side.

307
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,494
Was that a fucking setup or what?

308
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,121
Fucking right!

309
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,331
Shit! Orange got tagged?

310
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,542
Gutshot.

311
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:20,461
Fuck! Where's, uh, brown?

312
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:21,879
Dead.

313
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,382
Oh! How did he die?

314
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,301
How the fuck do you think?

315
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,803
The cops shot him.

316
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,515
This is bad. This is so fucking bad.

317
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,684
Is it bad?

318
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,477
As opposed to good?

319
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,772
Man, this is fucked up.

320
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:41,274
This is so fucked up.

321
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,694
Somebody fucked us up big time, man.

322
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,574
You really think we were set up?

323
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,826
Do you even doubt it, man?

324
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,846
I don't think we got set up,
I know we got set up.

325
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,414
Seriously, where did
all those cops come from, huh?

326
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,767
One minute, they're not there,
the next minute, they're there?

327
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,376
I didn't hear any sirens.

328
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,045
The alarm went off, okay.
When an alarm goes off,

329
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,815
you got an average
of four minutes response time.

330
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,484
Unless a patrol car is cruising
that street at that particular moment,

331
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,052
you got four minutes
before they can realistically respond.

332
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,305
In one minute,
there were 17 blue boys out there,

333
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,950
all loaded for bear, all knowing
exactly what the fuck they were doing.

334
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,601
They were all just there.

335
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,521
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars?

336
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,124
Those were the ones
responding to the alarm.

337
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,485
Those first motherfuckers,
I'm telling you, they were waiting for us.

338
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,653
Haven't you fucking thought about this?

339
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,198
I haven't had a chance to think.

340
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,618
First, I was just trying to
get the fuck out of there.

341
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,038
And after we got away,
I've just been dealing with him.

342
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,058
Let's start fucking thinking about it.
'Cause that's all I'm thinking about.

343
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,211
I wasn't even gonna come here.
I was gonna just drive off.

344
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,588
Because whoever set us up
knows about this place.

345
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,511
There could have been cops here
waiting for us.

346
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,718
There could be cops
coming here right now!

347
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:56,390
Let's go in the other room. Hey! In there.

348
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,101
Don't leave me!

349
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,811
I'm gonna die.

350
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,147
I'm just gonna be in that room.
Just over the other side.

351
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,233
I'll be right there, okay?

352
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:07,235
I'll be right there looking at you.

353
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,320
I'm right here looking at you, okay?

354
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,533
Lie down. Right in here. Right over there.

355
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,662
Larry.

356
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,790
I'm gonna fucking die.

357
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,083
Larry!

358
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,213
What the fuck am I doing here, man?

359
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,423
You know, I felt funny
about this job right off.

360
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,777
As soon as I felt it, I should have said,
"no, thank you," and walked,

361
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,219
but I didn't fucking listen.

362
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,583
It's like every time I got caught
buying weed, same thing.

363
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,450
I didn't trust the guy, felt funny
about him, but I wanted to believe him.

364
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,411
Because if he's not lying, and it really
is Thai stick, then it's great, right?

365
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,687
But no, it's never Thai stick.

366
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,815
I always said if I felt that way about
a job, I'd fucking walk and I didn't!

367
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,043
I didn't 'cause of the fucking money!

368
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,695
What's done is done. I need you cool.

369
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,197
Are you cool?

370
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,117
All right, I'm cool.

371
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,996
Splash some water on your face.

372
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,168
Take a breather.

373
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,810
Relax. Have a cigarette.

374
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,647
- I quit.
- All right.

375
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,065
Why, you got one?

376
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,325
Yeah.

377
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,912
Here you go. Have a chesterfield.

378
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,706
Thanks.

379
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:05,061
- Okay. Let's go through what happened.
- Okay.

380
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,146
We're in the place.
Everything's going fine.

381
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,565
- Then the alarm gets tripped.
- Right.

382
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,861
I turn around
and all these cops are outside.

383
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,283
You're right, because bam,
I blink my eyes, and they're there.

384
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,577
Everybody starts going apeshit.

385
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,288
Then Mr. Blonde
starts to shoot all the em...

386
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,581
That's not correct.

387
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,584
- What's wrong with it?
- Okay.

388
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,170
The cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.

389
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,715
The cops didn't show up until after
Mr. Blonde started shooting everybody.

390
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,926
As soon as I heard the alarm,
I saw the cops.

391
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,528
No, I'm telling you,
it wasn't that soon, okay?

392
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:42,056
They didn't let their presence be known
until after Mr. Blonde became a madman.

393
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,579
I'm not saying they weren't there.
I'm saying they were there.

394
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,435
But they didn't make their move

395
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,896
until after Mr. Blonde
started shooting everybody.

396
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,981
That's how I know we were set up.

397
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,502
Come on, Mr. White,
you... you could see that.

398
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,403
Look, look! Enough of this Mr. White shit.

399
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,613
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't tell me your fucking name!

400
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,073
I don't want to know it.

401
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,158
Jesus Christ, I ain't gonna tell you mine.

402
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,541
You're right. This is bad.

403
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,006
How did you get out?

404
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,259
I shot my way out.

405
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,761
Everybody started shooting,
so I blasted my way out of there.

406
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,143
Move it! Get out of the way!

407
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,853
Get the fuck out of the way!

408
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,481
Get the fuck out of the way!

409
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,818
-Move it! —get out of the way!

410
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,660
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is your problem, man?

411
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,078
You fucking asshole!

412
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,872
Fucked...

413
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:48,956
Move!

414
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,374
Get down, Ernie!

415
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,548
Jesus!

416
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,050
Get out of the car!
Get the fuck out of the car!

417
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,344
Move it! Move out of the way!

418
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,250
I tagged a couple of cops.

419
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:37,463
- Did you kill anybody?
- A few cops.

420
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,340
No real people?

421
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,716
Just cops.

422
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,772
Man, could you believe Mr. Blonde?

423
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,193
That was the most insane fucking thing
I have ever seen.

424
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,071
Why the fuck would Joe
hire a guy like that?

425
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,614
I don't want to kill anybody.

426
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,468
If I gotta get out that door
and you're standing in my way,

427
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,661
one way or the other,
you're getting out of my way.

428
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,287
That's the way I look at it.

429
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:15,960
The choice between doing ten years
and taking out some stupid motherfucker...

430
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,922
Ain't no choice at all.

431
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,007
But I ain't no madman, either.

432
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,677
What the fuck was Joe thinking?

433
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,428
Can't work with a guy like that.

434
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,309
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us
when he shot the place up.

435
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,604
I came this close
to taking his ass out myself.

436
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,483
I mean, everybody panics. Everybody.

437
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,987
Things get tense.
It's human nature, you panic.

438
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,072
I don't care what your name is.
You can't help it.

439
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:49,952
Fuck, man, you panic on the inside.
In your head, you know?

440
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,496
You give yourself a couple of seconds.

441
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,975
You get a-— you get a hold
of the situation. You deal with it.

442
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,477
What you don't do is start shooting up
the place and start killing people.

443
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,504
No. What you're supposed to do
is act like a fucking professional.

444
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,591
A psychopath ain't a professional.

445
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,427
Can't work with a psychopath.

446
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,971
You don't know what those sick assholes
are gonna do next.

447
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:15,227
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old
do you think that black girl was, 20?

448
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,646
- Maybe 21?
- If that.

449
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,859
Hey, look, did you see
what happened to anybody else?

450
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,405
Me and orange jumped in the car,
brown floored it.

451
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,908
After that, I don't know what went down.

452
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,285
Well, at that point,
it was every man for himself.

453
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,472
As far as Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue
are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest.

454
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,498
'Cause once I got out,
I never looked back.

455
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,293
- What do you think?
- What do I think?

456
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,129
I mean, you know, the cops
either caught 'em or killed 'em.

457
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,467
No chance they punched through?
You found a hole.

458
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,302
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle.

459
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,513
But even if they did get away,
then where the fuck are they?

460
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,328
You don't think it's possible one of them
got a hold of the diamonds and...

461
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,937
No. No way.

462
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,647
How can you be so sure?

463
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,650
I got the diamonds.

464
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,534
That's my boy.

465
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,330
- W here?
- I stashed 'em.

466
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,207
Look, if you want to come with me,

467
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,584
let's go get 'em right now,
right this second, man.

468
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:24,338
'Cause I think staying here, man,
we should have our fucking heads examined.

469
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,465
That was the plan. We meet here.

470
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,300
Then where the fuck is everybody?

471
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,595
I say the plan becomes null and void once
we find out we got a rat in the house.

472
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,879
We ain't got the slightest fucking idea
what happened to Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue.

473
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,934
They could both be dead
or maybe they're arrested.

474
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:40,270
The cops could have 'em right now
at the station house, sweatin' 'em down.

475
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:43,357
They don't know our names, but they
could be singin' about this place.

476
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,868
I swear to god,
I think I'm fucking jinxed.

477
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,829
What?

478
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,750
Two jobs back, it was a four-man job.

479
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,962
We discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

480
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,215
No shit.

481
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,261
Thank god we discovered it in time.

482
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,055
Had to forget the whole thing,
just walk the fuck away from it.

483
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,017
So who's the rat this time?

484
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:19,852
Mr. Blue?

485
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,062
Mr. Brown?

486
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,564
Joe?

487
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,692
Listen, Joe set this whole thing up.
Maybe he set it up to set it up.

488
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,110
I don't buy it.

489
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,362
Me and Joe go back a long time.

490
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,657
I can tell you definitely, Joe don't know
a fucking thing about this bullshit.

491
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,743
Hey, look, I've known Joe
since I was a kid, okay?

492
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,579
And me saying he definitely
had nothing to do with it is ridiculous.

493
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,641
I can say I definitely didn't do it
'cause I know what I did or I didn't do,

494
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,393
but I cannot definitely say that
about anybody else

495
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,127
'cause I don't definitely know.

496
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,754
For all I know, you're the rat.

497
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,381
For all I know, you're the fucking rat!

498
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,176
All right! Now you're using
your fucking head!

499
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,927
For all we know, he's the rat.

500
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:58,182
Hey, that kid in there is dying
from a fucking bullet I saw him take,

501
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,267
so don't you be calling him a rat!

502
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,770
Look, I'm right, okay?

503
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,480
Somebody's a fucking rat.

504
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,738
Where's the commode in this dungeon?
I gotta take a squirt.

505
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:19,578
Go down the hall, make a left,
go up the stairs, and make a right.

506
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,671
By the way, how's Alabama?

507
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,757
Alabama? Hmm.

508
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,384
I haven't seen 'bama
in over a year and a half.

509
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,346
I thought you two were a team.

510
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,974
We were for a little while.

511
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:44,686
Did about four jobs together,
then decided to call it quits.

512
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,896
Why?

513
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,568
Mmm, you push that
woman-man thing too long

514
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,237
and it gets to you after a while.

515
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,489
What's she doing now?

516
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:59,118
She hooked up with frank mcgarr.
They've done a couple jobs together.

517
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,286
Hell of a woman. Good little thief.

518
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,875
So explain the telegram.

519
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,669
Five-man job,

520
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,004
busting in and busting out
of a diamond wholesaler's.

521
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:14,091
Can you move the ice afterwards?
I don't know nobody that can move ice.

522
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,301
No problem. We got guys waiting for it.

523
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,805
What happened to Marcellus spivey?
Didn't he always move your ice?

524
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,224
He's doing 20 years in susanville.

525
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,561
Twenty years? Holy god. What for?

526
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,062
Bad luck.

527
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,981
I guess you could say that again.

528
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,859
What's the exposure like?

529
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,820
Two minutes tops,
but it's a tough two minutes.

530
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,906
Daylight during business hours,
dealing with the crowd.

531
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,909
But you'll have the guys
to deal with the crowd.

532
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,327
How many employees?

533
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,622
I'd say around 20. Security pretty lax.

534
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:47,624
They most usuallyjust deal in boxes.

535
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,044
You know, uncut stones
from the diamond syndicate.

536
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,713
But on this particular day,

537
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,382
they're getting a shipment
of polished stones from Israel.

538
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:58,177
They're like a way station, you know?

539
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,554
They're to get picked up the next day
and sent to Vermont.

540
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,722
No, they're not.

541
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,560
What's the cut, papa?

542
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,062
Juicy, junior.

543
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,857
Real juicy.

544
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,070
Hey, look, man, you do what you want.
I'm out of here, man.

545
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,072
I'm gonna check into a motel
for a few days.

546
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:21,158
You know, I'll lay low,
and I'll call Joe...

547
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,994
Oh, shit. Did he fucking die on us?

548
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,123
Huh? Is he dead or what?

549
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,169
He ain't dead.

550
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,462
What is it?

551
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,218
Scared the fucking shit out of me, man.
I thought he was dead for sure.

552
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,180
Without medical attention,
he will die for sure.

553
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,808
What are we gonna do, man?
We can't take him to a hospital.

554
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,940
Without medical attention,
that man might not live through the night.

555
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,734
The bullet in his belly is my fault.

556
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,905
While that might not mean Jack shit
to you, it means a hell of a lot to me.

557
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,658
First things first. Staying here is goofy.
We gotta book up.

558
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:06,161
What do you suggest we do, go to a hotel?

559
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,580
We got a guy shot in the belly.
He can't walk.

560
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,499
He bleeds like a stuck pig.

561
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,751
When he's awake, he screams in pain.

562
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:16,004
You got an idea, spit it out.

563
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,923
Joe could help.

564
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,633
We get in touch with Joe.

565
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,844
Joe could get him to a doctor.

566
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,805
Joe could get a doctor to come to see him.

567
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,642
Assuming we can trust Joe,
how are we gonna get in touch with him?

568
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,020
Huh? He's supposed to be here,
but he ain't,

569
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,106
which is making me very nervous
about being here.

570
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,941
Even if he is on the up-and-up,

571
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,961
I don't think he's gonna be
too happy with us, okay?

572
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,505
He planned a robbery,
and he's got a bloodbath on his hands now.

573
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,240
He's got dead cops,
dead robbers, dead civilians.

574
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,035
Jesus Christ, I... I tend to doubt
he's gonna have sympathy for our plight.

575
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,163
If I was him, I'd try and put as much
distance between me and this mess

576
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,748
as humanly possible.

577
00:29:55,335 --> 00:30:00,549
Before you got here, Mr. Orange
was asking me to take him to a doctor,

578
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,925
to a hospital.

579
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,014
I don't like the idea
of turning him over to the cops,

580
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,057
but if we don't, he's gonna die.

581
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,310
He begged me to do it.

582
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:16,648
Well, all right, then I guess
we take him to a hospital.

583
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,233
If that's what he said, let's do it.

584
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,695
Since he don't know nothing about us,
I say it's his decision.

585
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,405
Well, he knows a little about me.

586
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:27,868
What?

587
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,953
Wait, wait.
You didn't tell him your name, did you?

588
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,247
I told him my first name
and where I was from.

589
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,333
Why?

590
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,170
I told him where I was from
a few days ago.

591
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,672
It was just a natural conversation.

592
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,593
What was telling him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

593
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,011
He asked.

594
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:51,266
We had just gotten away from the cops.
He just got shot.

595
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,602
It was my fault he got shot.

596
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,314
He's a fucking bloody mess.

597
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,690
He's screaming.

598
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,111
I swear to god, I thought
he was gonna die right then and there.

599
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,821
I'm trying to comfort him,

600
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,241
telling him not to worry,
everything is gonna be okay,

601
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,743
I'm gonna take care of him.

602
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,662
And he asked me what my name was.

603
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,042
I mean, the man was dying in my arms.

604
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,461
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

605
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:25,050
Tell him, "I'm sorry.
I can't give out that fucking information!

606
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,677
It's against the rules!

607
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,680
I don't trust you enough!"

608
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,975
Well, maybe I should've, but I couldn't.

609
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,479
- I don't...
- Fuck you, and fuck Joe!

610
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,802
Yeah, I'm sure it was a very beautiful
scene between you.

611
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,085
- Don't fucking patronize me!
- I got one question for you.

612
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,669
Do they have a sheet on you,
where you're from?

613
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,946
- Yeah!
- Well, that's that then, man.

614
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,907
Jesus Christ, I was worried about
mug shot possibilities as it was.

615
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,284
Now he knows a, your name,
b, what you look like,

616
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,346
c, where you're from,
and d, what your specialty is.

617
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,349
They're not gonna have to show him
a lot of pictures for him to pick you out.

618
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:57,874
I mean, that's it, right?

619
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:00,478
You didn't tell him anything else
that could narrow down the selection?

620
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,922
If I have to tell you again to back off,
me and you are gonna go round and round.

621
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,799
We ain't taking him to a hospital.

622
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,718
If we don't, he's gonna die.

623
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,763
And I'm very sad about that
but some fellas are lucky and some ain't.

624
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,516
What the fuck
are you touching me for, man?

625
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,999
You wanna fuck with me!
I'll show you who you're fucking with!

626
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,252
You want to shoot me, you piece of shit?
Go ahead. Take a shot.

627
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,735
Fuck you, white.

628
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,029
I didn't create this situation.
I'm dealing with it.

629
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,799
You're acting like
a first-year fucking thief.

630
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,283
I'm acting like a professional!

631
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,951
If they get him, they can get you.

632
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,454
They get you, they get closer to me,
and that can't happen!

633
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,956
You're looking at me like it's my fault?

634
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,750
I didn't tell him my name.
I didn't tell him where I was from.

635
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,171
Shit, 15 minutes ago
you almost told me your name.

636
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,506
Your buddy got us stuck
in a situation you created.

637
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,342
So if you want to throw bad looks
somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror!

638
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,095
You kids shouldn't play so rough.

639
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,931
Somebody's gonna start crying.

640
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,601
Mr. Blonde.

641
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:01,980
Shit. Fucking kicking me.

642
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,278
What happened to you?

643
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,614
I figured you were dead.

644
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:16,495
Hey! You okay?

645
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:20,499
Did you see what happened to blue?

646
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,185
We didn't know what happened
to you and blue.

647
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,211
That's what we were wondering about.
Come on, man.

648
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,174
Look, brown is dead,
orange got it in the belly.

649
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,510
Enough! Enough!

650
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,762
You better start talking, asshole,

651
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,557
'cause we got shit we need to talk about.

652
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,351
We're already freaked out.

653
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,812
We need you acting freaky
like we need a fucking bag on our hip.

654
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,607
Okay. Let's talk.

655
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,151
We think we got a rat in the house.

656
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,153
I guarantee we got a rat in the house.

657
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,030
What makes you say that?

658
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,157
Is that supposed to be funny?

659
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,576
Look, we think this place ain't safe.

660
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,245
This place just ain't secure anymore.
We're leaving. You should go with us.

661
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,082
Nobody's going anwvhere.

662
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,669
Piss on this fucking turd!

663
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,337
We're out of here.

664
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,922
Don't take another step, Mr. White.

665
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,716
Fuck you, maniac!

666
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,514
It's your fucking fault
we're in this trouble.

667
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,182
What's this guy's problem?

668
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,600
What's my problem?

669
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,227
Yeah, I got a fucking problem.

670
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,437
I got a big fucking problem

671
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:28,191
with any trigger-happy madman
almost gets me shot!

672
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,945
What the fuck you talking about?

673
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,738
That fucking shooting spree!

674
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,284
In the store, remember?

675
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,953
Oh, fuck 'em. They set off the alarm.

676
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,038
They deserve what they got.

677
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:44,124
You almost killed me!

678
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,459
Asshole!

679
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,382
If I'd known what kind of guy you were,
I never would've agreed to work with you.

680
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,137
Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy,

681
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,015
or are you gonna bite?

682
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,975
What was that?

683
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,271
I'm sorry. I didn't catch it.

684
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,690
Would you repeat it?

685
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,943
Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy,

686
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,779
or are you gonna bite?

687
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:17,365
Oh, Christ. Look, you two assholes,
calm the fuck down.

688
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,619
Hey, come on!
What, are we on a playground here, huh?

689
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,412
Am I the only professional?

690
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,914
You're acting like a bunch
of fucking niggers, man.

691
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,374
You ever worked with niggers, huh?

692
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,227
Just like you two, always saying
they're gonna kill each other.

693
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,146
You said yourself
you thought about taking him out.

694
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,839
- You fucking said that?
- Yeah, I did, okay? I did.

695
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:36,343
But that was then. Right now, this guy
is the only one I completely trust.

696
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,446
He's too fucking homicidal
to be working with the cops.

697
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,805
- You're taking his side?
- —no! Fuck sides, man!

698
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,515
What we need is a little solidarity.

699
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,285
Somebody's sticking
a red-hot poker up our asses.

700
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,144
I want to know whose name's on the handle.

701
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,397
Fuck.

702
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,441
Look, I know I'm no piece of shit,

703
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,401
and I'm pretty sure you're okay.

704
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,320
And I'm fucking positive
you're on the level.

705
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,907
Let's try and figure out
who the bad guy is, all right?

706
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,495
Wow.

707
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,498
That was really exciting.

708
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,418
I bet you're a big Lee Marvin fan,
aren't you?

709
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,256
Me, too. I love that guy.

710
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,387
My heart's beating so fast,
I'm about to have a heart attack here.

711
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,222
Yeah?

712
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:27,060
I got something outside that, uh,
I'd like to show you guys, so follow me.

713
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,020
Follow you? Where?

714
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,439
To my car.

715
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,193
What, did you forget your French fries
to go with the soda?

716
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,153
- I had them already.
- Yeah?

717
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,256
I got something I think
you might want to see, though.

718
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,532
- What?
- It's a big surprise.

719
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,660
I'm sure you'll like it. Come on.

720
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,423
We still gotta get out of here, you know.

721
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,925
No. We're gonna stick around,
we're gonna wait.

722
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,761
- What for, the cops?
- No. Nice guy Eddie.

723
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,763
- Nice guy Eddie?
- Yeah.

724
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:07,058
What makes you think he isn't on a plane
right now halfway to Costa Rica?

725
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:10,228
Because I spoke to him on the phone
and he said he's on the way down here.

726
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,646
You talked to nice guy Eddie?

727
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,773
Why the fuck didn't you say that
in the first place?

728
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,233
'Cause you never asked me.

729
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,485
Hardy-fucking-har. What'd he say?

730
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,904
He said stay put.

731
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,823
So in the meantime...

732
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,576
I'll show you guys something.

733
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,332
Jesus Christ.

734
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,645
Maybe our boy in blue here
can answer some of these questions

735
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,922
about this rat business
you've been talking about.

736
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,758
You're a piece of work, my friend.

737
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,011
Ain't a bad idea.
Let's get him the fuck out of here.

738
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,599
Hey, sid, will you relax?

739
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,267
I know you a long time.

740
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,561
I'm not worried.
I know you'll pay me back.

741
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,482
Don't tell me what I already know.
Don't embarrass me.

742
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:59,152
So you had a few bad months.

743
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,653
You do what everybody else does.

744
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:03,782
I don't care if it's jp Morgan
or Irving the tailor.

745
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:05,533
You ride it out.

746
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,660
- Vic vega's outside.
- Hold on.

747
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,371
- W ho?
- Vic vega.

748
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,207
Oh, tell him to come in.

749
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,959
- I gotta go. A friend of mine's outside.
- Come on in.

750
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,170
Keep your chin up. I'll be talking to you.

751
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,463
Don't worry.

752
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,220
Hey, welcome home, Vic.

753
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,596
Joe.

754
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,181
How does freedom feel, huh?

755
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,141
It's a change.

756
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,143
Ain't that the sad truth?

757
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,646
Sit down. Take your coat off.
Make yourself at home.

758
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,023
- Want a little drink?
- Yeah.

759
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,317
How about a little, uh, rémy Martin?

760
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,027
Sure.

761
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,780
Who's your parole officer?

762
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,200
Seymour scagnetti.

763
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:48,993
How is he?

764
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,288
He's a fucking asshole.

765
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:54,207
Won't even let me leave the halfway house.

766
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,417
You know, it never ceases to amaze me.

767
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,212
A fucking jungle bunny goes out there,

768
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,339
slits some old woman's throat
for 25 cents,

769
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,175
he gets Doris day for a parole officer.

770
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:07,595
Good fella like you winds up
with a ball-busting prick.

771
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,432
I want you to know I appreciate

772
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,393
all the packages
you sent me on the inside.

773
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,604
What the hell was I supposed to do,
forget about you?

774
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,400
I just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.

775
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,235
Hey, it was the least I could do.

776
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,112
I wish to hell I could have done
a lot more.

777
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,822
Thanks a lot, Joe.

778
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,658
Ah, Vic.

779
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,538
Toothpick Vic.

780
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:39,502
So tell me your story, kid.
What are your plans?

781
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,087
You son of a bitch.

782
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,131
I see you sitting there,
but I don't believe it.

783
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,383
- How you doing, toothpick?
- Hey, Eddie.

784
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,843
Ahh!

785
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,011
All right!

786
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,600
Listen, I'm sorry.
I should've picked you up myself.

787
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:56,394
I was... my fucking... I mean, it's been...
This week's been crazy.

788
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,229
I've had my head up my ass the whole time.

789
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,772
It's funny you should say that

790
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,959
'cause that's what me and your daddy
were just talking about.

791
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,735
That I should have picked you up?

792
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,820
No, that you had your head up your ass.

793
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:12,660
I walk in the door, he's like,
"Vic, I'm so glad somebody's finally here

794
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,704
who knows what's going on.

795
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,414
My son Eddie is a fuck-up.

796
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,208
He's ruining the business.

797
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:22,003
I mean, I love the guy,

798
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,922
but he's flushing everything
down the toilet."

799
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,966
That's what you said, right, Joe?
Tell him yourself.

800
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,552
Eddie, I hate for you
to hear it like this,

801
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:33,181
but, you know, Vic come in
and asked me how business was.

802
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,518
You don't lie to a guy
who's just done four years in the slammer.

803
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:38,728
Very true.

804
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,402
All right! Enough of this shit!
Break it up!

805
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,488
Come on! This ain't a playground!

806
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:58,039
You guys want to roll around on the floor,
you do it in Eddie's office, not mine.

807
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,083
- —Daddy, did you see that?
- What?

808
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,961
Guy got me on the ground,
he tried to fuck me.

809
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,379
You wish.

810
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,797
You sick bastard, Vic.

811
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,966
You tried to fuck me
in my father's office.

812
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:12,470
Look, Vic, whatever you want to do
in the privacy of your own home, go to it,

813
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,888
but don't try to fuck me.

814
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,140
I mean, I... I don't think of you that way.

815
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,977
I like you a lot, buddy,
but I don't think of you that way.

816
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:26,693
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy,
I wouldn't even throw you to the posse.

817
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,821
No, you wouldn't.
You'd keep me for yourself.

818
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,949
You know, four years
fucking punks up the ass,

819
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,885
you'd appreciate a piece of prime rib
when you see it.

820
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:38,246
I might break you in, nice guy,
but I'd make you my dog's bitch.

821
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,123
Ain't that a sad sight, daddy?

822
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,334
A man walks into prison a white man,
walks out talking like a fuckin' nigger.

823
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,254
You know what?
I think it's all that black semen

824
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,839
been pumped up your ass so far,

825
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,925
now it's backed into your fucking brain,
it's coming out your mouth.

826
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:55,722
Eddie, you keep talking like a bitch,
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

827
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,683
All right, enough of this shit!
I'm sick of it!

828
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,309
Now, both of you sit down.

829
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:11,320
Now, Eddie, when you came in here,
we were talking some serious business.

830
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,490
Now, Vic here's got a parole problem.

831
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:15,825
Who's your po?

832
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,410
Seymour scagnetti.

833
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,121
Scagnetti. Fuck.

834
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,416
- I hear he's a motherfucker.
- Oh, he's a fucker.

835
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,503
Won't even let me leave the halfway house
unless I get some shittyjob.

836
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,964
You're coming back to work for us, right?

837
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,719
Well, I want to.

838
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,556
First, I gotta prove to, uh, asshead

839
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,976
that I can get a regular,
you know, job-job-type job,

840
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,811
before I can move out on my own.

841
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,773
I can't come back to work for you guys

842
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:50,902
if I gotta worry about, uh,
making some silly-ass ten o'clock curfew

843
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,320
every fucking night.

844
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,490
All right, we can work this out,
can't we, Eddie?

845
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,451
This ain't all that bad.

846
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,745
We can get you a lot of legitimate jobs.

847
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,457
I'll get you down into long beach
as a dock worker.

848
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,584
I don't want to lift
no fucking crates, Eddie.

849
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,087
Vic, you ain't gonna lift shit.

850
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,589
You don't even work there.

851
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,716
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.

852
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,029
I'll call Matthews the foreman
and tell him he's got a new guy.

853
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,513
Boom, you're on the rotation.

854
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,475
You get a time card.
It's clocked in and out for you every day.

855
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,438
At the end of the week,
you get a nice paycheck.

856
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,145
Dock workers do very well.

857
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,316
So you can move into a halfway decent
place without the scagnetti fuck going,

858
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,276
"hey, where the fuck's
the money coming from?"

859
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,946
And if he decides to make
a surprise visit,

860
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:39,700
that's the day we sent you to tustin,
pick up a load of shit and bring it back.

861
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:44,539
If he comes back again,
"hey, sorry, Seymour. You just missed him.

862
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:48,709
We had to send him to the taft airstrip
five fucking hours away.

863
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,688
We had a load of shit we had to have him
pick up there and bring back here."

864
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:55,216
Part of your job, Vic, is going
different places. That's the beauty of it.

865
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,301
We got places all over the place.

866
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:00,221
See, Vic? Did I tell you not to worry?

867
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,348
Here Vic was worried.

868
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,183
I'll take you down to long beach tomorrow.

869
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,894
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews,
I'll tell him what's what.

870
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,692
You know, I really appreciate
what you guys are doing,

871
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,777
but I'd like to know when I can come back,

872
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,738
you know, do some real work.

873
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,116
Well, it's hard to say.

874
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,035
It's kind of a strange time now.

875
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,037
Things are kind of...

876
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,456
They're a little fucked up
is what they are.

877
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,878
We're just getting ready
for a big meeting right now in Vegas.

878
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:36,465
Look, just let Eddie for now
set you up at long beach,

879
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:39,844
get you a job, give you some cash,

880
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:43,181
and get this scagnetti fuck off your back.

881
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,391
Then we'll talk to you, all right?

882
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,602
Huh?

883
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,728
Dad...

884
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,314
Igotanidea.

885
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,399
Now, just... just hear me out.

886
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,944
I know you don't like
using the boys on these jobs,

887
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:02,200
but Vic here, he's only been
nothing but good luck for us.

888
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:05,286
The guy's a fucking rabbit's foot,
for crying out loud.

889
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:08,122
I'd like to have him in.

890
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:12,543
You know he can handle himself,
and you damn sure know you can trust him.

891
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:18,466
Vic, how would you feel
about pulling a job

892
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,760
with about five other guys?

893
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:25,932
I'd feel great about it.

894
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:33,606
K-Billy's
super sounds of the '703 continues.

895
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,775
And if you're the 12th caller,

896
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,445
you'll win two tickets
to the monster truck extravaganza

897
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:42,698
being held tonight
at the Carson fairgrounds,

898
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:47,703
featuring big daddy Don bodine's truck,
the behemoth.

899
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:52,708
The 12th caller wins on the station
where the '703 survived.

900
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,293
J“ I gotcha! J“

901
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:55,836
j“ uh-huh, huh j“

902
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,920
j“ you thought
I didn't see you now, didn't you? J“

903
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,591
hey, dove, we got a major situation here.

904
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:02,468
I know you know that.

905
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,887
I gotta talk to daddy
and find out what he wants done.

906
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:06,806
J“ give it here, come on! J“

907
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,850
j“ hey! J“ -

908
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,560
J“ good god, hey! J“

909
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,689
All I know is what Vic told me, man.

910
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,233
He said the place
turned into a fucking bullet festival.

911
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,694
He took a cop hostage
just to get the fuck out of there.

912
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,570
Get up! Get up!

913
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:24,824
J“ you promised me the day
that you quit your boyfriend j“

914
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,076
do I sound like I'm fucking joking?

915
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,537
He's fucking driving around
with a cop in his trunk!

916
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,208
J“ you promised me
it would be just us two j“

917
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:35,751
I don't know who did what!

918
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:39,505
I... I don't know who's got the loot.
I don't know if anybody's got the loot.

919
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,358
I don't know who's dead.
I don't know who's alive.

920
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,342
I don't know who's caught.
I don't know who's not.

921
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:46,053
J“ you never should've promised to me
give it here j“

922
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:48,597
j“ don't hold back now, give it here j“

923
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,516
j“ don't say nothin', just give it here j“

924
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:53,728
j“ come on, give it here
uh, give it here j“

925
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,980
j“ give it here, give it here j“

926
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,606
j“ give it to me now j“

927
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,025
j“ hey! I gotcha! J“

928
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:01,736
I will know. I'm practically there now.

929
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,573
But what do I tell these guys about daddy?

930
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,454
All right.
You're sure that's what he said?

931
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,540
Okay, that's what I'll tell 'em.

932
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,669
Huh? Fuck you!
You like being a fucking hero, huh?

933
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:20,171
You like being a fucking hero, huh?

934
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,797
You like being a fucking hero? Fuck!

935
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,966
Ow, fuck!

936
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:26,927
You're gonna suffer for nothing, pal.

937
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,847
You hear me?
'Cause you're gonna fucking talk.

938
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,034
- You're gonna fucking talk.
- I don't fucking know anything!

939
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:35,978
You fucking know. You know.
Look at me. You fucking know.

940
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:38,397
What in the Sam hill's going on here?

941
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,459
- You're asking what's going on?
- Hey, nice guy, we got a cop.

942
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:41,901
Where the fuck is Joe?

943
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,904
Holy shit. Orange is dead.

944
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,949
No, he's not dead, but he will be
if we don't get him taken care of.

945
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,494
We were set up.
The cops were there waiting for us.

946
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,788
What? Nobody fucking set anybody up.

947
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,374
- The cops were there waiting for us, man.
- Bullshit.

948
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,334
Hey, fuck you, man!
You weren't there, we were!

949
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,669
I'm telling you the cops
had that store staked out.

950
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:04,048
Okay, Mr. Fucking detective,
you're so fucking smart.

951
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,341
Huh? Who did it?

952
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,486
What the hell do you think
we've been asking each other?

953
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,761
What did you come up with, huh?

954
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,180
You think I did it?
You think I fucking set you up?

955
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,349
I don't know, but somebody did.

956
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:15,935
Nobody did.

957
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,187
You fucking assholes
turned a jewelry store into...

958
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,730
Don't you call me an asshole!

959
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,273
You fucking idiot.

960
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,335
Turned a fucking jewelry store
into a wild west show,

961
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,903
and you wonder why
the fucking cops show up!

962
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,864
Where's Joseph?

963
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:32,368
I don't know. I ain't talked to him.
I talked to dove.

964
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,995
He said daddy's coming down here
and he's fucking pissed!

965
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,207
He's pissed? I told you he'd be pissed.

966
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,750
What did Joe say?

967
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,710
I told you I ain't talked to him!

968
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:43,379
All I know is he's pissed.

969
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,755
What are you gonna do about him?

970
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:47,466
Jesus Christ, give me
a fucking chance to breathe.

971
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:48,968
I got a few questions of my own.

972
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,511
You ain't dying. He is.

973
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,014
All right, Mr. Fucking compassion,
I will call somebody!

974
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,182
Who?

975
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,102
A fucking snake charmer. Who do you think?

976
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,230
I'll call a doctor!
He'll fix him right up.

977
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,524
Now, what happened to brown and blue?

978
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,651
Brown's dead.
We don't know what happened to blue.

979
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,362
Brown's dead? Are you sure?

980
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:10,239
I'm sure. I was there.

981
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,657
He took one in the head.

982
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,951
Nobody's got a clue
what happened to Mr. Blue?

983
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,786
Either he's alive, or he's dead,

984
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,373
or the cops got him, or they don't.

985
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,712
I take it this is the bastard
you told me about?

986
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,213
Why you beating on him?

987
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,300
Maybe he can tell us
who the fuck set us up.

988
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,302
If you fucking
beat this prick long enough,

989
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,721
he'll tell you he started
the goddamn Chicago fire.

990
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,432
Now, that don't necessarily
make it fucking so!

991
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,726
Come on, man, think!

992
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:42,062
All right! First things fucking last.

993
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,314
Who's got the stones?

994
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:47,109
Please, somebody at least tell me
one little fucking favor just for my sake.

995
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,403
I got a bag. I got a bag, okay?

996
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:52,531
I stashed it till I could be sure
this place wasn't a police station.

997
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,950
Good for you. Now, let's go get it.

998
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,834
First, we gotta get rid
of those cars outside.

999
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,746
Looks like Sam's hot car lot out there.

1000
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:03,334
Okay. Blondie, stay here
and babysit them two.

1001
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:07,087
White and pink, take a car each.

1002
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:10,049
I'll follow you. You ditch 'em.
We'll pick up the stones.

1003
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,011
While I'm following you, I'll arrange
some sort of a doctor for our friend.

1004
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,888
We can't leave these guys here with him.

1005
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:19,433
- Why not?
- 'Cause he's a fucking psycho.

1006
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:22,853
And if you think Joe's pissed off,

1007
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:25,773
that ain't nothing compared
to how pissed off I am at him

1008
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,067
for putting me in the same room
as that bastard!

1009
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,655
You see what I've been
putting up with, Eddie?

1010
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:37,743
I fucking walked in here,
I told these guys about staying put,

1011
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:41,038
Mr. White whips out his gun,
he's sticking it in my face,

1012
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,833
calling me a motherfucker,
saying he's gonna blow me away,

1013
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:47,127
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1014
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,838
He's the reason the joint
turned into a shooting spree.

1015
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,468
What are you, a fucking silent partner?
Tell him!

1016
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,721
He went crazy in the store,
but he seems all right now.

1017
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,057
This is what he was doing.

1018
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,851
Bam! Bam!

1019
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:05,521
Bam! Bam!

1020
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,439
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

1021
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,484
I told them not to touch
the fucking alarm, they did!

1022
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:14,321
If they hadn't done
what I told them not to do,

1023
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,698
they'd still be alive.

1024
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,076
My fucking hero.

1025
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:22,413
Thanks.

1026
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,083
That's your excuse for going
on a kill-crazy rampage?

1027
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:28,252
I don't like alarms, Mr. White.

1028
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,008
What does it matter
who stays with the cop?

1029
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,385
We ain't letting him go,
not after he's seen everybody.

1030
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,387
I haven't been looking at you guys.

1031
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,180
Shut the fuck up, man!

1032
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,743
You guys should never have taken him
out of the trunk in the first place.

1033
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,870
We've been trying to find out
what he knew about the setup.

1034
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,022
There is no fucking setup!

1035
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,815
Now, here's the news!

1036
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,526
Blondie, you stay here,
take care of these two.

1037
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:54,737
White and pink, you come with me,

1038
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,531
'cause if Joe gets here
and he sees all these cars parked outside,

1039
00:51:57,615 --> 00:52:00,618
I swear, he's gonna be just as mad at me
as he is at you.

1040
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,119
Fine, let's go.

1041
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,184
Alone at last.

1042
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,248
Guess what.

1043
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,251
I think I'm parked in a red zone.

1044
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:59,176
Now, where were we?

1045
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:04,515
I told you I don't know anything
about any fucking setup.

1046
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:05,683
Mm-hmm.

1047
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,352
I've been on the force
for only eight months.

1048
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,062
They don't tell me anything.

1049
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:15,192
Nobody tells me shit.
You can torture me all you want.

1050
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,821
Torture you. That's a good...
That's a good idea.

1051
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,531
I like that one. Yeah.

1052
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:25,285
- —Sounds fun.
- Even your boss said there wasn't a setup.

1053
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,539
My what?

1054
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,873
Your boss.

1055
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,459
Excuse me, pal.

1056
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,837
One thing I want to make clear to you.

1057
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,463
I don't have a boss.

1058
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,966
Nobody tells me what to do.

1059
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,051
You understand?

1060
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:43,011
You hear what I said, you son of a bitch?

1061
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:46,140
All right, all right, all right.
You don't have a boss. All right.

1062
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,186
Get that fucking shit off.

1063
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,239
Look, kid, I'm not gonna
bullshit you, okay?

1064
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:07,119
I don't really give a good fuck
what you know or don't know.

1065
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,914
But I'm gonna torture you anyway...

1066
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,752
Regardless.

1067
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,211
Not to get information.

1068
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:23,260
It's amusing to me to torture a cop.

1069
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:26,221
You can say anything you want
'cause I've heard it all before.

1070
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,144
All you can do is pray for a quick death...

1071
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:36,607
Which...

1072
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,735
You ain't gonna get.

1073
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,710
Oh, god.

1074
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:09,097
You ever listen to k-Billy's
super sounds of the '703?

1075
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,728
It's my personal favorite.

1076
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:23,821
Joe egan
and Gerry Rafferty were a duo

1077
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:25,906
known as stealers wheel

1078
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:30,160
when they recorded this dylanesque,
pop-bubblegum favorite

1079
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:32,704
from April of 1974.

1080
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,915
That reached up to number five,

1081
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,669
as k-bi/iy's super sounds of the '708
continues.

1082
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:57,437
J“ well, I don't know
why I came here tonight j“

1083
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:01,275
j“ I got the feeling
that somethin' ain't right j“

1084
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:05,070
j“ I'm so scared
in case I fall off my chair j“

1085
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:08,699
j“ and I'm wonderin'
how I'll get down the stairs j“

1086
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,368
J“ clowns to the left of me j“

1087
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,870
j“ jokers to the right j“

1088
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:16,164
j“ here I am
stuck in the middle with you j“

1089
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:20,669
j“ yes, I'm stuck in the middle
with you j“ -

1090
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,755
J“ and I'm wonderin'
what it is I should do j“

1091
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,842
j“ it's so hard to keep this smile
from my face j“

1092
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,928
Hold still.

1093
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:31,722
Hold still, you fuck!

1094
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,600
J“ clowns to the left of me j“

1095
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:36,101
j“ jokers to the right j“

1096
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:39,521
j“ here I am
stuck in the middle with you j“

1097
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,024
j“ well, you started off with nothin' j“

1098
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:45,360
j“ and you're proud
that you're a self-made man j“

1099
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:50,115
J“ and your friends
they all come crawlin' j“

1100
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,492
j“ slap you on the back
and say please j“

1101
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,870
was that as good for you as it was for me?

1102
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,664
- Hey, what's going on?
- J“ please j“

1103
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:00,375
you hear that?

1104
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:11,529
-J“ tryin' to make some sense of it all j“
-don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

1105
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:15,307
J“ but I can see it
makes no sense at all j“

1106
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,477
j“ is it cool
to go to sleep on the floor? J“

1107
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:22,356
j“ 'cause I don't think
that I can take any more j“

1108
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,400
j“ clowns to the left of me j“

1109
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:26,944
j“ jokers to the right j“

1110
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:29,446
j“ here I am, stuck in the middle... j“

1111
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,820
J“ please j“

1112
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,907
j“ please j“

1113
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,835
J“ well, I don't know
why I came here tonight j“

1114
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,714
j“ I got the feeling
that somethin' ain't right j“

1115
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:33,135
j“ I'm so scared
in case I fall off my chair j“

1116
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:36,763
j“ and I'm wonderin'
how I'll get down the stairs j“

1117
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,317
j“ clowns to the left of me j“

1118
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:40,976
J“ jokers to the right j“

1119
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:44,229
j“ here I am
stuck in the middle with you j“

1120
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:48,358
j“ yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you j“

1121
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,612
j“ stuck in the middle with you j“

1122
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:54,573
J“ here I am
stuck in the middle with you j“

1123
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,825
aah! Aah! Don't!

1124
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:59,202
Stop! Stop!

1125
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:02,039
- —Stop. Don't.
- What? What's the matter?

1126
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:03,457
Don't do this!

1127
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,043
- Please! Don't!
- That... that burn a little bit?

1128
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:08,420
Just stop! Stop!

1129
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,259
Please. Stop. Just stop.

1130
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,510
Stop... just talk to me.

1131
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:19,222
Please, don't. Please, don't...
Don't burn me, please!

1132
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:22,476
Ah! Ah!

1133
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,271
I'm begging you. I... I don't know anything
about any of you fucking guys!

1134
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,898
I'm not gonna say anything.

1135
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:31,485
Don't! Don't! Don't! Please don't!

1136
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,237
- You all through? You all through?
- Don't! Stop!

1137
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:37,824
Please, look, I got a little kid
at home now, please.

1138
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,285
- You all done?
- Don't!

1139
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,608
- Have some fire, scarecrow.
- Don't! Don't! Wait, don't!

1140
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,306
Fuck!

1141
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,684
Hey.

1142
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,644
Ah, shit.

1143
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:51,189
Hey, you.

1144
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,485
What's your name?

1145
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:00,824
Marvin.

1146
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,244
Marvin what?

1147
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,875
Marvin Nash.

1148
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:18,383
Listen to me, Marvin. I'm a...

1149
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:23,471
Listen to me, Marvin Nash. I'm a cop.

1150
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:27,392
Yeah, I know.

1151
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:31,563
You do?

1152
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:36,234
Yeah, your name's Freddy something.

1153
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,612
Newandyke.

1154
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,907
Freddy newandyke.

1155
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:51,541
Frankie ferchetti, he introduced us
about five months ago.

1156
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,963
Shit, I don't remember that at all.

1157
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:01,927
I do.

1158
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:04,638
Fuck.

1159
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:06,848
Freddy.

1160
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,268
Freddy.

1161
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,437
Freddy.

1162
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,734
How do I look?

1163
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,780
What?

1164
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:25,533
What?

1165
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,082
I don't know what to tell you, Marvin.

1166
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:37,921
That fuck.

1167
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:43,051
Ah, that sick fuck!

1168
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:46,763
That fucking bastard!

1169
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,975
Marvin, I need you to hold on.

1170
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,145
There's cops waiting to move in
a block away.

1171
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,899
What the fuck are they waiting for?

1172
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,861
This fucking guy slashes my face,

1173
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,406
and he cuts my fucking ear off!

1174
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,616
I'm fucking deformed!

1175
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,368
Fuck you!

1176
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:11,538
Fuck you! I'm fucking dying here!

1177
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,873
I'm fucking dying!

1178
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,510
They're not to make a move
till Joe cabot shows up.

1179
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,096
I was sent in to get him.

1180
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:30,890
All right?

1181
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:33,935
Now you heard 'em.
They said he's on his way.

1182
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:36,104
Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin.

1183
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,650
We're just gonna sit here and bleed

1184
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:43,570
till Joe cabot sticks his fucking head
through that door.

1185
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,052
Say hello to a motherfucker who's inside.

1186
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:10,055
Cabot's doing a job, and take a big,
fat guess who he wants on the team.

1187
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:12,599
This better not be
some kind of freddyjoke, man.

1188
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,351
This ain't no joke.

1189
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,353
I'm in there. I'm up his ass.

1190
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,863
Nice guy Eddie tells me
Joe wants to meet me.

1191
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,991
He says I should just hang in my apartment
and wait for a phone call.

1192
01:04:31,076 --> 01:04:33,328
After waiting three goddamn days
by the fucking phone,

1193
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,330
he calls me last night
and says Joe's ready,

1194
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,082
he'll pick me up in 15 minutes.

1195
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:38,416
Who all picked you up?

1196
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,293
Nice guy. We get to a bar.

1197
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,712
- What bar?
- —smokey Pete's in gardena.

1198
01:04:42,796 --> 01:04:44,339
- Mm-hmm.
- We get there,

1199
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:47,300
and I meet Joe and a guy named Mr. White.

1200
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,427
It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.

1201
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:50,929
Mr. Orange?

1202
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:52,263
Mr. Orange.

1203
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,433
Okay, Mr. Orange...

1204
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,161
Have you ever seen
this motherfucker before?

1205
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,187
Who? Mr. White?

1206
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,897
Yes, Mr. Orange, Mr. White.

1207
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,857
No, he ain't familiar.

1208
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:05,068
He, uh, ain't one
of cabot's soldiers either.

1209
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,528
He's gotta be from out of town.

1210
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:08,780
- Joe knows him real good.
- How can you tell?

1211
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,825
The way they talk to each other.
You can tell they're real buddies.

1212
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,035
- The two of you talk?
- Who, me and Joe?

1213
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,121
Mr. White.

1214
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:17,997
- A little.
- About what?

1215
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,375
- Brewers.
- Milwaukee brewers.

1216
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:22,419
Yeah. Apparently,
they won the night before.

1217
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,438
- He made a killing off 'em.
- This is sweet, man.

1218
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:27,924
If this crook's a brewers fan,
his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin.

1219
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,551
- Bing!
- And I'll bet you everything

1220
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,469
from a diddle-eyed Joe
to a damned-if-i-know

1221
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:34,472
that in Milwaukee they got a sheet
on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass.

1222
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,391
So what I want you to do

1223
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,893
is to go through the mugs
of all the guys from oi' Milwaukee

1224
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:40,520
with a history of armed robbery,

1225
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,313
put a name to the face.

1226
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:43,731
Nice work there.

1227
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:45,567
Thank you, my man.

1228
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,444
How was long beach Mike's referral?

1229
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:50,363
Perfecto. He's backing me up
a long fucking way.

1230
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,991
I told 'em it was long beach Mike
I did the poker game with.

1231
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,952
When nice guy called him to check it out,
he said it was a-ok.

1232
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,954
He said I was a good thief.

1233
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,832
I didn't rattle.
I was ready to make a move.

1234
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:04,169
Do right by him. He's a good guy.
I wouldn't be inside if it wasn't for him.

1235
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,212
No, no, no, no, no.

1236
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,673
Long beach Mike is not
your fucking amigo, man.

1237
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:11,092
Long beach Mike is a fucking scumbag.

1238
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,969
He's selling out his amigos.

1239
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:15,763
That's what kind of a nice guy
he fucking is, all right?

1240
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:17,324
I'll take care of his fucking ass, man,

1241
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,642
but you get that lowlife scumbag
out of mind

1242
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,811
and you take care of business,
you hear me?

1243
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:23,104
Gone.

1244
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:30,653
You use the commode story?

1245
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:32,906
What's the commode story?

1246
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,741
It's a scene, man. Memorize it.

1247
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:37,452
A what?

1248
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:39,996
Look, man, an undercover cop's
gotta be Marlon Brando, right?

1249
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,248
To do this job,
you gotta be a great actor.

1250
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:45,877
You gotta be naturalistic.
You gotta be naturalistic as hell.

1251
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,213
Because if you ain't a great actor,
you're a bad actor,

1252
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:50,215
and bad acting is bullshit in this job.

1253
01:06:50,298 --> 01:06:52,383
Yeah. What is this?

1254
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:54,886
That's an amusing anecdote
about a drug deal.

1255
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:57,639
What?

1256
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:00,701
Something funny that happened to you
while you were doing a fucking job, man.

1257
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:01,976
Damn.

1258
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,895
I gotta memorize all this?

1259
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,698
That's over four fucking pages
of this shit!

1260
01:07:05,772 --> 01:07:08,024
Just think about it
like it's a... a joke, all right?

1261
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:11,528
You memorize what's important,
the rest you make your own, all right?

1262
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:14,489
- You can tell a joke, can't you?
- No.

1263
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:18,368
Pretend you're Don rickles
or some-fucking-body and tell a joke.

1264
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,037
Now, the things
you gotta remember are the details.

1265
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,289
It's the details that sell your story.

1266
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:26,417
This particular story takes place
in a men's room.

1267
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:29,170
So you gotta know all the details
about the men's room.

1268
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:33,091
You gotta know if they got paper towels
or a blower to dry your hands with.

1269
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:36,719
You gotta know if the stalls
ain't got no doors or not, man.

1270
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,555
You gotta know if they got liquid soap

1271
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:41,975
or that pink granulated powdered shit
they used to use in high school, remember?

1272
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,852
You gotta know if they got
hot water or not, if it stinks,

1273
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:48,481
if some nasty, lowlife,
scum-ridden motherfucker, man,

1274
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,858
sprayed diarrhea
all over one of the bowls.

1275
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:54,404
You gotta know every detail
there is to know about this commode.

1276
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:57,740
What you gotta do
is take all them details, man,

1277
01:07:57,824 --> 01:07:59,325
and make them your own.

1278
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:00,827
While you're doing that,

1279
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,246
you gotta remember
that this story is about you,

1280
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,665
and how you perceived the events
that went down.

1281
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,543
The only way to do that, my brother...

1282
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:10,920
Keep saying it,

1283
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,382
and saying it and saying it
and saying it and saying it.

1284
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:21,764
This was during
the Los Angeles marijuana drought in 1986.

1285
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,642
I still had a connection,
which was insane,

1286
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:28,021
'cause you couldn't get
any weed any-fucking-where.

1287
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:30,857
Anyway...

1288
01:08:31,566 --> 01:08:33,836
I had a connection with this hippie chick
up in Santa Cruz

1289
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,528
and all my friends knew it.

1290
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:38,239
They'd give me a call and they'd say,
"hey, Freddy..."

1291
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:44,287
They'd say, "hey, dude, you getting some?

1292
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,707
Can you get some for me too?"
Like, they knew I still smoked,

1293
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,543
so they asked me to buy some for them
when I was buying for me.

1294
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:52,587
But it got to be...

1295
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,673
Got to be, got to be...

1296
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,426
Got to be...

1297
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,303
Every time I bought some weed,

1298
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:02,847
I was buying for four or five
different fucking people.

1299
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,558
Finally, I said, "fuck this shit.

1300
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:07,644
I'm making this bitch rich."

1301
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:11,105
She didn't have to do Jack shit.
She never even had to meet these people.

1302
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:12,940
I was doing all the work.

1303
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:15,026
But then that got to be a pain in the ass.

1304
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,362
People called me on the phone
all the fucking time.

1305
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:20,948
I couldn't even rent a fucking tape
without six phone calls interrupting me.

1306
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:23,284
"Hey, when's the next time
you're getting some?"

1307
01:09:23,368 --> 01:09:26,079
"Motherfucker! I'm trying
to watch the lost boys.

1308
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,790
When I get some, I'll let you know."

1309
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,167
Then these rinky-dink potheads come by...

1310
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,878
They're my friends and everything,
but still, you know?

1311
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:35,963
I got all my shit laid out in $60 bags.

1312
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:38,383
They don't want $60 worth.
They want $10 worth.

1313
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:40,718
Breaking it up is a major
fucking pain in the ass.

1314
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:44,389
I don't even know
what $10 worth looks like.

1315
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:46,724
This is a very weird situation.

1316
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:52,563
I don't know if you remember back in '86
there was a major fucking drought.

1317
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:53,981
Nobody had anything.

1318
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:57,402
People were living on resin, smoking
the wood in their pipes for months.

1319
01:09:57,485 --> 01:10:00,905
This chick had a bunch,
and she's begging me to sell it.

1320
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,283
So I told her, I wasn't
gonna be Joe the pot man anymore,

1321
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:08,371
but I would take a little bit and sell it
to my close, close, close friends.

1322
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:11,094
She agreed to that, said we'd keep
the same arrangement as before—-

1323
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:15,086
10% free pot for me
as long as I helped her out that weekend.

1324
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:18,297
She had a brick of weed she was selling,
she didn't wanna go to the buy alone.

1325
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:22,051
Her brother usually goes with her,
but he's in county unexpectedly.

1326
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:25,012
- What for?
- His traffic ticket's got a warrant.

1327
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:28,099
They stopped him for something,
found warrants on him, took him to county.

1328
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:31,894
Now, she doesn't wanna walk around alone
with all that weed.

1329
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:35,732
I don't want to do this.
I have a very bad feeling about it.

1330
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:38,151
She keeps asking me,
keeps asking me, keeps asking me.

1331
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:40,274
Finally, I said okay.
'Cause I'm sick of hearing it.

1332
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,072
Now we're picking the guy up
at the train station...

1333
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:46,159
You go to the train station to pick up
the buyer with the weed on you?

1334
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,453
The guy needed it right away.
Don't ask me why.

1335
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:52,498
Anyway, we get to the train station
and we're waiting for the guy.

1336
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:55,501
Now, I'm carrying the weed around
in one of those little carry-on bags.

1337
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:56,878
I gotta take a piss.

1338
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,681
So I tell the connection
I'll be right back,

1339
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,256
I'm going to the boys' room.

1340
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:07,180
So I walk in the men's room,
and who's standing there?

1341
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:12,435
Four Los Angeles county sheriffs
and a German Shepherd.

1342
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:15,897
They're waiting for you?

1343
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:18,333
No, it's just a bunch of cops
hanging out in the men's room, talking.

1344
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:19,942
When I walked through the door,

1345
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:22,528
they all stopped what they were
talking about and looked at me.

1346
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:26,866
That's hard, man.
That's a fucking hard situation.

1347
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:29,462
German Shepherd starts barking.

1348
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,705
He's barking at me.

1349
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:35,374
I mean, it's obvious. He's barking at me.

1350
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,419
Every nerve ending, all my senses,

1351
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:41,130
blood in my veins,
everything I have is screaming,

1352
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:45,134
"take off, man! Just bail!
Just get the fuck out of there!"

1353
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:46,698
Panic hits me like a bucket of water.

1354
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:49,263
First, there's the shock of it.
Bam, right in the face.

1355
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:51,224
I'm just standing there,
drenched in panic,

1356
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:54,435
and all these sheriffs are looking at me,
and they know, man.

1357
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:57,939
They can smell it,
sure as that fucking dog can.

1358
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,774
They can smell it on me.

1359
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:01,818
Shut up!

1360
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,154
So... so anyway...

1361
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:06,864
I got my gun drawn, right?

1362
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:08,508
And I got it pointed right at this guy,

1363
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:12,203
and I tell him, "freeze!
Don't fucking move!"

1364
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:14,247
And this little idiot's
looking right at me,

1365
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,250
nodding his head yeah,
and he's saying, "I know. I know. I know."

1366
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,670
But meanwhile, his right hand
is creeping towards the glove box.

1367
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,004
And I scream at him, I go,

1368
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:25,716
"asshole! I'm gonna
fucking blow you away right now!

1369
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,260
Put your hands on the dash!"

1370
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,470
And he's still looking at me,

1371
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:33,266
nodding his head, you know...
"I know, buddy. I know. I know."

1372
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:36,644
And meanwhile, you know,
his hand is still going for the glove box.

1373
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:42,942
And I said, "buddy,
I'm gonna shoot you in the face

1374
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:45,528
if you don't put your hands
on the fucking dash!"

1375
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:51,158
And then this guy's girlfriend,
this real sexy oriental bitch, you know,

1376
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:54,412
she starts screaming at him,
"Chuck! Chuck! What are you doing?

1377
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:56,998
Listen to the officer!
Put your hands on the dash!"

1378
01:12:57,832 --> 01:13:00,293
So, you know, then like nothing,
the guy snaps out of it

1379
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,169
and casually puts his hands on the dash.

1380
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:03,573
What was he going for?

1381
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,548
His fucking registration.

1382
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:08,175
You're kidding!

1383
01:13:08,259 --> 01:13:09,903
No, man! Stupid fucking citizen

1384
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:12,513
doesn't know how close he came
to getting blown away.

1385
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:14,765
That close, man.

1386
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:47,858
Bonehead running around
the neighborhood. Police brutality.

1387
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:49,568
You knew
how to handle that situation.

1388
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:52,470
Just shit your pants and dive in and swim.

1389
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,308
Tell me more about cabot.

1390
01:13:57,391 --> 01:13:58,976
I don't know.

1391
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,854
He's... he's a cool guy, you know.

1392
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,483
He's funny. He's a funny guy.

1393
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,361
You remember the fantastic four?

1394
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:13,407
Oh, yeah, with that, uh, invisible bitch
and, uh, "flame on" and shit.

1395
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:15,910
The thing.

1396
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:20,247
Motherfucker looks just like the thing.

1397
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,669
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1398
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:26,712
Showtime.

1399
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,130
Grab your jacket.

1400
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:29,632
I'm parked outside.

1401
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,008
I'll be right down.

1402
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:34,345
He'll be right down.

1403
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:37,056
J“ my sunshine j“

1404
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:40,601
j“ the part he always liked the best j“

1405
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:43,270
j“ when she'd tease him with a kiss j“

1406
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:48,943
j“ and she said, "you make me happy" j“

1407
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:53,239
j“ be a fool for love j“

1408
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:59,704
j“ what he wouldn't do for love j“

1409
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:04,667
j“ he's a fool, a fool for love j“

1410
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:11,716
j“ born a fool
you got to follow the rule j“

1411
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:14,051
j“ always a fool... j“

1412
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,843
Don't pussy out on me now.

1413
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:57,887
They don't know.

1414
01:15:58,512 --> 01:15:59,930
They don't know shit.

1415
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:02,349
You're not gonna get hurt.

1416
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:04,060
You're fucking baretta.

1417
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:06,979
They believe every fucking word
'cause you're super cool.

1418
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,238
There goes our boy.

1419
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:18,550
I swear, the guy
has to have rocks in his head

1420
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,910
the size of Gibraltar to work undercover.

1421
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:23,754
- —You want one of these?
- Yeah. Give me the bear claw.

1422
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,959
J“ ooga-chaka, ooga-ooga j“

1423
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:31,045
j“ ooga-chaka, ooga-ooga j“

1424
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,130
j“ ooga-chaka, ooga-ooga j“

1425
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:35,216
j“ ooga-chaka, ooga-ooga j“

1426
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:38,094
j“ I can't stop this feeling j“

1427
01:16:38,177 --> 01:16:40,304
-j“ ooga-ooga j“
-j“ deep inside of me j“

1428
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,056
hey, I know what I'm talking about, okay?

1429
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:44,809
Black women ain't the same as white women.

1430
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:46,268
There's a slight difference.

1431
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:49,063
Very funny. You know what I mean.

1432
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:50,606
What a white bitch will put up with,

1433
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,709
a black bitch wouldn't put up with
for a minute, man.

1434
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:55,569
They got a line and if you cross it,
they fuck you up.

1435
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:58,114
I gotta go along with pink on that one.
I've seen it happen.

1436
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:01,033
Okay, Mr. Expert,
if this is such a truism,

1437
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:04,995
why is it that every nigger I know
treats his woman like a piece of shit?

1438
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:07,456
I'll make you a bet
that those same damn niggers

1439
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,333
who were showin' their ass in public,

1440
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:12,086
when their bitches get them home, man,
they chill the fuck out.

1441
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:14,797
- Not these guys.
- Oh, yeah, those guys, too.

1442
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:16,841
Tell you guys a story.

1443
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:19,176
One of daddy's clubs,

1444
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:22,263
there's a black cocktail waitress
named elois.

1445
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:24,515
- Elois?
- Yeah, elois.

1446
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,684
E and Lois.

1447
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,018
We called her lady e.

1448
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:32,022
[Where was she from, Compton?
Uaughs]

1449
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:33,482
She's from ladera heights.

1450
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,860
Well, ladera heights,
that's the black Beverly Hills.

1451
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:39,446
Well, it's not the black Beverly Hills.

1452
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:42,116
It's the black palos verdes.

1453
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:44,910
Anyway, lady e...

1454
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:48,497
I mean, she was a man-eater-upper.
UN-fucking-believable.

1455
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:50,875
Every guy that ever,
ever laid his eyes on her

1456
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:53,252
had to Jack off to her at least once.

1457
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:56,755
You know who she looked like?
She looked like christie love.

1458
01:17:56,839 --> 01:18:00,593
Remember that TV show get christie lovel,
about the black female cop?

1459
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:01,719
She always used to say,

1460
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:03,637
"You're under arrest, sugar."

1461
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:07,933
What's the name of the chick
who played christie love?

1462
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,102
- Pam grier.
- No, it wasn't Pam grier.

1463
01:18:10,186 --> 01:18:11,896
Pam grier was the other one.

1464
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:13,606
Pam grier did the film.

1465
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:18,402
Christie love was like a Pam grier TV show
without Pam grier.

1466
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,988
- —So who was christie love?
- How the fuck should I know?

1467
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:23,616
Great, now I'm totally fucking tortured.

1468
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,994
Whoever it was, it doesn't matter.
She looked exactly like elois.

1469
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:28,495
Anne Francis.

1470
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:31,248
No, that was honey west.

1471
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:33,083
- Anne Francis is white.
- Shut up.

1472
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:35,085
All right,
I'm trying to tell a story here.

1473
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:37,463
She looked exactly like elois.

1474
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:40,049
Anyway, I come into the club one night.

1475
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:43,636
There's Carlos, he's the bartender.
He's a wetback. He's a friend of mine.

1476
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:48,390
And I says to him,
"Carlos, where's lady e tonight?"

1477
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:52,937
And he... now, apparently, lady e
was married to a real piece of dog shit.

1478
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,438
I mean, a real fucking animal.

1479
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:56,917
- He used to do things to her.
- Do things... do things.

1480
01:18:56,941 --> 01:19:00,611
Like what? What would he do?
He beat her up or something?

1481
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,822
I don't know what he did.
He just did things, all right?

1482
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:07,368
So, anyway, one night,
she plays it real cool.

1483
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,703
She waits for this bag of shit
to get drunk.

1484
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:12,539
He falls asleep on the fucking couch.

1485
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:17,127
She sneaks up on him,
she puts some wacko glue on his dick,

1486
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:19,338
- —and glues his dick to his belly.
- Ohh!

1487
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,299
- No.
- Jesus Christ.

1488
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:25,219
I'm serious, man.
I'm serious. I'm dead serious.

1489
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:28,264
They had to call the paramedics
to cut the prick loose, literally.

1490
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:29,950
Do some crazy things with it.

1491
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:31,392
Was he all pissed off?

1492
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:36,146
How would you feel
if every time you had to take a piss,

1493
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,274
you had to do a fucking handstand?

1494
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:46,240
You guys like to tell jokes and giggle
and kid around, huh?

1495
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:49,410
Giggling like a bunch of young broads
in the schoolyard.

1496
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:51,203
Well, let me tell a joke.

1497
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:56,166
Five guys sitting in a bullpen,
San Quentin,

1498
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,044
wondering how the fuck they got there.

1499
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,089
"What did we do wrong?
What should have we done?

1500
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:05,342
What didn't we do?
It's your fault, my fault, his fault."

1501
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:06,677
All that bullshit.

1502
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:09,013
Finally, someone comes up with the idea.

1503
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:10,306
"Wait a minute.

1504
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:13,350
While we were planning this caper,

1505
01:20:13,434 --> 01:20:15,978
all we did was sit around
and tell fucking jokes."

1506
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:17,688
Got the message?

1507
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:21,775
Fellas, I don't mean to holler at you.

1508
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:26,613
When this caper's over, and I'm sure
it's gonna be a successful one,

1509
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:30,117
hell, we'll go down the Hawaiian islands,
I'll roar and laugh with all of you.

1510
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,202
You'll find me a different character
down there.

1511
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,496
Right now, it's a matter of business.

1512
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:39,918
With the exception of Eddie and myself,
whom you already know,

1513
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:42,921
we're gonna be using aliases on this job.

1514
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:47,301
Under no circumstances
do I want any one of you

1515
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:50,387
to relate to each other
by your Christian names,

1516
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:55,434
and I don't want any talk
about yourself personally.

1517
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:59,480
That includes where you been,
your wife's name,

1518
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:01,440
where you might have done time,

1519
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:04,735
or a bank maybe you robbed
in St. Petersburg.

1520
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:08,614
All I want you guys to talk about,
if you have to,

1521
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:11,492
is what you're gonna do.

1522
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:13,619
That should do it.

1523
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:15,913
Here are your names.

1524
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,207
Mr. Brown,

1525
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:19,792
Mr. White,

1526
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,460
Mr. Blonde,

1527
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,462
Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange,

1528
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,588
and Mr. Pink.

1529
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:26,131
Why am I Mr. Pink?

1530
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,300
Because you're a faggot, all right?

1531
01:21:30,344 --> 01:21:31,929
Why can't we pick our own colors?

1532
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:35,224
No way. No way.
Tried it once. It doesn't work.

1533
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:38,811
You get four guys all fighting over
who's gonna be Mr. Black.

1534
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,480
They don't know each other,
so nobody wants to back down.

1535
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,691
No way. I pick. You're Mr. Pink.

1536
01:21:44,775 --> 01:21:47,319
Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.

1537
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:50,447
Yeah, but Mr. Brown,
that's a little too close to Mr. Shit.

1538
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:52,366
Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy.

1539
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:54,284
How about if I'm Mr. Purple?

1540
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:56,370
That sounds good to me.
I'll be Mr. Purple.

1541
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:58,080
You're not Mr. Purple.

1542
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,583
Some guy on some otherjob is Mr. Purple.

1543
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:03,210
You're Mr. Pink!

1544
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,045
Who cares what your name is?

1545
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:06,630
Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

1546
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:08,882
You're Mr. White.
You have a cool-sounding name.

1547
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:11,718
All right, look, if it's no big deal
to be Mr. Pink, you wanna trade?

1548
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:14,763
Hey, nobody's trading with anybody.

1549
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:18,600
This ain't a goddamn fucking
city council meeting, you know.

1550
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:22,396
Now listen up, Mr. Pink.

1551
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:24,898
There's two ways you can go on this job:

1552
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:27,401
My way or the highway.

1553
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,486
Now, what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

1554
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,531
Jesus Christ, Joe.
Fucking forget about it.

1555
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:35,909
It's beneath me, you know.
I'm Mr. Pink. Let's move on.

1556
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:38,954
I'll move on when I feel like it.

1557
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:41,665
All you guys got the goddamn message?

1558
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:46,753
I'm so goddamn mad hollering at you guys,
I can hardly talk.

1559
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:50,299
Let's go to work.

1560
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:53,719
Let's go over it. Where are you?

1561
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:55,613
I stand outside
and guard the door.

1562
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,556
I don't let anybody go in or go out.

1563
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:00,476
- Mr. Brown?
- Mr. Brown waits in the car.

1564
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:02,370
He's parked across the street
till I give him the signal.

1565
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:04,062
Then he pulls up in front of the store.

1566
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,398
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?

1567
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:09,109
Crowd control.
They handle customers and employees.

1568
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:11,570
That girl's ass?

1569
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,322
It's sitting right here on my dick.

1570
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:17,242
Myself and Mr. Pink?

1571
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:21,955
Uh, you two take the manager in the back
and make him give you the diamonds.

1572
01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:24,124
We're there for those stones, period.

1573
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:26,585
Since no display cases
are being fucked with,

1574
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:28,295
no alarms should go off.

1575
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:31,715
We're out of there in two minutes,
not one second longer.

1576
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:35,802
What happens if the manager
won't give you the diamonds?

1577
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:38,889
When you're dealing
with a store like this,

1578
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,807
they're insured up the ass.

1579
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:43,435
They're not supposed
to give you any resistance, whatsoever.

1580
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:47,439
If you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson,

1581
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:49,942
take the butt of your gun
and smash their nose in.

1582
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,735
Drops him right to the floor.

1583
01:23:51,818 --> 01:23:53,820
Everyone jumps, he falls down screaming.

1584
01:23:53,904 --> 01:23:56,490
Blood squirts out of his nose,
freaks everybody out.

1585
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:58,659
Nobody says fucking shit after that.

1586
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,954
You might get some bitch talk shit to you.

1587
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,831
Give her a look like you're gonna
smash her in the face next.

1588
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:07,251
Watch her shut the fuck up.

1589
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:09,336
Now, if it's a manager,
that's a different story.

1590
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:12,381
The managers know better
than to fuck around.

1591
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:14,633
So, if you get one
that's giving you static,

1592
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,260
he probably thinks he's a real cowboy,

1593
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:18,345
so you gotta break
that son of a bitch in two.

1594
01:24:19,096 --> 01:24:21,181
If you want to know something
and he won't tell you,

1595
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,725
cut off one of his fingers,
the little one.

1596
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:26,353
Then tell him his thumb's next.

1597
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:28,855
After that, he'll tell you
if he wears ladies' underwear.

1598
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:35,487
I'm hungry. Let's get a taco.

1599
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,875
Come on!

1600
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:50,836
Hey... I don't believe this.

1601
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:51,920
Fuck!

1602
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:03,890
Fuck!

1603
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:14,526
Jesus. I got blinded, man.
I'm fucking blind.

1604
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:17,029
You're not blind. You just got blood
in your eyes, all right?

1605
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:23,075
Aah!

1606
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:32,252
Is he dead?

1607
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:34,296
Did he die or not?

1608
01:25:36,006 --> 01:25:37,215
Let's go.

1609
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:14,461
Hold it! Hold it! Right there!

1610
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:18,006
Get out of the fucking car!

1611
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:36,108
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Larry.

1612
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,485
I... I can't believe she killed me!

1613
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:40,404
Who would've fucking thought that?

1614
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:43,115
Hey!
Just cancel that shit right now!

1615
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:47,202
You're hurt! You're hurt real fucking bad,
but you ain't dying!

1616
01:26:48,412 --> 01:26:52,582
Oh! All this blood
is scaring the shit out of me, Larry!

1617
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:55,335
I... I'm gonna die! I know it!

1618
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:33,206
- What the fuck happened?
- He slashed the cop's face.

1619
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:35,959
Cut off his ear
and was gonna burn him alive.

1620
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:38,837
What? I didn't hear you.

1621
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:40,839
I said...

1622
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:44,384
Blonde went crazy.

1623
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:48,972
He slashed the cop's face, cutoff his ear
and was gonna burn him alive.

1624
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:51,016
This cop?

1625
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,519
No.

1626
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:58,148
He went crazy? Something like that?

1627
01:27:58,231 --> 01:27:59,524
Worse or better?

1628
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:03,653
Eddie, he was pulling a burn, man.

1629
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,907
He was gonna kill the cop and me.

1630
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,825
When you guys walked through the door,

1631
01:28:08,909 --> 01:28:11,620
he was gonna blow you to hell
and make off with the diamonds.

1632
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:16,208
What'd I tell you? That sick piece of shit
was a stone-cold psycho.

1633
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:19,586
You could've asked the cop,
if you didn't just kill him.

1634
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:23,089
He talked about what he was gonna do
when he was slicing him up.

1635
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:27,844
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.

1636
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:34,726
Makes perfect fucking sense to me.

1637
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:38,313
You weren't there during the job, Eddie.
You didn't see how he acted. We did.

1638
01:28:38,396 --> 01:28:40,649
He's right about the ear. It's hacked off.

1639
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,859
All right, let me just say this out loud,

1640
01:28:42,943 --> 01:28:44,903
'cause I want to get this straight
in my head.

1641
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:49,032
You're saying that Mr. Blonde
was gonna kill you,

1642
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:52,285
and then when we got back,
he was gonna kill us,

1643
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:54,246
take the satchel of diamonds and scram.

1644
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,582
I'm right about that, right?
That's correct? That's your story?

1645
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:01,878
I swear on my mother's eternal soul,
it's what happened.

1646
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:05,757
The man you just killed
just got released from prison.

1647
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:08,969
He got caught at a company warehouse
full of hot items.

1648
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:10,762
He could have fucking walked.

1649
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:15,934
All he had to do was say my dad's name,
but he kept his fucking mouth shut.

1650
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:19,145
And he did his fucking time,
and he did it like a man.

1651
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:21,439
He did four years for us.

1652
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:23,191
So, Mr. Orange,

1653
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:26,278
you're telling me
this very good friend of mine,

1654
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:29,155
who did four years for my father,

1655
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:31,700
who, in four years, never made a deal,

1656
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,827
no matter what they dangled
in front of him,

1657
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:37,205
you're telling me that now
that this man is free

1658
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:40,333
and we're making good
on our commitment to him,

1659
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:43,336
he's just gonna decide,

1660
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:47,424
out of the fucking blue, to rip us off?

1661
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:52,804
Why don't you tell me
what really happened?

1662
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:54,347
What the hell for?

1663
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,392
It'd just be more bullshit.

1664
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:01,605
This man set us up.

1665
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:05,859
Dad, I'm sorry, but I don't know
what the hell's happening.

1666
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:07,527
It's all right, Eddie. I do.

1667
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,863
What the fuck are you talking about?

1668
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:13,617
That lump of shit's working with the LAPD.

1669
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:18,038
Joe, I don't have
the slightest fucking idea

1670
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:19,789
what you're talking about.

1671
01:30:19,873 --> 01:30:23,418
Joe, Joe, I don't know
what you think you know, but you're wrong.

1672
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,253
Like hell I am.

1673
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:27,881
Joe, trust me on this.
You've made a mistake.

1674
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:30,216
He's a good kid.

1675
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,844
I understand. You're hot.
You're super-fucking pissed.

1676
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,679
We're all real emotional.

1677
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:36,765
But you're barking up the wrong tree.

1678
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:40,644
- I know this man. He wouldn't do that.
- —You don't knowjack shit!

1679
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:41,978
I do!

1680
01:30:42,062 --> 01:30:46,107
The cocksucker tipped off the cops
and had Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.

1681
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:49,152
- Mr. Blue is dead?
- —Dead as Dillinger.

1682
01:30:49,235 --> 01:30:51,237
How do you know all this?

1683
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:53,657
He's the only one I wasn't 100% on.

1684
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:58,078
I should have my fucking head examined,
going ahead when I wasn't 100%.

1685
01:30:58,161 --> 01:30:59,245
That's your proof?

1686
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,331
You don't need proof
when you have instinct.

1687
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:04,292
I ignored it before, but no more.

1688
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:08,338
Have you lost your fucking mind?

1689
01:31:08,421 --> 01:31:11,883
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake.
I'm not gonna let you make it.

1690
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:14,761
Come on, guys. Nobody wants this.

1691
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:16,888
We're supposed to be
fucking professionals.

1692
01:31:17,722 --> 01:31:21,059
Larry, look,
it's been quite a long time,

1693
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:23,144
a lot ofjobs.

1694
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:25,480
There's no need for this, man.

1695
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:28,775
Let's just put our guns down,

1696
01:31:29,985 --> 01:31:33,363
and let's settle this
with a fucking conversation.

1697
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:36,157
Joe, if you kill that man, you die next.

1698
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:39,160
Repeat.
If you kill that man, you die next.

1699
01:31:39,244 --> 01:31:41,955
Larry, we have been friends,

1700
01:31:42,789 --> 01:31:44,582
and you respect my dad and I respect you,

1701
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,866
but I will put fucking bullets
right through your heart.

1702
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:49,129
You put that fucking gun down. Now.

1703
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:53,717
Goddamn you, Joe. Don't make me do this.

1704
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,428
Larry, stop pointing
that fucking gun at my dad!

1705
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:44,828
I'm sorry, kid.

1706
01:33:47,497 --> 01:33:49,249
Looks like we're gonna...

1707
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:52,168
Do... do a little time.

1708
01:33:59,259 --> 01:34:00,552
I'm a cop.

1709
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:04,222
Larry...

1710
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:07,851
I'm sorry.

1711
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:13,606
I'm s... so sorry.

1712
01:34:16,192 --> 01:34:19,821
I'm a cop.

1713
01:34:34,627 --> 01:34:36,880
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1714
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:50,977
I'm sorry, Larry!

1715
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:53,897
I'm... sorry.

1716
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:57,609
Larry, I'm sorry.

1717
01:34:57,692 --> 01:35:00,862
Freeze!
Drop the fucking gun, buddy!

1718
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:02,882
- Now!
- Put the gun down!

1719
01:35:02,906 --> 01:35:04,550
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun, man!

1720
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:06,993
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun! Drop the fucking gun!

1721
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:08,929
We're gonna
fucking blow you away!
