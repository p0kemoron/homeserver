1
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:47,605
Shit! Oh...

2
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:05,165
Shit, shit, shit! Ohh!

3
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:21,005
Police! Open up!

4
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:26,485
Come on. We know you're in there.

5
00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:30,245
Cleaver Greene?

6
00:01:30,405 --> 00:01:32,045
Yeah, you know who I am.

7
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:33,525
Sorry to bother you this late,

8
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:35,045
but we understand you reported

9
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:37,725
a child's bracelet
stolen some time back?

10
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:40,045
What are you talking about?

11
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:42,925
Silver-plated, semi-precious stones

12
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:46,285
and an “I love Justin Bieber”
love heart.

13
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:48,085
Very nice.
Yeah.

14
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:51,765
Not you?

15
00:01:51,925 --> 00:01:54,525
Oh, dear. Don't tell me —
this is the wrong place.

16
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:56,445
And at this time of night!
Mmm.

17
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:59,125
Nice shirt.

18
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:04,045
Come on, guys! We'll be late.

19
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:06,605
Darling, are you sure?
Yeah, it's fine. I can take them.

20
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:08,325
I don't have my first
appointment till 10:30.

21
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:10,165
‘Bye, Mum.
‘Bye!

22
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:13,005
I've got a million things
to do around here.

23
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:16,045
‘Bye, Mum!
‘Bye!

24
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:30,805
Rusty!

25
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:37,805
Ladies and gentlemen
of the board,

26
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:41,045
doubtless you would agree
that it is vitally important

27
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:45,125
that we confront the variables
of our current economic landscape

28
00:02:45,285 --> 00:02:47,365
and recalibrate our thinking

29
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:50,605
in terms of our client base
moving forward.

30
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:55,005
Excuse my emotion, Madam Chair,

31
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:58,605
but that for me —
and I hope for all of us —

32
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:01,005
was a genuine “wow” moment.

33
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:06,925
Let me pose this one
simple, clear question.

34
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:10,045
Are you as a company moving forward,

35
00:03:10,205 --> 00:03:12,725
as the engine room
of a greater organism,

36
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:15,925
genuinely embracing
and honouring the fundamentals

37
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:18,365
underpinning the goals expressed
in your mission statement?

38
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:20,925
Are you nurturing and cherishing

39
00:03:21,085 --> 00:03:24,045
your “ongoing commitment
to excellence at every level”

40
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:27,925
both in terms of your charter
and at your customer interface?

41
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:30,885
Because that is your mandate,
that is your remit,

42
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,885
that is your duty of care.

43
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:36,325
Outcome focus as a means
of achieving positive deliverables

44
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:38,365
within a realisable factual matrix...

45
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:41,645
Plus achieving
customer satisfaction targets.

46
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,965
Oh, KPIs.

47
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,325
Yes, yes, yes.

48
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:49,805
And isn't that another way
of saying it's about...

49
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:51,165
- Lawrence Fenton?
- Stop there!

50
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:52,965
..communication!

51
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,525
We're arresting you
on charges of trespass.

52
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:57,005
Look, can I just finish
making this point?

53
00:03:57,165 --> 00:03:59,325
It speaks directly
to their core values.

54
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:01,685
No, come with us.
What is the meaning of this?

55
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:04,605
This gentleman is a consultant.
He has every right to be here.

56
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:07,165
Oh, really? In what field
does he consult?

57
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:09,405
Oh, he is a leading...

58
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:11,845
..leading...

59
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:13,965
..consultant, hm?

60
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,445
So he was invited to the meeting?

61
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:17,845
Well, Russell asked him.
I did no such thing!

62
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:19,645
That's what we thought.
Come with us, please.

63
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:21,565
It's Audrey, isn't it?

64
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:25,925
I think I met you once before
at the Branman Energy AGM.

65
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:29,565
All these words have lost
their essential meaning.

66
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:31,925
That is what my protest is about.

67
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,885
Pick any of these words at random,
shove them in any order you like

68
00:04:35,045 --> 00:04:37,045
and they'll make just as much sense.

69
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:38,525
Off you go.

70
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:42,085
Read any government document,
listen to some corporate guru —

71
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:44,925
elaborate,
technical-sounding twaddle.

72
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,205
It was you who phoned us
about the Omnico meeting.

73
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:50,245
You said lives were
at stake, Lawrence.

74
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:53,525
They are. Our very civilisation
is at stake.

75
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:55,085
This is how the world will end —

76
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:56,565
not with a bang,

77
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:59,005
but with a diminished
verbal response capability.

78
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:02,805
That's how CIA agents
at Abu Ghraib described a whimper.

79
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:04,565
The Pentagon describes a plane crash

80
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:06,405
as “an unintentional flight
into the ground”.

81
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:08,005
This is what we've come to.

82
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:10,325
These people are robbing us
of meaning, you see,

83
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:11,885
and they have to be stopped.

84
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,525
You wanted to get caught
so this would come out in the press.

85
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,845
Now read that out without pause
as if it had some meaning.

86
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:22,565
Stress ‘only' and ‘consistent'.

87
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:28,725
“The uplift manifests only
when positional change occurs

88
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:32,325
“within the context of our deliverable
modular units

89
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:37,365
“consistent with our core
underpinning fundamentals.”

90
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:41,365
Oh, brilliant. Now just add
“moving forward” and you're set.

91
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:12,285
Yeah.
Oh, g'day, Cleave.

92
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:15,005
Way too long, mate.
Yeah.

93
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:17,765
High time we squeezed the nectar
out of a few grapes.

94
00:06:18,765 --> 00:06:20,605
Mmm?
Listen, mate.

95
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:22,965
I was wondering if you're
free for a spot of lunch.

96
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,805
I might be able to steer
some work your way.

97
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:28,565
Yes, today, mate.

98
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:32,165
See, this is the thing, Paul.

99
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,765
You've told me that I should be
less structured and more impulsive.

100
00:06:34,925 --> 00:06:35,925
Well, I...

101
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:38,525
“Make impulse
and spontaneity your mantra.”

102
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:41,165
OK, that's...
that's entirely my fault.

103
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:45,365
Um, but at the end of the day
it's about outcomes, isn't it?

104
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:47,365
What is it you want to achieve?

105
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:50,725
Uh, I want...

106
00:06:50,885 --> 00:06:55,165
I just want to make things right
for Barney and the children.

107
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,125
I want to make up for what I did.

108
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,405
Scarlet, you need to stop
punishing yourself

109
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:02,125
for your affair with Cleaver.

110
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:04,005
That's all in the past.

111
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:06,565
Isn't it, Barney?
Yeah.

112
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:08,445
Are you still seeing Cleaver at all?

113
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:10,725
No.

114
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:17,565
So, uh, tell me —
how's your special night going?

115
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,805
Um, we've decided...

116
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:25,525
..that we might try the role-play.

117
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:27,485
I'm a little nervous. I'm no actress.

118
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:29,525
Well, that...that was
merely a suggestion.

119
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:31,405
It's about having
a fun, relaxed time,

120
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:32,885
you know, being yourselves

121
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:36,805
and reconnecting with those original
feelings you had for each other.

122
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,565
What the hell is he doing here?!

123
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,805
Is this some sort of bad joke?

124
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:48,965
How marvellous
to see you too, Clover.

125
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,165
Ah, Cleave!

126
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:53,405
Come in, mate.
Not on the terrace.

127
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:55,645
I have Bridey and Geoff coming over.
Yeah, righto.

128
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:58,485
Jesus, Damien. I can't believe
you brought him to our home!

129
00:08:00,445 --> 00:08:03,125
Ignore the Clove, mate. Sorry.
I didn't think she'd be home.

130
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:05,325
She's still pissed about
you shagging our ex-premier.

131
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,805
Oh, yes.

132
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:09,365
Caused some real headaches
for the party.

133
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:13,405
You know, I once had sex
with the premier's sister

134
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:15,405
30,000 feet above Denpasar.

135
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:17,965
I take it you're a paid-up member
of the Mile High?

136
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,525
No, but I once had sex
in a portaloo, if that counts.

137
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:23,245
Where are we, exactly?

138
00:08:23,405 --> 00:08:25,685
This is my sanctuary, mate.

139
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:28,805
Yeah, I've got something
like this at my place.

140
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:32,085
I hope this isn't lunch, mate,
‘cause I haven't eaten.

141
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,165
Yeah, yeah, yeah, lunch.

142
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:38,365
Yes, yes, yes. You said...
you said lunch, actually.

143
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:42,845
I've been doing a bit
of pro bono financial work

144
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:44,445
for the kids' leukaemia foundation.

145
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:46,845
CFO by default.
It's one of Clover's little pets.

146
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:48,405
I said I'd help sort them out.

147
00:08:48,565 --> 00:08:50,805
Things have gone a bit pear-shaped

148
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:54,525
and, uh, I thought I'd employ
your smarts from the get-go.

149
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:56,085
I don't do commercial law, mate.

150
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,965
No, no, this is criminal.

151
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,445
OK.

152
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,965
Look, I borrowed a bit from
the foundation — purely as a loan.

153
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,045
I haven't had a chance
to pay it back yet.

154
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:05,685
I mean, I will. I guarantee that.

155
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,485
But they've called in
the forensic accountants

156
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:09,565
and I think...

157
00:09:10,565 --> 00:09:12,725
..there's a chance
I'll be wading in the brown stuff.

158
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:16,005
How much are we talking about?
Two mill.

159
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:17,885
Well, a smidge over,
but I'm good for it.

160
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:21,525
You stole $2 million from
a kids' leukaemia foundation?

161
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:24,685
It wasn't theft, mate. I had a couple
of investments go sour and...

162
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:26,245
Oh, yes, I can see those.

163
00:09:26,405 --> 00:09:28,525
And that bitch has me
spinning on a rotisserie.

164
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:32,125
She's given me an allowance,
a drip-feed from the family trust!

165
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:34,365
Do you know how
humiliating that is, mate?

166
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:36,685
Sorry, mate, I still
haven't moved on from

167
00:09:36,845 --> 00:09:39,845
you stole $2 million from
a kids' leukaemia foundation.

168
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:41,725
I don't mean to
editorialise here, mate,

169
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:43,965
but what sort of a man are you?

170
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,965
Look, I didn't fucking steal it.
It was a loan. I'll pay it back.

171
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,445
I got a plan.
Right.

172
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:49,925
By that, I take it you mean

173
00:09:50,085 --> 00:09:52,405
you hope a roughie comes in
at 20-to-1 at Randwick.

174
00:09:52,565 --> 00:09:54,445
I love it — you're all
this and that, aren't you?

175
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:56,525
Now, what's the play?
There's no play, mate!

176
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:59,445
You live in a fucking
$12 million mansion!

177
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:01,685
You steal from dying kids!

178
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:05,485
They haven't invented the words
to spin language to get you out of this.

179
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:07,605
You're in deep shit.
Shh!

180
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:13,365
Keep your
fucking voice down, mate.

181
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,045
You gotta help me out.

182
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:20,485
And I can pay you, but the wife
can't know, otherwise I'm fried.

183
00:10:20,645 --> 00:10:22,765
What's your advice?

184
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:31,925
Oh, how many times have I told you
to ring before you bowl up here...

185
00:10:32,085 --> 00:10:33,405
I rang, I rang.

186
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:34,885
There's a message on your phone

187
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:37,085
saying, “I'm in a taxi,
I'm coming to your place,

188
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:38,645
“I need your vacuum cleaner.”

189
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,525
Well, there's a sentence
I didn't expect to hear from you.

190
00:10:41,685 --> 00:10:43,885
You look shocking. Have you
had a party or something?

191
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:48,805
Yes, a party celebrating the return
of my Justin Bieber bracelet.

192
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:51,485
Have you got any food? I'm starving.

193
00:10:51,645 --> 00:10:53,205
Uh...

194
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:55,805
Fuzz in?

195
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:58,165
He is indeed.
He's studying, what's more.

196
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,965
He's not going out.
He jogs every afternoon.

197
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:05,165
Amazingly enough, he's not having sex
with any of his female teachers.

198
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:08,205
Ladies.
This is my book club.

199
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:11,165
Book club, ex-husband
on the way through.

200
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:13,285
Oh, you're in a book club.
How wonderful.

201
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:16,325
The vacuum cleaner's in the laundry.
Do...do you know where that is?

202
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:18,925
And so what happens here, ladies?

203
00:11:19,085 --> 00:11:20,445
You sit around saying things like,

204
00:11:20,605 --> 00:11:23,405
“This novel has
a delicious sense of irony,

205
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:26,765
“although I think Mabel's character
is more trope than substance.

206
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:28,685
“Could you pass me
the quince paste, please?”

207
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:30,325
Don't anyone engage
with him, alright?

208
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:32,765
Well, pretty much,
and then we open another bottle.

209
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:38,285
‘A Thousand Lies I Have Told',
JM Doolan. She a lawyer?

210
00:11:38,445 --> 00:11:40,205
Ex-prostitute.
Same, same.

211
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:46,205
“‘Doolan's savage first novel
is as gut-wrenchingly moving

212
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:49,125
“as it is devastatingly funny.”

213
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:51,965
She's covered all bases,
hasn't she, old JM?

214
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,725
Well, it's fiction, but it's
clearly based on her own life.

215
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:56,045
It's a good read.

216
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:59,445
I think it's a really brave book.
It's visceral and honest.

217
00:11:59,605 --> 00:12:02,005
I mean, she doesn't protect
these sleazy, depraved men.

218
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:04,485
Hold on, hold on. Back up. Rewind.

219
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:07,605
Why are all of the menfolk
sleazy and depraved,

220
00:12:07,765 --> 00:12:10,205
but the bravest woman on earth isn't?

221
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:12,285
Wasn't she porking them for coin?

222
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:13,845
Oh, hang on.

223
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:16,885
This is the ex you said
spent half his life in brothels.

224
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:19,365
No wonder
he's so touchy.

225
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,045
I told you that stuff in confidence.

226
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:25,605
That was therapy.
No.

227
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:28,565
See, as I've told you
on SO many previous occasions,

228
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:30,085
I'm not your therapist.

229
00:12:30,245 --> 00:12:31,805
I'm your ex-wife, OK?

230
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:35,485
And if you're gonna offload your
squalid little personal life onto me

231
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:38,805
then you run the risk that I will
repeat it for my friends' amusement.

232
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:41,965
Old Sally's looking good, isn't she?
No, no.

233
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,245
Divorce really seems to suit her.
No!

234
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:46,565
Sally is a neighbour, OK,

235
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,565
and as such,
she is strictly a no-fly zone.

236
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:52,125
Are we absolutely clear on that?
Alright.

237
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:55,205
I'm just getting to the stage
where I can recall your good points.

238
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:57,805
Really? What are they?

239
00:12:57,965 --> 00:12:59,645
Phone ahead and I might tell you.

240
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:02,605
Come on. What are they?

241
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:05,005
I'm gonna report your mother
to child welfare.

242
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:07,765
There's absolutely bugger all
to eat in this place.

243
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:10,725
There's some old bread
in the pantry.

244
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:17,445
“A necessary
but not sufficient condition.”

245
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:21,845
What the hell does that mean?
This is frying my brain.

246
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:24,605
Don't go anywhere near the
living room, then, for God's sake.

247
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:26,245
It's brutal in there, isn't it?
Mm.

248
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,725
Legal studies.

249
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:29,685
‘Herewith', ‘Forthwith',

250
00:13:29,845 --> 00:13:32,245
“Pertaining to
but not inclusive of...”

251
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:34,445
This is how people
control us, isn't it —

252
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,005
make it all so mysterious
the rest of us don't understand.

253
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:40,765
Yes, that's why the law and religion
were in Latin for centuries,

254
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:42,685
but then they realised
they could make English

255
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:44,805
just as incomprehensible
as a dead language.

256
00:13:44,965 --> 00:13:47,005
So if I understand you correctly,

257
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:48,565
you make your living
strangling words

258
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:50,525
So a jury doesn't know
which way is up.

259
00:13:50,685 --> 00:13:52,845
Yeah. We also get to wear wigs.

260
00:13:53,005 --> 00:13:56,125
It's why law's a four-year course.

261
00:13:56,285 --> 00:14:00,925
I could take you through the nuances
over a pub lunch, if you'd like.

262
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:05,005
I can't. I wanna go for a jog later
and I've gotta get this essay done.

263
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:08,085
You know, I am thinking
of having your DNA tested.

264
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,445
There you go.

265
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:16,765
When did it change from ‘For sale'
to ‘Selling', do you think?

266
00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:18,725
Wouldn't you love
to be in that meeting?

267
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:22,765
You know, some child genius saying,
“Sale' is so passive.

268
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:25,405
“We need an action.
We need a doing word.”

269
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,365
I bet they're hoping it makes
people ignore all the dry rot

270
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:31,245
and think, “Shit, we'd better hurry
‘cause they're really selling.”

271
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:37,565
I'm thinking of
abandoning my compost sandwich here

272
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:39,125
and getting a pub lunch.

273
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:41,325
Would you be up for that?

274
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:42,965
Mr Greene.

275
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:46,525
We need you to come
with us to the station

276
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,365
in regard to the abduction
of a 15-year-old girl

277
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:51,045
in Surry Hills three months ago.

278
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:53,925
Oh, yes. Hey, this is
not how it looks.

279
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:55,525
I promise.
OK.

280
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:58,725
This is police harassment
on quite a large scale

281
00:14:58,885 --> 00:15:00,325
and I will not be cowed by this.

282
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:04,125
You can tell Cal McGregor from me,
this will not break my spirit.

283
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:05,885
Maybe you should get a lawyer.
ow!

284
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:11,205
OK, see you.
Thanks.

285
00:15:11,365 --> 00:15:12,685
Sorry about this
misunderstanding, Mr Greene.

286
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:17,205
Yes, I'll bet you bloody are.
What about some bickies next time?

287
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:22,845
Barnyard.

288
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,525
Cleave.

289
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:27,365
You're looking well.

290
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:29,005
I'm fine. Thanks.

291
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:33,005
No, I mean it. You've dropped
a couple of pounds. Back at the gym?

292
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,645
It was about time.

293
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,645
What brings you here?

294
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,965
Never fuck a premier.

295
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,725
Cleaver.

296
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:46,165
Lawrence! As I live and breathe.

297
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:48,485
Whom have we offended now?

298
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:51,365
I appear to have upset
the board of Omnico.

299
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:52,845
Brilliant. How?

300
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:54,325
I believe they were
under the impression

301
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:56,845
they'd invited me to a board meeting
to help them unpick

302
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:59,845
their ongoing commitment
to excellence.

303
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:04,445
So are you briefing anyone
in particular these days?

304
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:06,685
I've been briefing Rob Curlewis
on a few things.

305
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:09,325
Rob Curlewis. Oh, very nice.

306
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:12,445
He's a good man. I'm sure
you'll make a dynamic duo.

307
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,925
This won't require
Rob's services.

308
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:16,405
Why?

309
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:18,605
Omnico's embarrassed.
They don't want anyone to know.

310
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:20,165
They're not pursuing it.

311
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:23,485
What about Lawrence's day in court?
What about the media?

312
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:25,245
That's what I said, Cleaver.

313
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:27,765
Listen, Lawrence. I'd consider myself
lucky if I was you.

314
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:29,645
This is what? Your ninth offence?

315
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:31,445
Keep this up,
they'll send you to jail.

316
00:16:31,605 --> 00:16:32,925
Over my dead body.

317
00:16:33,085 --> 00:16:36,405
Oh, Cleaver — a man who truly
understands the value of language.

318
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:39,045
Certainly no-one
distorts it like he does.

319
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:40,685
Listen, Lawrence. I've gotta run.

320
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:42,845
Cleave.
Barney.

321
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:47,565
Shame you two have fallen out.
I always saw you as inseparable.

322
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:50,965
Oh, well, Lawrence,
we're both to blame.

323
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,725
It happens in the best of
barrister-solicitor relationships.

324
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:56,925
You know, you think you've made
a professional commitment for life.

325
00:16:57,085 --> 00:17:00,085
After a while, you start
taking each other for granted.

326
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:04,165
His briefs started dropping off,
I wouldn't get back to him.

327
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:07,605
Sometimes a whole month would
go past and he wouldn't brief me once

328
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:09,485
and I didn't even notice.

329
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:12,205
Hmm, very sad.

330
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,765
But Barney also mentioned something
about you having sex with his wife.

331
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:18,365
Well, there was that too, yeah.

332
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:34,125
Open up! It's the police!

333
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:40,405
Oh, that is so great for you guys.

334
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:42,125
How long have you
and Jaz been trying?

335
00:17:42,285 --> 00:17:45,125
I want everything we can find on
Cal McGregor. And I mean everything.

336
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:47,125
I wanna know what brand
of nappies he wore.

337
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:50,045
Yeah, hang on. I got
your ultrasound now.

338
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:54,205
Oh, oh, there it is!
Oh, did you cry?

339
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,965
Particularly anything relating
to police harassment, alright?

340
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,885
Nicole? Hey, I can't see from this.

341
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,765
Is it a boy or a girl?
Absolutely urgent, Nicole.

342
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:03,605
Highest priority.

343
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:07,045
Alright, alright, I think...
I think it is a boy.

344
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:09,005
Oh, no, hang on. Maybe it's a girl.

345
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:11,285
What else would the woman
be having? A marmoset?

346
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,485
Oh, look at its... Here.

347
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:15,325
Looks like Newcastle's
in for showers.

348
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:17,645
Can you...
Congrats on the pregnancy, OK?

349
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,845
But can you please tell
my secretary the frigging sex

350
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:22,245
or we're gonna spend the rest
of today watching a woman

351
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:24,325
trying to pick a winner
in a two-horse race

352
00:18:24,485 --> 00:18:27,485
that no-one outside you and your
husband gives a flying root about.

353
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:30,565
OK, thank you, caller.
Thank... Oh, thanks.

354
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:34,445
Oh, sorry.
Yes, of course it was him.

355
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:36,765
Yeah, I told you —
no-one believes me.

356
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:38,605
Yeah, every day, the same.

357
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:40,085
So names?

358
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,565
This government is ever cognisant

359
00:18:42,725 --> 00:18:48,645
of the ongoing, ever present and
ever real threat of global terrorism

360
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:52,045
and we unequivocally applaud...

361
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:55,405
You sure I'm not
committing us to anything?

362
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:58,165
No, the “in principle” covers us.

363
00:18:58,325 --> 00:19:00,765
But it still sounds
like we are committing?

364
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:03,565
Oh, very much so.
Good.

365
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,325
On arrival at 2:10,

366
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:07,485
you will formally greet
the British home secretary

367
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:09,725
and Sir Ryan Telford, head of MI5.

368
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:11,725
Press photos for
10 minutes on the steps.

369
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:14,965
At 2:20, you will escort them
and their party into the building

370
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,805
to be welcomed by their
Australian counterparts.

371
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:18,285
Alright.

372
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:21,485
No cock-ups, fellas.

373
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:24,605
International coverage
bouncing around the globe,

374
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,365
the city in lockdown.

375
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:28,605
I want the Cahill Expressway
shut down,

376
00:19:28,765 --> 00:19:31,525
Martin Place shut down,
Hyde Park shut down.

377
00:19:31,685 --> 00:19:33,965
Anything west of New Zealand,
shut it down.

378
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,005
And let's make sure the Feds
pitch in their fair share.

379
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:39,165
You know, it's their show too.

380
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:45,325
I don't want some ABC kids' program
turning this into a circus.

381
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:48,405
So I've spoken to the DPP.

382
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:51,605
Charges are imminent,

383
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:54,885
but the foundation has requested
there be a suppression order.

384
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:56,885
Apparently, they don't
want people knowing

385
00:19:57,045 --> 00:19:59,405
that money given with
the very best intentions

386
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,965
was actually donated to
the drug habit of a rich idiot.

387
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,805
So my name stays out of this?

388
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:08,925
Prison?

389
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:11,245
Oh, mate, I'm not going to prison.

390
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:13,285
Fuck that. I'm not
a bloody criminal!

391
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,325
I can maybe argue two of the charges.

392
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:16,885
Well, what does that mean?

393
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:18,445
You'll only get nine years.

394
00:20:21,725 --> 00:20:25,605
Or we can plead
not guilty to the lot.

395
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:28,805
And...?
You'll get 12.

396
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:30,605
Are you bullshitting me?

397
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:33,525
Or we can plead guilty from the kick,

398
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:36,045
show remorse, throw ourselves
on the court's mercy.

399
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:37,685
Which will get me what?!

400
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:40,965
Seven. Five if the judge is in
the same men's club as your wife.

401
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,085
Cleaver, I thought
you were helping me out.

402
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:45,285
Mate, I feel like I'm stepping
outside my comfort zone

403
00:20:45,445 --> 00:20:46,965
a little here when I say this,

404
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:51,485
but what you did,
even by my relatively low standards,

405
00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:53,125
was totally immoral.

406
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,725
Yeah?

407
00:20:54,885 --> 00:21:00,605
Well...how immoral
do you really think it is?

408
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,845
Just like to take your photo.

409
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:13,125
Thanks very much.
I'll see you inside.

410
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:17,125
Madam Home Secretary,
you travel so well.

411
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,045
Thanks very much. See you inside.

412
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:23,805
And so security remains for all of us

413
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:28,125
the critical issue directly confronting
us in a global context

414
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:31,605
as we move into an uncertain future

415
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:33,605
where the nexus between terrorism

416
00:21:33,765 --> 00:21:36,365
and the vulnerabilities
of global interconnectivity

417
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:38,605
become ever more virulent

418
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:44,405
and threaten our core values
of freedom and democracy.

419
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:57,685
Get down!

420
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:10,885
- Everyone, move!
- Let's go!

421
00:22:11,045 --> 00:22:14,285
Hey, hang on! I lost my fucking shoe!

422
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,765
I cannot begin
to understand the humiliation

423
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:37,765
the Attorney-General must
be feeling at this point.

424
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:40,965
Here we have the self-styled
champion of law and order

425
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,845
at the most expensive
intergovernmental security forum

426
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:45,485
ever held in this country,

427
00:22:45,645 --> 00:22:49,085
our skies littered with helicopters,
our city a no-go zone.

428
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:50,925
And what happens?

429
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:54,165
A retired English teacher
manages to slip through the cordon,

430
00:22:54,325 --> 00:22:57,485
have drinks with the British
home secretary and the head of MI5,

431
00:22:57,645 --> 00:23:00,405
then sit centrestage
with all the dignitaries...

432
00:23:00,565 --> 00:23:03,925
..as Cal McGregor lectures us
on the need to be ever-vigilant.

433
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:09,045
Isn't it time this attorney-general did
the honourable thing and resign?

434
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,325
What do we know about Fenton?

435
00:23:18,485 --> 00:23:19,885
Another one of these pricks

436
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:22,285
who make a sport out of
crashing high-profile events.

437
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:23,765
Yeah?

438
00:23:23,925 --> 00:23:28,325
Well, he's not gonna get
any fucking publicity on my watch.

439
00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:32,605
Barry. Cal.

440
00:23:32,765 --> 00:23:34,485
You gotta pull your digit out, mate.

441
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:38,005
This little arsehole's
fucking humiliated us.

442
00:23:38,165 --> 00:23:40,525
There's bugger all
I can do, mate! I'm State.

443
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:44,045
All I can get him on is a trespass,
he'll walk out with a 50 buck fine

444
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:46,765
and the press will be
hanging off his every word.

445
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:50,845
Barry, we have to
gag this prick, pronto!

446
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:53,925
I mean, surely there's
something you can ping him for

447
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:55,525
in the Anti-Terrorism Act.

448
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:59,565
Who's that lunatic judge
that droned on about the Saudis

449
00:23:59,725 --> 00:24:01,445
having the right idea,
chopping off the hands?

450
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:02,925
Beesdon?
Beesdon.

451
00:24:03,085 --> 00:24:04,965
He's insane.

452
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,885
Barry, Beesdon's still
on the bench, isn't he?

453
00:24:08,045 --> 00:24:11,205
They have to be stopped!
We must rise up.

454
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:13,765
We'll have nothing left
if we don't stop them soon!

455
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:17,645
Fenton is one of only
a handful of people to be charged

456
00:24:17,805 --> 00:24:20,165
under the Federal Government's
anti-terrorism legislation.

457
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,645
Oh, God.

458
00:24:21,805 --> 00:24:23,725
Now, I'm not allowed
to comment on this case.

459
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:27,925
Safe to say that it seems that
it was way, way more than a prank.

460
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:31,125
There are some very, very
alarming elements to this

461
00:24:31,285 --> 00:24:34,485
and I thank God
for the great men and women

462
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:39,245
of our intelligence services
who may have saved untold lives.

463
00:24:42,485 --> 00:24:44,765
No, you've got
every right to be angry.

464
00:24:44,925 --> 00:24:49,165
Yeah. Look, I'll write some emails.
I'll call you in the morning.

465
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:51,485
OK.

466
00:24:51,645 --> 00:24:53,965
That was Emily, Ella's mum.

467
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,245
Uh-huh.

468
00:24:56,405 --> 00:25:00,125
You know that school that we spend
so much money at year in, year out

469
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:02,605
that should be delivering
the best possible education?

470
00:25:02,765 --> 00:25:04,485
I know where
our children go to school.

471
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:06,805
Well, Emily just told me something

472
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:09,925
that confirms what the kids told me
on Tuesday at our debrief.

473
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:11,725
Your what?

474
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,405
My sharing time — focus one-on-one
with the children.

475
00:25:14,565 --> 00:25:16,165
You refer to it as a ‘debrief'?

476
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:18,365
It's just a term!
Sure.

477
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:23,125
Do you know what they do on wet days
at lunchtime? They watch movies.

478
00:25:23,285 --> 00:25:25,405
On Tuesday, they watched
‘Wind in the Willows'.

479
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,885
I don't follow.

480
00:25:27,045 --> 00:25:29,365
Emily thinks it's nothing
but childminding. She's right.

481
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:32,125
I mean, surely it's
the school's responsibility

482
00:25:32,285 --> 00:25:36,325
to provide a proper educational
indoor activity when it's wet.

483
00:25:36,485 --> 00:25:38,965
We send our children there
at considerable expense

484
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:41,165
to get core learnings,
not watch cartoons.

485
00:25:41,325 --> 00:25:44,405
“Core learnings”?
I don't see the problem.

486
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:47,325
Well, Emily and Denise are ropeable.

487
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:49,205
Really? ‘Cause of
‘Wind in the Willows'?

488
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:52,125
Maybe we should set up some sort
of victims' support group.

489
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:55,205
Hey, it's not funny! What if we didn't
let our kids watch cartoons?

490
00:25:55,365 --> 00:25:56,885
Yeah, but we do!

491
00:25:57,045 --> 00:25:59,365
And we bought them
‘Wind in the Willows' three years ago.

492
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:03,845
I grew up on Bugs Bunny
and I've survived relatively intact.

493
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:07,365
Babe, what is this about?

494
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:13,885
You're a terrific mum. You don't
need life coaching tips from Emily.

495
00:26:14,045 --> 00:26:16,285
Have you thought some more
about going back to work?

496
00:26:16,445 --> 00:26:19,285
I don't want to go back to the bar.

497
00:26:20,565 --> 00:26:22,125
I couldn't.

498
00:26:24,205 --> 00:26:26,485
You're a brilliant woman, hey?

499
00:26:26,645 --> 00:26:29,605
The bar's not your only option.

500
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:35,485
I'm here now, for them,
for you, 24/7, 365.

501
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:38,925
You hungry?

502
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:40,405
Yeah.

503
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,605
Will you shut up?!

504
00:26:54,885 --> 00:26:56,405
Hello.

505
00:26:56,565 --> 00:26:58,645
I told you
never to phone this number again!

506
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:01,405
Lawrence is in serious shit here, OK?

507
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:03,805
You have to put aside
personal feelings.

508
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:06,165
Sad Who is it?

509
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:09,405
From Fiji?
Yep. I can hardly hear him.

510
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:12,685
No, no, no, no,
you mustn't come here.

511
00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:14,925
Listen, I'm gonna be
at the Imperial Hotel

512
00:27:15,085 --> 00:27:17,405
tomorrow at midday, OK,

513
00:27:17,565 --> 00:27:20,205
and I will stay there for one hour.

514
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:24,165
If you don't turn up,
I will...understand

515
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:26,045
and I will never bother you again.

516
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:33,925
Has he been snorkelling?
Yep.

517
00:27:48,805 --> 00:27:50,805
Oh, g'day, mate.

518
00:27:52,645 --> 00:27:56,445
Oh, Barn, you've gotta be kidding.

519
00:27:59,405 --> 00:28:01,685
Happy birthday
for last week, by the way.

520
00:28:01,845 --> 00:28:05,045
Thank you. Can you get
to your point, please?

521
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:10,765
Alright. You have to
brief me on this.

522
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:14,565
Come on. In your heart,
you know it's the only way.

523
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:17,125
I'll find the right man.

524
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:18,605
Oh, sure.

525
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:21,005
Look, I'm sure there's
millions of barristers

526
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:22,885
who'd kill to be briefed by you.

527
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:25,485
I thought you told me
solicitors were a dime a dozen.

528
00:28:25,645 --> 00:28:30,045
I was angry, hurt, lashing out.

529
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:32,085
I said things I never meant.

530
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:35,805
What I need to know
is what you want.

531
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,325
I made a promise to Scarlet.

532
00:28:38,485 --> 00:28:40,485
Dammit, Barney.

533
00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:45,005
If you want me to walk away, I will,

534
00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:47,245
but I need to hear it
from your lips.

535
00:28:47,405 --> 00:28:50,045
It doesn't matter what I want.
It's how it is.

536
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:52,685
From your lips. Do you
want me to walk away?

537
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:56,085
Don't do this, Cleave.
OK, there's the door.

538
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:57,805
I'm walking out.

539
00:28:57,965 --> 00:29:00,445
We won't need to speak again.

540
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,845
Maybe just... I don't know.

541
00:29:03,005 --> 00:29:07,805
Send me the occasional card,
let me know how you're getting on.

542
00:29:08,805 --> 00:29:11,485
I am standing up
and walking out now, alright?

543
00:29:11,645 --> 00:29:13,845
Here I go.

544
00:29:15,085 --> 00:29:16,405
Oh...

545
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:19,565
Oh, Jesus. This isn't necessary.

546
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:25,445
Tell me what is happening, please.
When can I get out of here?

547
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:27,805
They've refused bail.

548
00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:30,605
But they can't, can they?

549
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:33,445
I just committed trespass —
a fine, a reprimand.

550
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,085
No, you've been
charged with offences

551
00:29:36,245 --> 00:29:37,845
under the Anti-Terrorism Act.

552
00:29:39,485 --> 00:29:40,805
I'm not a terrorist!

553
00:29:40,965 --> 00:29:42,485
You are
under this act, my friend.

554
00:29:42,645 --> 00:29:45,245
Pretty much anything you do
under this act is terrorism.

555
00:29:45,405 --> 00:29:48,805
Wear a loud shirt after dark
in Adelaide, they've got you.

556
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:51,365
You just couldn't resist
this one, could you, Lawrence?

557
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:53,605
Not after I read
their press release.

558
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:55,405
It was an ocean of mixed metaphors.

559
00:29:55,565 --> 00:29:59,525
Well, I'm afraid there's nothing
metaphorical about it now.

560
00:30:01,845 --> 00:30:04,365
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

561
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:08,605
you may have read some
highly irresponsible articles

562
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,765
suggesting that trials such as this

563
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:13,685
conducted under
the Anti-Terrorism Act

564
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,325
resemble witch hunts.

565
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:17,965
Let me set your minds at ease.

566
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:21,365
Although there will be some aspects
of this trial that are different,

567
00:30:21,525 --> 00:30:27,405
these proceedings remain
very much open and transparent

568
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:31,445
in the best tradition
of the Australian judicial system.

569
00:30:32,445 --> 00:30:34,245
Ms Crown.

570
00:30:35,245 --> 00:30:38,805
Your Honour, my opening remarks
may touch on certain matters

571
00:30:38,965 --> 00:30:40,925
pertaining to national security.

572
00:30:41,085 --> 00:30:44,045
Therefore, I would like
to respectfully request

573
00:30:44,205 --> 00:30:48,725
that my opening address be held
in camera without the public.

574
00:30:48,885 --> 00:30:50,325
Of course.

575
00:30:50,485 --> 00:30:52,285
Clear the court.

576
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:58,525
Your Honour, this is an opening
address. It's not evidentiary.

577
00:30:58,685 --> 00:31:02,125
My client is a retired
English teacher.

578
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:06,725
The Crown, by its own admission,
cannot adduce evidence

579
00:31:06,885 --> 00:31:10,365
that my client was
in possession of even a BB gun

580
00:31:10,525 --> 00:31:14,525
let alone a handgun,
a bazooka, a landmine...

581
00:31:14,685 --> 00:31:17,005
Your Honour, we have
made our position clear.

582
00:31:17,165 --> 00:31:19,725
We do not submit that Mr Fenton

583
00:31:19,885 --> 00:31:23,445
had the intention of committing
violent acts himself.

584
00:31:23,605 --> 00:31:28,645
He had the intention to break into
high-level private security meetings

585
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:30,445
in order to glean information

586
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:34,525
that he could share
with like-minded individuals

587
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:38,165
who would then carry out
acts of terrorism.

588
00:31:38,325 --> 00:31:41,445
OK, let's humour my friend Ms Crown.

589
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:45,125
What was this information
that my client was seeking?

590
00:31:45,285 --> 00:31:51,125
What precious secrets drove my client
to endanger himself in such a way?

591
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,885
The defence requests access

592
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:57,165
to all records and transcripts
of this conference.

593
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:02,565
Your Honour?

594
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,725
I'll reserve my decision.

595
00:32:05,885 --> 00:32:07,965
Let's move on.

596
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:11,565
Yes, the vet was ordering in
some Prozac for our dog Rusty.

597
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:15,205
That's right.

598
00:32:16,205 --> 00:32:21,445
The dog has behavioural problems
and is very anxious and frets.

599
00:32:22,805 --> 00:32:27,765
No, no, listen.

600
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:29,645
You hear that?

601
00:32:31,445 --> 00:32:35,845
No, no, that's the strange thing.
I am here more often.

602
00:32:36,005 --> 00:32:38,525
Let me get this right.

603
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:41,445
Your name is John Smith?

604
00:32:41,605 --> 00:32:43,245
That's it?

605
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:49,765
You're not John Hubert Smith?
John Du Jean Valjean Smith?

606
00:32:49,925 --> 00:32:52,245
It's just John Smith?
Yes.

607
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:55,805
Just Agent John Smith, then? I see.

608
00:32:55,965 --> 00:32:59,885
Your Honour, may I please
read the Crown's witness list?

609
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:02,205
Now we've got
John Smith in the box.

610
00:33:02,365 --> 00:33:07,485
Next we've got a John Jones.
Then Jane Jones.

611
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:09,165
I wonder if those two are married.

612
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:12,565
Mr Greene, you know perfectly well
that it is in the public interest

613
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:16,645
that active intelligence
field officers giving evidence

614
00:33:16,805 --> 00:33:19,165
must be allowed to keep
their identities secret.

615
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:22,205
Move on. Move on quickly.

616
00:33:23,205 --> 00:33:24,725
Mr Bond... I'm sorry.

617
00:33:24,885 --> 00:33:29,565
Mr Smith, you were in charge of
security procedures at the symposium.

618
00:33:29,725 --> 00:33:31,525
How did Lawrence Fenton get inside?

619
00:33:31,685 --> 00:33:35,485
It appears he may have joined
the British delegation on their way in

620
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:37,765
and we presumed him
to be one of theirs

621
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:40,645
and they presumed him
to be one of ours.

622
00:33:40,805 --> 00:33:43,245
And so how long after
observing my client

623
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:48,325
in conversation with
the head of MI5 and ASIO, etc,

624
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,925
did you twig to the possibility
that this former English teacher

625
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:54,205
was not in fact
a crack member of the Johns?

626
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,445
We can do without
the sarcasm, Mr Greene.

627
00:33:57,605 --> 00:34:00,685
These people are our gatekeepers
against a very dangerous world

628
00:34:00,845 --> 00:34:04,565
and it behooves you to remember that
and to respect them.

629
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:07,685
Duly behooved, Your Honour.

630
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,925
Our attention was alerted
shortly after Mr Fenton

631
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:17,725
proposed a birthday singalong
for the British home secretary.

632
00:34:22,885 --> 00:34:25,605
That's it — the full transcript
of everything said at the forum

633
00:34:25,765 --> 00:34:27,645
minus some deletions
for reasons of...

634
00:34:27,805 --> 00:34:29,605
National security.

635
00:34:29,765 --> 00:34:32,365
It's like the night sky.
Everything's been blacked out.

636
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:37,285
Shit. Scarlet can't
see me on the news.

637
00:34:37,445 --> 00:34:39,165
Cleaver Greene.

638
00:34:39,325 --> 00:34:43,125
Look, I can't speak directly
to the press about this case,

639
00:34:43,285 --> 00:34:44,725
but let me just say this —

640
00:34:44,885 --> 00:34:48,525
that when a bloody-minded government
and an irresponsible minister

641
00:34:48,685 --> 00:34:50,605
trample on the democratic rights
of a citizen,

642
00:34:50,765 --> 00:34:52,765
it is one sorry day for this country.

643
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:56,205
I'm sure it is. I'm here
to serve you with a summons.

644
00:34:56,365 --> 00:34:57,845
Pardon?

645
00:34:58,005 --> 00:35:04,005
OK, I'm sorry, but this
little game is over, alright?

646
00:35:04,165 --> 00:35:05,565
You can tell the Attorney-General...

647
00:35:05,725 --> 00:35:08,285
He's the shadow attorney-general,
isn't he?

648
00:35:08,445 --> 00:35:10,525
Who or what
are you talking about?

649
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:13,965
David Potter, the man
suing you for defamation.

650
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,965
He is the shadow attorney-general.

651
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,885
What?

652
00:35:18,045 --> 00:35:21,245
Harry-sorry-Fuckwit is what?

653
00:35:24,685 --> 00:35:26,405
Oh.

654
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:29,765
“Harry-sorry-David Potter
hid like the coward he is

655
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:31,685
‘under the cloak
of parliamentary privilege.”

656
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:33,605
Yeah, taken
completely out of context.

657
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,965
No, said verbatim by you on radio.

658
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:37,765
And then you repeated every word

659
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:40,605
in your stupid, look-at-me,
aren't-lI-clever blog,

660
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:43,365
and I quote,
“Potter's dishonest nature

661
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:44,965
“and contempt for common decency

662
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:46,965
‘makes a mockery
of the position he represents.

663
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:48,525
“He is not fit for public office.”

664
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:50,165
Can't accuse me of not being clear.

665
00:35:50,325 --> 00:35:52,645
How many times has Barney
told you not to drink and blog?

666
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:55,565
You know in the eyes of the law this is
published throughout the planet?

667
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:58,645
How much does this whingeing toerag
think he's gonna get out of me?

668
00:35:58,805 --> 00:36:00,565
Word is around a mill.

669
00:36:03,085 --> 00:36:05,525
I can prove all this stuff.
Oh?

670
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:09,005
“Mr Potter's psychological issues
are clear evidence of a man

671
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:11,685
‘who has a troubled relationship
with his penis.”

672
00:36:11,845 --> 00:36:13,445
Alright, that one's a little trickier.

673
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:14,925
Mmm.

674
00:36:14,949 --> 00:36:22,949
http://hiqve.com/

675
00:36:41,765 --> 00:36:45,365
Honourable Lord Barnaby,

676
00:36:45,525 --> 00:36:48,845
you do me humble honour

677
00:36:49,005 --> 00:36:53,885
in allowing me to pleasure you.

678
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,965
Tell me, are you a peasant girl?

679
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,605
Yes, I...

680
00:37:04,365 --> 00:37:07,405
I can't. I can't.

681
00:37:07,565 --> 00:37:09,365
Hey, love, it's fine.

682
00:37:09,525 --> 00:37:12,845
I can't either.
I feel like a total dork too.

683
00:37:13,845 --> 00:37:16,125
No, let...let me try again.

684
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:18,045
It matters. No, this
Is our special time.

685
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:21,325
Love, there's nothing special
about Wednesday night.

686
00:37:21,485 --> 00:37:24,925
We're not geisha,
Lord Barnaby kind of people.

687
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:29,805
Then can you tell me
what sort of people we are?

688
00:37:29,965 --> 00:37:33,325
Because I don't know anymore.

689
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:35,445
We're just your ordinary,

690
00:37:35,605 --> 00:37:37,725
“root every now and then”
kind of people.

691
00:37:37,885 --> 00:37:39,885
You know, a leg over
on Saturday mornings

692
00:37:40,045 --> 00:37:41,845
when the kids burst in on us,

693
00:37:42,005 --> 00:37:44,605
the occasional grope in the laundry.

694
00:37:45,925 --> 00:37:49,805
I'm looking for something
that I can hang onto

695
00:37:49,965 --> 00:37:53,805
and say, “Yep, this is me.
This is who I am.”

696
00:37:54,925 --> 00:37:57,245
But nothing sticks.

697
00:37:58,805 --> 00:38:00,805
I don't have a clue who I am.

698
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:02,805
Hey.

699
00:38:04,485 --> 00:38:07,445
I don't...I don't trust myself.

700
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:11,605
God...God, I've even
sent the dog insane.

701
00:38:13,885 --> 00:38:15,285
No.

702
00:38:15,445 --> 00:38:17,565
It's a labrador, Barney.

703
00:38:17,725 --> 00:38:20,645
They use them as guide dogs.

704
00:38:20,805 --> 00:38:22,365
Oh!

705
00:38:24,165 --> 00:38:26,245
How can I be expected
to mount a proper defence

706
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:27,725
if I can't get a full transcript?

707
00:38:27,885 --> 00:38:29,205
This is nonsense.

708
00:38:29,365 --> 00:38:30,805
I'd wonder if you'd think that

709
00:38:30,965 --> 00:38:33,805
if the full content of these papers

710
00:38:33,965 --> 00:38:36,565
ever got into
the hands of terrorists

711
00:38:36,725 --> 00:38:41,405
and suddenly your children
were seized from your home

712
00:38:41,565 --> 00:38:45,925
and tortured and butchered
before your very eyes.

713
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,885
Pardon?

714
00:38:49,045 --> 00:38:53,845
I refuse to compromise
the safety of our nation's children

715
00:38:54,005 --> 00:38:58,685
because you want
to grandstand in my court.

716
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:04,685
Let me just quote you one of the few
surviving exchanges, alright —

717
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:07,885
this between the British
home secretary and the head of ASIO.

718
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:11,005
“Sarah, have you been
to our botanical gardens?”

719
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:12,925
“No, I have not.”

720
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:15,685
“Oh, a shame. The begonias
are in full bloom.”

721
00:39:15,845 --> 00:39:17,645
Then six lines are deleted.

722
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:21,125
Then the British home secretary
says, “I love begonias.”

723
00:39:21,285 --> 00:39:27,045
Now, what do we think
was in those deleted six lines?

724
00:39:27,205 --> 00:39:29,485
“No, I've not been
to the botanical gardens.

725
00:39:29,645 --> 00:39:33,045
“We launch a nuclear strike
against Pakistan at 0800.

726
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:34,805
“But I do love begonias.”

727
00:39:34,965 --> 00:39:38,965
It's not relevant what was said.

728
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,445
My client's future

729
00:39:40,605 --> 00:39:42,765
rests on establishing
exactly what was said, Meg.

730
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:45,085
Nothing of any consequence
appears to have been raised at all.

731
00:39:45,245 --> 00:39:46,645
The fact that begonias

732
00:39:46,805 --> 00:39:48,925
was the predominant topic
of conversation

733
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:50,485
is neither here nor there.

734
00:39:50,645 --> 00:39:51,965
Isn't it?
Listen.

735
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:54,925
If you were to illegally wire tap
somebody's phone

736
00:39:55,085 --> 00:39:57,725
and all they happened
to talk about was the weather,

737
00:39:57,885 --> 00:40:00,085
that does not mean
you haven't broken the law.

738
00:40:00,245 --> 00:40:02,765
It just means you didn't
get what you wanted.

739
00:40:02,925 --> 00:40:04,445
Precisely.

740
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:06,765
Let us resume.

741
00:40:06,925 --> 00:40:09,405
Let's cut to the chase, Lawrence.

742
00:40:09,565 --> 00:40:13,765
What the hell possessed you
to bust into this forum?

743
00:40:13,925 --> 00:40:17,325
What these so-called important people
are doing with words,

744
00:40:17,485 --> 00:40:21,965
the way they use language
to actually hide what they mean.

745
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:23,525
It's a form of corruption.

746
00:40:23,685 --> 00:40:27,365
The writer Don Watson
calls them ‘weasel words',

747
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:32,845
where corporations and governments
complicate what they say so much

748
00:40:33,005 --> 00:40:36,245
that there is no longer
any accountability or integrity.

749
00:40:36,405 --> 00:40:38,405
Once we stop believing
in what is being said,

750
00:40:38,565 --> 00:40:42,245
once language loses
its power to connect us,

751
00:40:42,405 --> 00:40:44,725
civilisation is finished.

752
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:49,645
Thank you, Mr Fenton.

753
00:40:51,805 --> 00:40:55,125
They have to be stopped!
We must rise up.

754
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:57,365
We'll have nothing left
if we don't stop them soon!

755
00:40:57,525 --> 00:40:59,245
It is obvious
from this footage

756
00:40:59,405 --> 00:41:01,165
you knew when you
entered the building

757
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,885
that you were doing so illegally.

758
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:05,285
Well, my concern was
that they were using...

759
00:41:05,445 --> 00:41:08,285
Did you knowingly trespass,
Mr Fenton?

760
00:41:08,445 --> 00:41:10,445
I admit I trespassed, but only to...

761
00:41:10,605 --> 00:41:13,125
Yes, it was about words.
We heard you!

762
00:41:13,285 --> 00:41:16,845
“We'll have nothing left
if we don't stop them.”

763
00:41:17,005 --> 00:41:18,885
There's no hidden meaning
in those words, is there?

764
00:41:19,045 --> 00:41:21,445
You seriously expect
this jury to believe

765
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:23,325
that you penetrated
that forum to what?

766
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:24,925
What? Correct their spelling?

767
00:41:25,085 --> 00:41:26,685
- Your Honour.
- No.

768
00:41:26,845 --> 00:41:29,725
I don't care a jot about their spelling
or their split infinitives.

769
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:31,285
Would you tell this court,

770
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:33,085
did you also illegally
attend meetings

771
00:41:33,245 --> 00:41:38,965
at Omnico Communications, Durmack
Chemicals and Pachen Software?

772
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:40,485
Objection, Your Honour.

773
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:42,365
We all know where my friend
is going with this

774
00:41:42,525 --> 00:41:44,845
and we all know she can't go there.

775
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:46,885
Yes, she can.

776
00:41:47,045 --> 00:41:48,645
Yes, I gatecrashed
those meetings, but...

777
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:50,125
Funny choice

778
00:41:50,285 --> 00:41:54,045
given that Omnico, Durmack Chemicals
and Pachen Software

779
00:41:54,205 --> 00:41:57,725
each have direct links to the defence
forces of this country...

780
00:41:57,885 --> 00:42:01,365
Objection, Your Honour. My client has
never been charged with any of this.

781
00:42:01,525 --> 00:42:02,925
Overruled.

782
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:06,405
Look, I don't care what they do.
They're all clones to me.

783
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:11,245
I put it to you that your intent
has never been some quixotic cause,

784
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:13,485
but in reality
you sought to discover

785
00:42:13,645 --> 00:42:16,005
these companies' deepest secrets

786
00:42:16,165 --> 00:42:19,525
in order to undermine
the stability of this country.

787
00:42:19,685 --> 00:42:21,365
You're kidding.
The man's an English teacher.

788
00:42:21,525 --> 00:42:22,565
Mr Greene!

789
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:25,525
Mr Fenton, on May 14 last year,

790
00:42:25,685 --> 00:42:28,205
did you publish in your blog

791
00:42:28,365 --> 00:42:31,605
the actual minutes
of a Pachen Software meeting

792
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:34,405
in which they discussed
their potential role

793
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:37,765
in the deployment
of a military satellite?

794
00:42:37,925 --> 00:42:41,565
l...I only published
the bit where someone said,

795
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,125
“Motivating support

796
00:42:43,285 --> 00:42:46,365
“within a stringent,
regulatised umbrella agreement.”

797
00:42:46,525 --> 00:42:48,925
Yes or no, Mr Fenton?

798
00:42:49,925 --> 00:42:52,245
- Yes.
- Jesus. Fucking blogs.

799
00:42:52,405 --> 00:42:56,605
So you admit you leaked information
from a secret meeting

800
00:42:56,765 --> 00:42:59,245
that anyone from a hostile power...

801
00:42:59,405 --> 00:43:01,125
“Hostile power”, Your Honour?

802
00:43:01,285 --> 00:43:03,845
Be very careful, Mr Greene.

803
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:07,165
Let's drop the harmless
pedant guise, Mr Fenton.

804
00:43:07,325 --> 00:43:10,525
I don't think anyone's buying it.

805
00:43:11,525 --> 00:43:13,925
Clover. Very good to see you again.

806
00:43:14,085 --> 00:43:16,245
You are looking gorgeous as ever.
Cut it, Cal.

807
00:43:16,405 --> 00:43:19,325
I know very well I'm the last person
on earth you wish to see.

808
00:43:19,485 --> 00:43:21,125
You know why I'm here.

809
00:43:21,285 --> 00:43:23,085
I got a fair idea.

810
00:43:24,085 --> 00:43:25,925
I've given more time
and money to the party

811
00:43:26,085 --> 00:43:28,325
than almost anyone else
in the state.

812
00:43:28,485 --> 00:43:32,805
You worked in my father's
electorate office for five years.

813
00:43:32,965 --> 00:43:36,485
I know all you've done, Clove.
And we all love you.

814
00:43:36,645 --> 00:43:38,525
But...

815
00:43:39,725 --> 00:43:41,485
..you're married to a turd.

816
00:43:42,485 --> 00:43:44,485
So I keep hearing.

817
00:43:44,645 --> 00:43:47,925
And what he's done,
no-one can forgive.

818
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:50,085
It's not about him!

819
00:43:51,085 --> 00:43:53,165
Your eldest goes to ALC,
doesn't she?

820
00:43:53,325 --> 00:43:55,605
Mm.
You know that world.

821
00:43:55,765 --> 00:43:57,645
How do you think my two girls
will survive there

822
00:43:57,805 --> 00:43:59,125
if this ever becomes known?

823
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:02,085
And how the hell do you think
the charity will recover?

824
00:44:02,245 --> 00:44:03,805
I have worked so hard for them.

825
00:44:03,965 --> 00:44:08,405
We are keeping it under wraps, Clove.
None of us want this to get out.

826
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:10,325
The moment he's sentenced
the gloves will come off.

827
00:44:10,485 --> 00:44:14,645
You know that. It will go viral.

828
00:44:17,485 --> 00:44:18,885
Give me an out, Cal.

829
00:44:19,045 --> 00:44:21,205
My daughters and I
don't deserve this.

830
00:44:21,365 --> 00:44:26,525
There must be some...
arrangement we can come to,

831
00:44:26,685 --> 00:44:28,365
some way of...

832
00:44:29,365 --> 00:44:31,525
..massaging this.

833
00:44:32,525 --> 00:44:34,885
There he sits,

834
00:44:35,045 --> 00:44:40,525
the most dangerous criminal mind
of the 21st century —

835
00:44:40,685 --> 00:44:44,365
this man who taught
Austen and Dickens

836
00:44:44,525 --> 00:44:47,245
at a private school for 27 years

837
00:44:47,405 --> 00:44:52,685
before he took an early retirement
so that he could nurse his dying wife.

838
00:44:52,845 --> 00:44:55,285
They want you to believe

839
00:44:55,445 --> 00:45:00,765
that he is capable of tearing down
the walls of this country.

840
00:45:00,925 --> 00:45:06,085
Are we really that afraid
and untrusting now?

841
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,245
Isn't it interesting

842
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:13,445
that when people talk about the
measures needed to protect freedom

843
00:45:13,605 --> 00:45:17,725
they are usually discussing
ways of limiting it?

844
00:45:18,725 --> 00:45:21,725
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Crown has no case.

845
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,565
All my client committed was
a minor trespass and they know it.

846
00:45:25,725 --> 00:45:28,605
Lawrence Fenton's sole mission

847
00:45:28,765 --> 00:45:34,925
is to have us say what we mean
as clearly as we can.

848
00:45:35,085 --> 00:45:41,525
Please, you cannot
send a man to prison for that.

849
00:45:41,685 --> 00:45:47,885
It is very important for each of you
to make up your own minds.

850
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:51,925
My own private view
is of no consequence here.

851
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:56,565
You will have observed the open
and transparent nature of the trial

852
00:45:56,725 --> 00:46:01,645
and much of the prosecution's
case is conjecture.

853
00:46:01,805 --> 00:46:07,405
But as Ms Crown points out
in her fine summation,

854
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:10,525
Australia is at war, like it or not.

855
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:16,325
We have enemies who hourly threaten
our borders and our values.

856
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:22,605
The question then
is could Mr Fenton's presence

857
00:46:22,765 --> 00:46:27,165
jeopardise our security
in this dangerous climate

858
00:46:27,325 --> 00:46:32,245
by exposing certain vulnerabilities

859
00:46:32,405 --> 00:46:37,405
which could now be known
to our enemies?

860
00:46:40,205 --> 00:46:43,765
Of course, only you can decide that.

861
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:56,485
Get in.

862
00:47:09,805 --> 00:47:12,845
Tell me — did you pay Beesdon

863
00:47:13,005 --> 00:47:14,965
or are you just relying
on his dementia?

864
00:47:16,525 --> 00:47:19,445
I understand you're
representing Damien Trengrove.

865
00:47:19,605 --> 00:47:21,005
That's my business.

866
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:23,325
No, it's not. It's mine.

867
00:47:23,485 --> 00:47:25,245
The man's a piece of fungal rot.

868
00:47:25,405 --> 00:47:27,525
At last we have common ground.

869
00:47:27,685 --> 00:47:29,765
Mm, the problem is
if he goes down

870
00:47:29,925 --> 00:47:32,085
a very fine charity
goes down with him.

871
00:47:32,245 --> 00:47:37,205
So what if, by chance,
it doesn't make it to trial?

872
00:47:37,365 --> 00:47:39,005
How could it not?

873
00:47:39,165 --> 00:47:41,125
Well, instead of closing the doors,

874
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:43,085
the Hyacinth Foundation
could stay open

875
00:47:43,245 --> 00:47:48,085
with one very generous donation
of 3.1 million from the Trengroves —

876
00:47:48,245 --> 00:47:50,525
a million more than was stolen —

877
00:47:50,685 --> 00:47:54,405
Damien never finds work again,
Clover Trengrove divorces him

878
00:47:54,565 --> 00:47:57,525
and the fungal rot dies sometime
in the not too distant future

879
00:47:57,685 --> 00:47:59,645
in a puddle of his own vomit.

880
00:47:59,805 --> 00:48:03,005
What am I expected to do?

881
00:48:04,325 --> 00:48:07,965
The DPP will, obviously,
need a submission from you

882
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:11,165
incorporating no end
of eminent medical opinions,

883
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:13,565
especially one from
a leading professor of neurology

884
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:15,525
which argues that Mr Fungal Rot

885
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:19,445
was prescribed
a relatively untested medication

886
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,365
that may well have fogged his reason

887
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:24,165
and caused a pattern
of compulsive behaviour.

888
00:48:24,325 --> 00:48:26,205
You want me to cover your arse.

889
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:27,965
Well, the party's arse.

890
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:33,565
But in return, I will reluctantly
call off the dogs of war.

891
00:48:33,725 --> 00:48:39,285
OK, but you have to help me
with this bullshit Fenton case.

892
00:48:39,445 --> 00:48:41,845
Oh, it's got nothing to do with me.

893
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:46,885
But as an impartial outsider,
I would say he's fucked.

894
00:48:47,885 --> 00:48:49,285
Ah.

895
00:48:49,445 --> 00:48:51,405
Close the door behind you, will you?

896
00:48:52,405 --> 00:48:55,125
And don't push your luck.

897
00:48:58,725 --> 00:49:01,165
Jesus, is this creep
gonna get away with this?

898
00:49:02,165 --> 00:49:04,605
This one is particularly
creepy, isn't it?

899
00:49:04,765 --> 00:49:08,485
Yeah, I think I even liked
your cannibal better.

900
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:11,325
What? What is it?

901
00:49:11,485 --> 00:49:13,725
Your friend's baby.

902
00:49:13,885 --> 00:49:18,845
Uh... Oh, a boy.
Gonna call him Dylan.

903
00:49:19,885 --> 00:49:21,485
Nice one.

904
00:49:22,565 --> 00:49:24,085
Yep.

905
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:26,565
Lawrence Fenton,

906
00:49:26,725 --> 00:49:33,245
I sentence you to a period of seven
years in a maximum security prison.

907
00:49:33,405 --> 00:49:37,125
You'll be eligible for parole
in five years.

908
00:49:37,285 --> 00:49:39,245
Please remove the prisoner.

909
00:49:39,405 --> 00:49:41,365
Five years? Are you out of your mind?

910
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:44,365
Mr Greene, how dare you!

911
00:49:44,525 --> 00:49:45,845
All rise.

912
00:49:46,005 --> 00:49:48,605
I am...

913
00:49:48,765 --> 00:49:50,685
I'm...I'm a...

914
00:50:14,525 --> 00:50:16,565
Could use a beer.

915
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:19,165
Yeah, I gotta get home.

916
00:50:21,165 --> 00:50:23,245
Goodbye, Cleaver.

917
00:50:29,205 --> 00:50:31,005
Beesdon's insane.

918
00:50:31,165 --> 00:50:35,205
There are a thousand grounds
of appeal from day one alone.

919
00:50:36,205 --> 00:50:38,045
No.

920
00:50:39,045 --> 00:50:41,245
No?

921
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,965
I'm on the front page
of the papers, am I not?

922
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:46,885
People have to notice now.

923
00:50:47,885 --> 00:50:51,965
There's a tide in the affairs of men,
Cleaver, and ours is turning.

924
00:50:53,165 --> 00:50:55,845
Maybe I can better
win my war from here.

925
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:58,605
Besides, it's quiet, I get to read

926
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:01,805
and no-one seems interested
in me as a toy boy.

927
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:07,245
May I read you something?

928
00:51:07,405 --> 00:51:12,125
It's an extract
from a letter I carry.

929
00:51:15,165 --> 00:51:21,525
“Sand ate into our skins like an
abrading stone, yet we felt nothing.

930
00:51:21,685 --> 00:51:24,965
‘Instead, we stood in ox-dumb awe,

931
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:28,885
“diminished and humbled
by these weathered, ancient blocks

932
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:34,765
“that were once some ruler's
vainglorious grab at immortality.”

933
00:51:38,165 --> 00:51:44,325
My grandfather wrote that to my
grandmother from Cairo in 1915.

934
00:51:45,565 --> 00:51:47,965
He left school when he was 12,

935
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:50,925
worked all his life on the railways.

936
00:51:51,965 --> 00:51:55,365
That's how people
used to communicate.

937
00:52:01,165 --> 00:52:03,765
Hm.

938
00:52:08,685 --> 00:52:11,245
Oh, God. What have you
done to yourself?

939
00:52:11,405 --> 00:52:13,605
I bring manifold gifts —

940
00:52:13,765 --> 00:52:19,365
a vacuum cleaner and a moron's guide
to constitution law for Fuzz.

941
00:52:19,525 --> 00:52:23,245
He's out jogging, which is why
I suggest you always ring first.

942
00:52:23,405 --> 00:52:26,685
Oh, a shame. Could've done
with his company.

943
00:52:26,845 --> 00:52:29,405
It seems like
the minor threat of terrorism

944
00:52:29,565 --> 00:52:34,365
worries people more
than tidal waves of stupidity.

945
00:52:36,565 --> 00:52:38,565
I'll call you a taxi
and talk to you later.

946
00:52:38,725 --> 00:52:42,205
Can I come in?
Yoga group, OK?

947
00:53:25,405 --> 00:53:26,925
Who was it?

948
00:53:27,085 --> 00:53:29,205
No-one.

949
00:53:29,365 --> 00:53:30,925
Someone flogging something.

950
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:42,405
Cleaver.
Julie.

951
00:53:57,605 --> 00:53:59,685
Missy.
