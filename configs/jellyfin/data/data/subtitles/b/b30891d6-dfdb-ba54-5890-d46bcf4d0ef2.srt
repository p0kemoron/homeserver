1
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:42,325
Good morning.
Morning.

2
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:44,685
What are you doing?
Eating breakfast.

3
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,645
That's not breakfast.

4
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:51,965
Where's Mum?
In the bathroom, crying.

5
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,725
Right.

6
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:56,125
Why?

7
00:00:56,285 --> 00:00:58,165
Didn't like the picture
in the paper.

8
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:05,725
I think she looks really pretty.

9
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:14,685
Come on, unlock the bloody door.
No.

10
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:17,605
I don't want to see you.
I can't see you. Go away.

11
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:20,845
You have to see me.
What the hell is this about?

12
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:24,285
Nothing happened.

13
00:01:24,445 --> 00:01:28,645
Well, something bloody happened.
There's a photo of it, woman.

14
00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:32,405
We just kissed, that was all.

15
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:35,125
I don't believe you.
That was it.

16
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:44,765
OK, he...he felt my breast briefly once,
then we realised it was wrong.

17
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:49,605
Open the fuckin' door!

18
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:05,005
What the hell were you doing there
in the first place?

19
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:08,685
I just...l felt so alone.

20
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:11,085
Oh, screw alone. Talk to me.

21
00:02:11,245 --> 00:02:12,605
I can't.

22
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,325
I can't take any more
humiliation, Barney.

23
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:19,005
How am I going to face anyone?

24
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:22,045
Oh, I'm not much interested
in muckraking, Neil.

25
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:23,325
Tick-tack.

26
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:25,765
You know, you and I,
we don't trade in gossip.

27
00:02:25,925 --> 00:02:29,085
If David Potter chooses to knock off
a good mate's wife, his business.

28
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:31,205
But what does hurt is...

29
00:02:31,365 --> 00:02:33,405
..Ms Engels was a trusted...
Mum, where are we going?

30
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:35,405
Shh.
.. member of my inner sanctum.

31
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:38,165
Privy to all manner
of private information...

32
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,765
This is miles away.
What, you've got legs, haven't you?

33
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,245
Move, quickly. Go.

34
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:45,005
The sort of information that could
jeopardise the health and safety...

35
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,485
Mummy loves you very much.

36
00:02:46,645 --> 00:02:49,285
..of folk like you and I and the great
people of this great state.

37
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:51,445
I dread to think...

38
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:55,165
..what state secrets were traded
in that hotel bed.

39
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:58,085
But, look, you know who I blame
in all of this, Neil?

40
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,565
Me.

41
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:01,445
Yep, the buck must rest here.

42
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:06,525
trust too much,
I believe in giving people a fair go.

43
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:10,445
I wanna hope that people can be
better than they think they are.

44
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:13,525
Quite frankly, Neil, it hurts.

45
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:15,645
Uh...'m only human.

46
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:18,525
And not a bad quality to have,
mate, in one of our pollies.

47
00:03:18,685 --> 00:03:22,045
Oh, that's very nice of you
to say that, Neil.

48
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:24,245
Ladies and gentlemen,

49
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:28,685
the Reverend Ron Drury is,
as his stepbrother was before him,

50
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:31,525
a prophet imbued with
the gift of healing.

51
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:37,725
Now, the complainants in this matter,
by their own admission,

52
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:44,005
consented to being, and I quote,
“rubbed with unguents and oils

53
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:49,925
“and further CONSENTED to
sexual intercourse with the accused,

54
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:54,285
“in the hope that they may be
healed of possession by the devil.”

55
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:59,205
Ladies and gentlemen,
it was only much, much later,

56
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:03,645
after the complainants realised
that the rashes they were suffering

57
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:08,885
were not in fact the devil's work,
but the result of aggressive solvents

58
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:12,845
used in the Reverend Ron's giftware
shop, where they were employed,

59
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:17,045
did these women think
to cry foul rape.

60
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:22,245
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
a charge of rape cannot be made

61
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:25,325
simply because one regrets
consenting to sex.

62
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:29,445
You'd be locking up 90%
of the population on that basis.

63
00:04:29,605 --> 00:04:34,685
The complainants in this matter
seek vengeance, ladies and gentlemen,

64
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:38,205
and vengeance never
results in justice.

65
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:42,285
Vengeance results in misery.

66
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:46,525
Mr Greene, have you done
the community any favours today

67
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:48,605
by getting Ron Drury
off rape charges?

68
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:51,085
Polly something or other, right?

69
00:04:51,245 --> 00:04:55,405
On the ‘Seven Days This Night
This Day Today...

70
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:59,125
..This Night Will Be The Same
As Tomorrow Project'?

71
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:02,045
Yes, one of those. But you haven't
answered my question.

72
00:05:02,205 --> 00:05:03,525
Ask me again.

73
00:05:03,685 --> 00:05:06,445
Ron Drury has a history of abusing
women and getting away with it...

74
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:07,965
No, he doesn't.

75
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:12,765
Reverend Ron Drury has a habit
of treating sick women

76
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:15,085
who are seeking
alternative therapies,

77
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:17,525
having been abandoned by the
conservative medical establishment.

78
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,565
It's the AMA you wanna
be pointing your finger out.

79
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:21,045
What's your surname again?

80
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:22,645
So it's appropriate for Drury

81
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:24,685
to continue practising
his voodoo, is it?

82
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:26,965
That's a hell of a surname.

83
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:35,165
Maybe we can make a deal.
Oh, yeah?

84
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:37,245
I don't really wanna do this story

85
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:39,125
about you getting
a serial rapist off.

86
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:40,405
Don't you now?
No.

87
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:42,445
I'd rather do a story on
your little friend Melissa

88
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:44,485
and how she's coping after
the death of Joshua Floyd.

89
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:47,245
You obviously haven't met Melissa.

90
00:05:47,405 --> 00:05:50,645
Nobody who knows Melissa
would describe her as ‘little'.

91
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:53,125
So do we have a deal?

92
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,485
Oh, how I wish we had a deal.

93
00:05:56,645 --> 00:06:00,285
Um, no, I don't think so.
Melissa's not doing any interviews.

94
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:02,205
That's a pity.

95
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:03,925
Yes, it's a pity.

96
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:07,165
I guess I'll see you
on the telly then.

97
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,805
I guess so.

98
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:13,285
It's, uh, Nesbitt, by the way.
Polly Nesbitt.

99
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:14,765
Mmm.

100
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:18,045
I'll see you on the telly, Nesbitt.
Yes.

101
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,285
So guess who managed to score

102
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:31,485
two el primo tickets to
Mr Neil Diamond this evening?

103
00:06:31,645 --> 00:06:33,685
You're kidding me.

104
00:06:33,845 --> 00:06:36,325
You are fucking kidding me.

105
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:39,325
You sweet man, you!

106
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:41,525
Mmmm.

107
00:06:41,685 --> 00:06:43,005
Oh, God!

108
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:44,685
The show's not till 8:00.
Yeah.

109
00:06:44,845 --> 00:06:49,245
So I was thinking a really,
really long breakfast in bed.

110
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:51,085
Oh, oh, yeah.

111
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:54,005
Hey, sweet?
Mmm?

112
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,165
There's one more thing
angel needs you to do first.

113
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:57,925
You name it, I'll do it.

114
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,325
Cleaver's missed another payment.

115
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:02,485
Right.

116
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:04,405
Come on, it's just business.
Yeah, I know.

117
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:06,325
It's 200 grand.
Yeah, I know.

118
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:09,925
Oh, don't be grumpy
with angel, sweet.

119
00:07:10,085 --> 00:07:13,325
Look, it's just a little hard
for me. You know, I owe him.

120
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:16,365
I sometimes think
if it wasn't for Cleaver,

121
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:18,125
you and I wouldn't be together.

122
00:07:18,285 --> 00:07:21,965
Oh, don't say that. Never say that.
We were always meant to be together.

123
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,925
It's a lot of money, you know.
I won't let him get away with it.

124
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:29,125
I can't let him get away with it.
Yeah, I know.

125
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:33,485
So I was thinking,
maybe I could sub Cleaver out.

126
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:34,965
Sub him out?

127
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,045
Yeah, well, I've got
this mate of a mate.

128
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:39,405
He's new in town,
he's from the UK.

129
00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:41,525
He's never met Cleave,
he's got no history,

130
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:43,605
he's got no emotional involvement.

131
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:49,725
I'd be really,
really grateful, angel.

132
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:59,285
OK, I will give Cleaver
two more weeks,

133
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,805
but I'm doing it for you,
sweet, and not for him.

134
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:04,205
And if nothing comes in
in that time,

135
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:06,645
you're gonna have to call your mate.

136
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:09,845
Fuckin' love you.

137
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:12,565
Fuckin' love you too.

138
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:22,245
This is nothing in
the scheme of things, mate.

139
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:24,085
I know it's nothing.
We didn't do anything.

140
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:25,565
I believe you.

141
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:28,085
Well, there's no reason
to drop your case against Greene.

142
00:08:28,245 --> 00:08:31,445
The man has got away with every sort
of abuse under the sun.

143
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:33,245
He has to pay.
Couldn't agree more.

144
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:35,085
Weakness to let him off.

145
00:08:35,245 --> 00:08:37,125
Oh, come on, mate. Nut up.

146
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:40,605
He'll call me back into the box.
He'll call Scarlet.

147
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:44,445
He'll eat us alive.
Dave, take him on.

148
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:47,325
After all, he screwed her too.
That's gotta count for something.

149
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:51,045
I thought you said you believed me.
Yeah, but I'm paid to.

150
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:54,085
I did not have sexual relations
with that woman!

151
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:56,805
Oh, God!

152
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:03,045
David Potter and I did not have sex.
Oh, I'm sure you didn't.

153
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:07,125
That's just politics, Engels.
I didn't plan to drag you down.

154
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:10,205
You just presented me with
this gold embossed gift, so...

155
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:12,165
Look, I have a family.

156
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:14,965
I'm not rolling over.
I will hit back.

157
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:27,365
Hey.
Hi.

158
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,365
Hey.
There she is, a married woman.

159
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:32,645
Ah, Mrs Nicole Lee at your service.

160
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:36,245
How was your honeymoon?
Oh, good, yeah. It was fantastic.

161
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:38,045
You've been to Ubud, haven't you?
Mm-hm.

162
00:09:38,205 --> 00:09:42,085
Lovely and romantic and...
Great. That is so good.

163
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:45,245
Mm. Big breakfasts every day
and long walks.

164
00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:48,485
Fantastic.
Yeah, lovely. It was...it truly was.

165
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:54,485
So.

166
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:56,325
Yeah, I just wanted to
sort of catch up

167
00:09:56,485 --> 00:09:58,405
before we see each other
in the office.

168
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,485
Didn't want there to be any tension.
Oh, God, no. Nor do I.

169
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:03,885
No, I'd hate that.
Yeah. So let's not have it.

170
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,885
Yeah, just being alone
with Bevan again

171
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:08,765
reminded me of all the reasons
I married him.

172
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:11,325
He doesn't know about us, does he?
No, nuh.

173
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,885
No, that was...
Yeah, I wasn't married then.

174
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,685
It'd be different now, of course.
Of course.

175
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:25,605
Oh, but I...seriously, Barney,
I want us to keep in touch.

176
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:28,205
Oh. Oh, we will.
Yeah. As friends.

177
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:30,005
We will.
As really good friends.

178
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:31,525
We will.
Alright.

179
00:10:31,685 --> 00:10:34,205
I am so happy that you're happy,
I really am.

180
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:36,645
Happy, I'm happy.
Happy, happy, happy, happy.

181
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:56,645
Happy, happy, happy.

182
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:01,405
You must be loving this.

183
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:06,765
I take my pleasure
where I find it, Harry. Sorry.

184
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:08,245
Shove it.

185
00:11:09,405 --> 00:11:10,685
You win.

186
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:13,085
I withdraw the action.

187
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:14,885
The whole thing?

188
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:16,365
You heard me.

189
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:19,005
You deserve to burn, but...

190
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:23,805
There's, uh...there's
the small matter of my costs.

191
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:26,565
My time doesn't come cheap,
you know, mate.

192
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:29,525
Everything about you comes cheap.

193
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:36,405
What does it say about David Potter
when he withdraws a libel charge

194
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:39,645
against a man who accused him
of being, and I quote,

195
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:46,365
“a sadistic, cowardly, lying buffoon
whose contempt for common decency

196
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:50,325
“makes a mockery
of the position he represents.”

197
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:54,485
Our Shadow Attorney-General clearly
thinks he is all of these things.

198
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:58,205
If that is true,
Mr Potter must resign.

199
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:05,365
Cleaver Greene?

200
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,365
Oh, for God's sake.

201
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:12,525
For the last time, she's not
giving any interviews, OK?

202
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:14,845
And I'm not her fucking agent.
No, that would be me.

203
00:12:15,005 --> 00:12:16,365
My name's Gloria Beckford.

204
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:18,245
I've been trying to get
in touch with Melissa

205
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,325
but she's proving
to be quite elusive.

206
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:22,685
I'd be grateful
if you'd pass this on.

207
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:24,685
OK.

208
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:07,045
Hey. How was your day?

209
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:11,325
Oh. I watched
a documentary on cancer.

210
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:12,565
Great.

211
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,005
Now, look, I thought we might
head out and celebrate.

212
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:18,405
I've had a couple
of little victories today.

213
00:13:21,405 --> 00:13:23,645
I'm going to bed.

214
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:27,165
Oh, come on. It's not even 7:00.
I don't wanna go out.

215
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:30,525
Come on, sweetheart,
you can't hide away forever.

216
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,245
You go out, do whatever you like.

217
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:36,285
Look, a couple of laughs,
a couple of, you know, drinks.

218
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:38,925
You could have a little shower
or something,

219
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,525
freshen up a bit,
get glammed up.

220
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:43,445
It might turn out
better than you think.

221
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:46,045
Come on. Please?

222
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:47,885
It's on me.

223
00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:51,085
Alright, that's enough.

224
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:58,045
Thanks, mate. Keep that change.

225
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:01,445
Melissa. Melissa.
Cleaver, why here?

226
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:03,965
No, here is good.
Here's good. Here's good.

227
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,925
It's all fine. Come on.

228
00:14:06,085 --> 00:14:09,925
No. She's just after a quiet night here,
boys, quiet night.

229
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:11,885
VIPs coming through.

230
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:16,245
Cowra corn-fed chicken
with citrus foam and asparagus.

231
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:19,525
Where is the asparagus from?
I'm sorry, sir?

232
00:14:19,685 --> 00:14:22,285
Well, you've given me
a postcode for the chook

233
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:25,165
as well as
its pre-death eating habits.

234
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:29,765
You've done the same thing for
the mussels, the oysters and the steak.

235
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:33,725
I know for instance that the cow
lived happily in Gippsland

236
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:35,805
where it ate grass.

237
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:38,485
But there is absolutely
nothing in here

238
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,845
about the formative years
of the asparagus.

239
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,565
So if you could please ask the chef.
He'll have the chicken.

240
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:48,445
I don't know anything about Cowra

241
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:52,205
except it's where they kept the Japs
during the Second World War.

242
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:54,485
I hope my bird fared better.
What's going on?

243
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:58,085
They've taken 1,000 shots of me.
What are they expecting me to do?

244
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,525
- Oh!
- What's going on?

245
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:03,085
- Come on! Shove off.
- No, no, no, no.

246
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:08,845
Have you thought any more
about the second book?

247
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:11,605
Why do you ask?

248
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:14,405
Well, I just...I think it could be

249
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:16,485
an important part
of the healing process.

250
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:19,085
I wanted to support you in that.

251
00:15:19,245 --> 00:15:23,085
I mean, you're gonna need
a legal consultant, aren't you?

252
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,805
I presume I'm gonna be
in the second book.

253
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:32,045
No, actually, if you think about it,
it's like, you know,

254
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:35,245
there's more than one perspective
on the story, isn't there?

255
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:37,765
It doesn't just have to be about you.

256
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:42,525
You know, Josh touched
both of our lives, didn't he?

257
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:45,525
Just a thought.

258
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:50,365
Um...that arrived.

259
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:52,245
Some woman. I don't know.

260
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:58,805
Ah.

261
00:15:59,965 --> 00:16:03,845
Fried green tomato ice-cream.

262
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:07,405
Pumpkin and chive sorbet.

263
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,965
Where are they going
with these sorbets?

264
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:15,685
Avocado and nashi pear gelato.

265
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:18,525
Pumpkin...

266
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:25,045
OK.

267
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:26,525
Good.

268
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,965
Good. So that's good.

269
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:51,125
Sister, I was just about to call you.

270
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:53,485
I've been trying to reach you
since yesterday, Cleave.

271
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,365
Oh, this bloody phone.

272
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:58,525
Dad's...died, Cleave.

273
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:02,405
Right.

274
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:06,005
I'm sorry, Cleave.
OK.

275
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:11,885
So, um, it'll be at...Dad's church.

276
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:13,645
You know?
OK.

277
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:17,965
Um, the wake will be at Jane's.
Good.

278
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:24,045
Can I...get another bottle?

279
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:42,365
Oh!

280
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:44,005
Oh!

281
00:17:57,725 --> 00:17:59,445
What happened to Wednesday?

282
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:01,805
What happened to Wednesday? Fuck.

283
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:10,005
Miss, it's me.
I'm just, um, ringing to apologise.

284
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:12,725
I'm sorry I was insensitive
to your needs.

285
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:18,885
Good. Um, listen, I could, uh...
I could really do with a lift.

286
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:22,925
Um, and could you bring a suit?

287
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:32,765
Your dress is caught up.

288
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:38,925
He prided himself
on being a decent man

289
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:42,445
who worked daily
to put food on the table

290
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:48,485
and to teach his children
the worth of human values.

291
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:54,245
Love of family always came first.

292
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:56,605
It gave his life meaning.

293
00:18:56,765 --> 00:18:59,205
And what a life he gave them.

294
00:18:59,365 --> 00:19:02,365
Malaysia, Singapore,

295
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:07,685
where our intrepid explorer set up
a business in the copha trade,

296
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:12,205
before returning here with
his lovely wife, Kate, and the children

297
00:19:12,365 --> 00:19:14,285
in 1979.

298
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:18,565
With the money he made there,
he set up a travel agency

299
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,325
where his attention to detail...

300
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:22,325
I thought your dad
had a hardware store.

301
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:23,965
Wrong funeral.

302
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,445
..wonderful times abroad.

303
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:29,285
The Nankervises have always
had a reputation

304
00:19:29,445 --> 00:19:31,605
for being an intrepid bunch.

305
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:38,485
Keith and Kate took the kids,
Bridie, Wally and Joshua...

306
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:42,125
Excuse me. Thank you.

307
00:19:42,285 --> 00:19:44,805
Here you go, ladies. Thank you.
One each. Thank you very much.

308
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:48,725
Excuse me. I'll just give you
one of these. Thank you.

309
00:19:48,885 --> 00:19:52,045
Can I give you one of these?
Give one of these a read.

310
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:53,845
Sorry, what is this?

311
00:19:54,005 --> 00:19:55,525
It's a...it's a factual account

312
00:19:55,685 --> 00:19:57,805
of the true circumstances
about David Potter and myself.

313
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:01,005
I need you to know that what's being
said in the tabloids and on the radio

314
00:20:01,165 --> 00:20:03,725
about certain misinterpreted events
is not accurate.

315
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:06,005
But my details are included
if you have any queries...

316
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:07,365
OK. Thank you.

317
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:08,845
Hurry, darling, let's go. Come on.

318
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:26,565
You didn't even know my old man.

319
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,765
Oh, I'm not crying about him.
It's about Keith Nankervis.

320
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:32,685
His life had such meaning.

321
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:34,885
Oh,
and every corner was occupied

322
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:37,045
by people he'd spent
a lifetime avoiding.

323
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:38,525
Oh, Aunty Edie.

324
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,405
Sid.

325
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:43,125
My sister Jane.

326
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,005
So, not close then?

327
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:47,285
Where were you?
Uh...

328
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:49,325
Hi, Dad.
Mate, how are you?

329
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:52,845
So, what was so pressing you felt

330
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:55,365
you could miss your own father's
funeral, for Christ's sake?

331
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:58,245
We decided to go
to Keith Nankervis's instead.

332
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:02,005
The travel agent? Why the hell...
He seemed like a wonderful man.

333
00:21:02,165 --> 00:21:04,925
This is Melissa.
I know who you are.

334
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:08,245
Yes, you told me St Thomas's.
His old church.

335
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:10,725
He hasn't stepped foot
inside St Thomas's since...

336
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:12,925
..Father Bart
and the Youth Camp.

337
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:16,405
Do you honestly think I wanted to go
to fucking Keith Nankervis's funeral?

338
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:18,925
Do you think I could feel
any more gutted than I do?

339
00:21:19,085 --> 00:21:21,685
His granddaughter read a poem
that she wrote herself —

340
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:24,765
‘Who Will Be In The Armchair
At Christmas?'

341
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:27,245
You fucking snake in the grass.

342
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:28,965
Aunty Jane, it's a funeral.

343
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,765
Just stay out of this, kid.
It's between me and him.

344
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:36,405
I just want to say to you that
I will never speak to you again.

345
00:21:36,565 --> 00:21:38,845
Finally, an upside.
He went to the wrong church.

346
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:41,165
Oh, bullshit.
We all know why he didn't come.

347
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:44,965
Oh, yes, why was that, Jane?
Denlion Holdings.

348
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,445
Denlion Holdings?
What, is it a West Indian cricketer?

349
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:50,045
You were too gutless
to do it yourself,

350
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:52,445
so you got somebody else
to do your dirty work for you.

351
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:54,085
What is the mad woman talking about?

352
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:55,645
So you're saying
you know nothing about

353
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:57,885
Dad selling off all his shares
two months before he died?

354
00:21:58,045 --> 00:21:59,645
Exactly when you learnt
you were getting nothing!

355
00:21:59,805 --> 00:22:02,525
I have no idea what
either of you are on about.

356
00:22:02,685 --> 00:22:05,565
Dad sold everything off
to this company called Denlion

357
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:07,405
when he was in care.

358
00:22:07,565 --> 00:22:09,485
They gave him less than
a third of the value,

359
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:11,445
not even enough
to pay off the mortgage.

360
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:13,165
Why would he do that?

361
00:22:13,325 --> 00:22:15,605
Well, apparently this guy
convinced him

362
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:17,205
that the world was
about to collapse

363
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:19,525
and if he wanted to leave
Jane and me anything...

364
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:21,885
..then he'd have to
sell it all off.

365
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:24,885
He knows. He's bluffing!
I don't bloody know.

366
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:26,645
I don't... don't think he does.

367
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,205
When he lies, he taps
the fingers on his left hand.

368
00:22:29,365 --> 00:22:33,325
And leans to one side.
Yeah, his left. He's not lying.

369
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:36,845
You really weren't behind this?

370
00:22:37,005 --> 00:22:41,205
Do you honestly think I am that bad?

371
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:42,805
Sorry, Cleave.

372
00:22:42,965 --> 00:22:45,925
Everyone's just
a little bit emotional.

373
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:51,525
Would some cake help the jaw?
No, some cake wouldn't help.

374
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:58,005
How was the funeral?

375
00:22:58,165 --> 00:23:03,805
Oh, um...Don spoke...at length.

376
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,605
I think Keith Nankervis's funeral
might have been the wise choice.

377
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:12,925
Is, um...is Melissa OK?

378
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:15,085
She's not exactly
looking in top form.

379
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:19,045
I'm sensitive to her needs.
Oh, that's what I was afraid of.

380
00:23:20,805 --> 00:23:22,405
I'm sorry about your dad.

381
00:23:22,565 --> 00:23:24,565
He was a lovely man.

382
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:27,525
‘Bye.
See you, darl.

383
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:37,725
That's not it, Dad.
What's not what, mate?

384
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:40,085
There is a life beyond death.

385
00:23:40,245 --> 00:23:42,725
Yeah, it's called
becoming a judge.

386
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:44,485
Come to a prayer night
with me, please.

387
00:23:44,645 --> 00:23:45,965
Oh, mate.

388
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,405
You always said not to judge something
without trying it first.

389
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:51,005
That was just drugs, alright?

390
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:56,485
In all other matters I'm very much
a “judge early and often” kind of a guy.

391
00:23:58,285 --> 00:24:01,085
See ya.
See ya.

392
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:05,925
Pull over.

393
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:07,685
Just pull over.

394
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:07,125
What are you doing to me, comrade?

395
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:09,285
You must be the only man alive

396
00:25:09,445 --> 00:25:11,325
who could lose a defamation case
against Cleaver Greene.

397
00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:12,805
Withdrew. Not lost.

398
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:15,085
First whiff of trouble,
you pop on a skirt and play dead.

399
00:25:15,245 --> 00:25:17,605
What more do you want me to do?
I've denied it, she's denied it.

400
00:25:17,765 --> 00:25:19,365
Would you please stop denying it?

401
00:25:22,885 --> 00:25:26,005
We've won focus groups.
You're onto a good thing.

402
00:25:26,165 --> 00:25:28,645
Women are taking notice of you.
Men are jealous. The chick is hot.

403
00:25:28,805 --> 00:25:31,445
For a moment there you looked like
you might be a bit of a player.

404
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:33,405
I would have been
crucified in court.

405
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,765
I am a lawyer.
Soam I!

406
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,285
So's everyone.

407
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,925
Just go out there and own it,
or go to the back benches.

408
00:25:40,085 --> 00:25:41,725
And how are you gonna
manage that, Jack?

409
00:25:41,885 --> 00:25:44,245
We don't even have the numbers
to field a cricket team.

410
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:45,845
Who are you gonna promote, Allsop?

411
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:48,765
One more cock-up like this
and I'm giving you Health.

412
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:51,965
No. Not even in jest.

413
00:25:57,805 --> 00:25:59,565
Lane Hole.

414
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,165
That's gotta be
his porn name, hasn't it?

415
00:26:02,325 --> 00:26:05,125
This is the bloke
who cleaned my old man out.

416
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:13,285
What do you think about us
getting married and having a child?

417
00:26:15,685 --> 00:26:17,165
Pardon?

418
00:26:18,165 --> 00:26:20,525
Seeing the Nankervis family today,

419
00:26:20,685 --> 00:26:25,605
how much they loved him,
how rich his life was because of family.

420
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:29,365
Yeah, uh...well, you also
met my family today.

421
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:32,165
You wouldn't describe that as rich.

422
00:26:33,365 --> 00:26:36,525
We die. That's what struck me today.

423
00:26:36,685 --> 00:26:39,325
Without loved ones,
it's all bullshit, Cleave.

424
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:48,645
Fucking Keith Nankervis.

425
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:01,805
Autumn leaves, hey?

426
00:27:01,965 --> 00:27:06,925
Still, wouldn't be any kind of year
without them brightening our days.

427
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:08,645
I guess not.

428
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:15,045
A layer of scraps, leaves,
some fertiliser, seaweed —

429
00:27:15,205 --> 00:27:16,725
perfect compost!

430
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:21,325
Speaking of which,
I'm looking for a Lane Hole.

431
00:27:21,485 --> 00:27:25,365
A lot of people doing that.
He lives above me, in number two.

432
00:27:28,205 --> 00:27:30,965
You have yourself a terrific day.

433
00:27:37,685 --> 00:27:41,605
I take it you are
the delightfully named Lane Hole?

434
00:27:41,765 --> 00:27:43,365
Yes.

435
00:27:43,525 --> 00:27:47,085
I believe you saw fit
to defraud my father, Errol Greene,

436
00:27:47,245 --> 00:27:48,725
of his share portfolio.

437
00:27:48,885 --> 00:27:50,645
Your father signed the papers.

438
00:27:50,805 --> 00:27:54,245
Yeah, while he was in care, and
for a third of what they were worth.

439
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:56,645
What sort of pond scum are you?

440
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:58,645
He was of sound mind.

441
00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:01,885
Listen. Listen, mate.
Let me be crystal clear about this.

442
00:28:02,045 --> 00:28:05,805
I am a criminal barrister
of considerable standing.

443
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:07,645
I win the unwinnables.

444
00:28:07,805 --> 00:28:10,485
If you think you can cheat my family
and walk away untouched,

445
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:12,445
you are seriously fuckin' deluded.

446
00:28:12,605 --> 00:28:14,605
Would you excuse me, please.

447
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:18,725
You have unleashed
a force of nature here, pal.

448
00:28:18,885 --> 00:28:20,965
If you don't make
immediate recompense,

449
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:24,285
I will fuckin' crucify you in court.

450
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:25,765
OK.

451
00:28:26,765 --> 00:28:28,405
So you'll pay back the money?

452
00:28:28,565 --> 00:28:30,165
OK.

453
00:28:30,325 --> 00:28:33,325
OK, what?
OK, see you in court.

454
00:28:33,485 --> 00:28:35,845
Oh. OK, then.

455
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,045
You bet you will.

456
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:44,325
Who's gonna be the best guy
for this?

457
00:28:44,485 --> 00:28:47,045
Treadwell? Morrison? Eddington?

458
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:48,765
No, mate.
It's gotta be Dominic Rose.

459
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:51,165
Dominic Rose?
Is he back from the UK?

460
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:53,285
Yeah, almost a year now.

461
00:28:53,445 --> 00:28:56,725
Dominic Rose. Jesus, Barnyard.

462
00:28:56,885 --> 00:29:01,365
Some excruciatingly boring people
are almost interesting for being that,

463
00:29:01,525 --> 00:29:03,405
but Dominic Rose is like the...

464
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:07,045
..he's like the distilled
essence of boredom.

465
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:09,325
He's tedium in its purest form.

466
00:29:09,485 --> 00:29:11,925
Yeah, you told him that once.
Shit, did 1?

467
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:15,125
Yeah, at a bar and bench party
about 15 years ago.

468
00:29:15,285 --> 00:29:18,125
Oh, fuck. Oh, yeah.

469
00:29:18,285 --> 00:29:20,645
Oh, well, he wouldn't remember that.

470
00:29:20,805 --> 00:29:24,045
Listen, I have got to beat
this Hole prick.

471
00:29:24,205 --> 00:29:26,725
Can you dig up whatever you can find
on the little worm, please?

472
00:29:26,885 --> 00:29:30,045
Of course, Cleave. I've got
nothing else to do with my time.

473
00:29:30,205 --> 00:29:31,365
Come on, mate.

474
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:33,805
Send Dominic a decent bottle
of plonk, hmm?

475
00:29:33,965 --> 00:29:35,485
That's the way to his heart.

476
00:29:35,645 --> 00:29:36,925
Hey.

477
00:29:37,085 --> 00:29:39,125
Nicole!
Hey, you didn't text me back.

478
00:29:39,285 --> 00:29:40,845
Yeah. Just got caught up.

479
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:44,085
Sorry.
Alright, no problem. Friend.

480
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:47,325
We are friends, right?
We are, I promise.

481
00:29:48,565 --> 00:29:51,445
I've just been flat out.
Mmm. Sure.

482
00:29:51,605 --> 00:29:53,845
You know. I'll...I'll see ya.
Alright, yep.

483
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:55,565
See you.
Nicole!

484
00:29:58,165 --> 00:30:02,045
I need you to get in touch with the
7:30 Evening Tomorrow Project'.

485
00:30:02,205 --> 00:30:06,205
What? What are you talking about?
The...the current affairs show.

486
00:30:06,365 --> 00:30:09,565
And hook me up a little chat with
the hot one, Polly something.

487
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,125
Not the sanctimonious drone
with the eyebrows...

488
00:30:12,285 --> 00:30:14,245
What am I, your pimp?

489
00:30:27,045 --> 00:30:29,165
- I'll see you Saturday.
- Thank you for that.

490
00:30:29,325 --> 00:30:31,565
Perfect. You've got my number?
Yes.

491
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:39,589
http://hiqve.com/

492
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:55,045
Dominic Rose!

493
00:30:55,205 --> 00:30:58,605
As I live and breathe.
How bloody wonderful to see you.

494
00:30:58,765 --> 00:31:01,925
Hello, Cleaver.
How long has it been, mate?

495
00:31:03,005 --> 00:31:05,325
Bar and bench Christmas party,
about 15 years ago.

496
00:31:05,485 --> 00:31:08,405
That's too long. Too long.

497
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:11,485
You told me I was the San Andreas
Fault line of boredom,

498
00:31:11,645 --> 00:31:14,565
any less interesting
and you'd disappear into a coma.

499
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:16,565
Oh, mate.

500
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:19,125
Oh, mate.

501
00:31:19,285 --> 00:31:21,645
I-'m so sorry about that.

502
00:31:21,805 --> 00:31:25,845
The medication,
lashing out. Bleak period.

503
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:29,525
I don't know how many close friends
I hurt through that time.

504
00:31:29,685 --> 00:31:32,765
How can I...how can I make it right?

505
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:34,685
Goodbye, Cleaver.

506
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:37,245
It's actually
an incredible coincidence,

507
00:31:37,405 --> 00:31:39,685
because I was...I was just
thinking about you the other day.

508
00:31:39,845 --> 00:31:40,965
Oh, really?
Yeah.

509
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:46,045
Because I've got a mate who gave me
a bottle of '71 Grange for my birthday.

510
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:49,125
The '71, you say?
Yeah.

511
00:31:49,285 --> 00:31:52,365
And I was thinking,
who on earth do I know

512
00:31:52,525 --> 00:31:55,845
who...who would really appreciate
a wine like this?

513
00:31:56,005 --> 00:31:57,405
And I thought of you.

514
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:10,645
Ah, there you are.

515
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,005
Dominic, uh...

516
00:32:15,165 --> 00:32:18,765
It's, uh...lovely of you to have me.

517
00:32:18,925 --> 00:32:20,845
Come in, come in.
Ah.

518
00:32:28,685 --> 00:32:33,165
Oh, no! I can't...
I grabbed the wrong bottle.

519
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,805
Miriam.

520
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:41,885
Cleaver, how lovely to see you.

521
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,405
He didn't bring it.
Told you.

522
00:32:46,045 --> 00:32:49,365
The trouble with a lot of your
more erotic women's underwear

523
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:52,685
is it doesn't allow for the male hip —
it's constantly sagging.

524
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,085
For some time now I have been
buying my women's underwear

525
00:32:55,245 --> 00:32:56,605
online from France.

526
00:32:56,765 --> 00:32:58,085
Ooh.
Ah.

527
00:32:58,245 --> 00:33:00,165
Shall I be mother?
Yes, darling.

528
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:02,965
It's just a simple chateaubriand.

529
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:08,925
But the sauce is an authentic
Napoleonic recipe.

530
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:10,245
Ah.

531
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:15,045
The meat — Tenterfield, grass-fed.

532
00:33:15,205 --> 00:33:17,645
Ah, Tenterfield, grass.

533
00:33:17,805 --> 00:33:22,285
And the tiniest hit
of Armagnac in the butter.

534
00:33:22,445 --> 00:33:23,485
Mmmm.

535
00:33:23,645 --> 00:33:26,365
Oh, it looks like
a vision of heaven, mate.

536
00:33:27,365 --> 00:33:31,925
Uh, I came across a case
the other day that'd interest you.

537
00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:36,045
It's this, uh...it's this Lance...

538
00:33:36,205 --> 00:33:38,845
Oh, what? Oh, no, wait — Lane Hole.

539
00:33:39,005 --> 00:33:41,165
I'm familiar with him.

540
00:33:41,325 --> 00:33:44,365
Makes a big living dicing up
the elderly and infirm.

541
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:47,845
Sails close but technically
never breaks the law.

542
00:33:48,005 --> 00:33:49,325
Really?
Mmm.

543
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:55,885
ASIC have prosecuted him
half a dozen times under 183

544
00:33:56,045 --> 00:33:57,925
but failed every time.

545
00:33:58,085 --> 00:34:00,685
183?
Potato?

546
00:34:00,845 --> 00:34:02,005
Interesting.

547
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:04,765
Oh!
Shit. Shit.

548
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:06,845
God, it's a Janet Brown original.
God, I'm sorry.

549
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:08,765
I'm sorry, mate.
Get a cloth. Get a cloth.

550
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:11,405
We need some salt.
I know, salt.

551
00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:14,125
No, not salt. You'll stain it.
It's silk.

552
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:19,605
Polly Nesbitt's in your office.
Who?

553
00:34:19,765 --> 00:34:21,405
You know,
that hack reporter you fancy.

554
00:34:21,565 --> 00:34:22,885
Oh, great.

555
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:24,765
Uh, can you get me a copy

556
00:34:24,925 --> 00:34:27,765
of Section 183
of the Corporations Act, please.

557
00:34:27,925 --> 00:34:29,245
How do I look?

558
00:34:29,405 --> 00:34:31,845
Like someone who's
spent their life in rehab?

559
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:44,085
Tim, I know you think I have
a diverse practice, mate,

560
00:34:44,245 --> 00:34:47,245
but I cannot get over
to the Congo again.

561
00:34:49,805 --> 00:34:54,565
And I cannot keep putting out these
political bushfires for you, mate.

562
00:34:58,925 --> 00:35:02,845
Let...let me just
deal with Burma first, OK,

563
00:35:03,005 --> 00:35:04,885
and then I'll try
and come over and join you.

564
00:35:05,045 --> 00:35:06,925
Alright, see ya.

565
00:35:08,045 --> 00:35:09,605
Polly, how are you?

566
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:12,205
The Congo, huh?
Yep.

567
00:35:12,365 --> 00:35:13,685
Been there?

568
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,725
Yeah, I was Africa correspondent
with CNN for two years.

569
00:35:16,885 --> 00:35:19,365
Where do you stay
when you're in Kinshasa?

570
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:22,885
Kinshasa Hilton.

571
00:35:25,205 --> 00:35:27,685
I'm very time-poor, Mr Greene,

572
00:35:27,845 --> 00:35:29,405
so is this a laughable attempt
at seduction,

573
00:35:29,565 --> 00:35:31,445
or are you prepared
to make a deal?

574
00:35:33,445 --> 00:35:36,485
Well, that's actually
quite a complex question.

575
00:35:36,645 --> 00:35:38,445
I wouldn't have thought so.

576
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:40,885
Is Melissa prepared to go on camera?

577
00:35:41,885 --> 00:35:43,285
She might be.

578
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:46,045
But she's a very skittish
sort of a person,

579
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:49,405
and you need to win her trust.

580
00:35:51,085 --> 00:35:53,045
And how do I do that?

581
00:35:53,205 --> 00:36:00,005
Well, the thing is, Melissa
was very fond of my father.

582
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:05,205
Mr Hole, if you have
nothing to hide,

583
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:07,565
then why can't you answer
a couple of simple questions?

584
00:36:07,725 --> 00:36:10,605
Did you try and coerce a dying man
into giving over his life savings

585
00:36:10,765 --> 00:36:12,445
just weeks before his death?

586
00:36:13,485 --> 00:36:16,485
Mr Hole, why won't you answer?

587
00:36:16,645 --> 00:36:19,765
Mr Hole. Oh! Fuck!

588
00:36:19,925 --> 00:36:21,645
- Fuck, my foot.
- You right?

589
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,205
Oh, shit.

590
00:36:23,365 --> 00:36:28,805
When my Ken died, this man came
and I signed some document,

591
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:30,885
but I didn't know what I was doing.

592
00:36:31,045 --> 00:36:35,965
I lost my home and everything that
Ken and me had worked so hard for.

593
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:42,565
I have devoted my life
to seeking justice.

594
00:36:42,725 --> 00:36:44,925
Here, the Congo, it doesn't matter.

595
00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:48,485
Injustice, wherever it happens,
IS unacceptable to me.

596
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:50,045
Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up.

597
00:36:50,205 --> 00:36:51,885
When the hell did he
ever go to Africa?

598
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:54,165
I have done this to the detriment
of my own career,

599
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:57,525
and sometimes, sadly,
to the detriment of my own family.

600
00:36:57,685 --> 00:37:01,525
Dad's saving the world again.
Oh, shit, he's not, is he?

601
00:37:01,685 --> 00:37:04,045
..I missed a great injustice
in my own home.

602
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:09,725
My father prided himself
on being an ordinary, decent man

603
00:37:09,885 --> 00:37:12,805
who worked daily to put food
on the table for us kids

604
00:37:12,965 --> 00:37:15,405
and to teach us the worth
of human values.

605
00:37:15,565 --> 00:37:18,525
You stole that straight
from Keith Nankervis's funeral.

606
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:20,525
No!
Yes, you did.

607
00:37:20,685 --> 00:37:23,685
..scum like Lane Hole
must not be allowed to sully it.

608
00:37:23,845 --> 00:37:26,405
The question is,
can Cleaver Greene —

609
00:37:26,565 --> 00:37:28,485
a man known for defending
lost causes —

610
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:30,645
find justice for his family?

611
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:32,325
Mahatma Gandhi said once,

612
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:36,165
“The human voice can never reach
the distance that is covered

613
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:39,765
“by the still, small voice
of conscience.”

614
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:46,005
Well, there sits a man
who has no such small voice —

615
00:37:46,165 --> 00:37:51,805
his is a loud blare
of deceit and duplicity.

616
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:58,405
Lane Hole has faced no fewer
than 14 similar charges.

617
00:37:58,565 --> 00:38:02,165
Prior to my father,
he succeeded in conning

618
00:38:02,325 --> 00:38:05,205
some 23 pensioners and invalids

619
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:08,525
out of their income
and out of their family homes.

620
00:38:08,685 --> 00:38:12,125
He robbed my father, on his deathbed,

621
00:38:12,285 --> 00:38:17,485
of a lifetime of diligent saving
and wise investment.

622
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:21,605
But I speak today not only
on behalf of my family,

623
00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:25,525
but on behalf of all those people
who have been injured

624
00:38:25,685 --> 00:38:29,285
by this cruel and indifferent man.

625
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:31,925
It is time to put an end

626
00:38:32,085 --> 00:38:37,885
to Lane Hole's relentless pursuit
of the weak and the vulnerable.

627
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:42,325
Mr Hole?

628
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:45,805
Your Honour, this matter
falls within the provisions

629
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:48,565
of Section 183
of the relevant legislation.

630
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:50,045
Yes.

631
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:51,485
Mr Greene?

632
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:56,925
Your Honour,
Section 183 of the act

633
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,125
clearly provides for remedies

634
00:38:59,285 --> 00:39:03,845
for those who have been injured
by such malfeasance or neglect.

635
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:06,645
Mr Greene, are you
seriously suggesting

636
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:10,805
that Section 183
contemplates remedy?

637
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:14,645
Your Honour, I am holding the act
as we speak.

638
00:39:14,805 --> 00:39:18,045
Mr Greene, you appear to be
holding the Corporations Act.

639
00:39:18,205 --> 00:39:19,805
Indeed I am, Your Honour.

640
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:23,845
The Section 183
to which Mr Hole refers

641
00:39:24,005 --> 00:39:25,765
is the Commercial
and Financial Trading,

642
00:39:25,925 --> 00:39:29,925
Act
of 1998.

643
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:37,565
And I am aware of that,
Your Honour...

644
00:39:39,045 --> 00:39:41,125
..but in a broader context...

645
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:43,805
There is no broader context,
Mr Greene.

646
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,925
The High Court has
made it abundantly clear.

647
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:51,765
Your Honour, this is a case
where justice itself is on trial.

648
00:39:51,925 --> 00:39:58,605
No, the only thing on trial here is
whether 183 applies, and it does.

649
00:39:58,765 --> 00:40:00,365
Your Honour, I have witnesses,

650
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:03,285
I have people whose lives
have been destroyed.

651
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:08,005
You may well have those,
but you don't have 183.

652
00:40:08,165 --> 00:40:11,405
Anything else before
I find for the defendant

653
00:40:11,565 --> 00:40:14,405
and award costs against you,
Mr Greene?

654
00:40:33,645 --> 00:40:35,205
I could have done that.

655
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:37,845
And don't even think
of hitting us up for costs.

656
00:40:39,085 --> 00:40:40,565
Lily.

657
00:40:52,045 --> 00:40:54,725
That was a pretty short
crusade in all.

658
00:40:55,725 --> 00:40:58,485
Must have been all that time
you spent in the Congo.

659
00:41:01,565 --> 00:41:03,285
But I did love the Gandhi.

660
00:41:15,365 --> 00:41:17,245
Do me here.

661
00:41:17,405 --> 00:41:19,685
Someone will come.
Oh, good.

662
00:41:22,885 --> 00:41:23,965
Ooh.

663
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:25,725
Justin?

664
00:41:27,165 --> 00:41:29,765
Jesus Christ.
You slut.

665
00:41:29,925 --> 00:41:33,085
You bloody little whore,
bastard, bitch!

666
00:41:33,245 --> 00:41:34,645
Get out, Justin.
What?

667
00:41:34,805 --> 00:41:37,645
Is this piece of shit gonna make me?
Listen...

668
00:41:37,805 --> 00:41:40,965
Oh, it's Justin what's-his-name,
from your show.

669
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:44,045
Don't make me call the police.
You broke my heart, Pol.

670
00:41:44,205 --> 00:41:47,205
You just tore it from my chest
and you trampled on it.

671
00:41:47,365 --> 00:41:51,565
Please?
Please, I beg you, come back.

672
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:53,245
No, no, no. Come on, mate.

673
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,605
Oh, shit.

674
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:03,365
Shit! That's my favourite.

675
00:42:06,365 --> 00:42:07,885
Don't ask.

676
00:42:08,045 --> 00:42:12,125
We were sort of engaged and
I had this fling with his best friend.

677
00:42:12,285 --> 00:42:14,165
You know how it is.
Uh-huh.

678
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:16,445
But he will not move on.

679
00:42:17,525 --> 00:42:19,005
I need a drink.

680
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:29,525
I have met some walking sink hair
in my time, but Lane Hole...

681
00:42:29,685 --> 00:42:31,085
Oh, boo-hoo.

682
00:42:31,245 --> 00:42:35,125
A man who defends rapists
and cannibals now cries foul?

683
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:38,645
There's a moral dimension
to everything, you know.

684
00:42:38,805 --> 00:42:42,085
There's no such thing as morality,
only personal choice.

685
00:42:42,245 --> 00:42:44,845
Read Sartre and then read Camus.

686
00:42:45,005 --> 00:42:47,245
Oh, fuck Camus.

687
00:42:47,405 --> 00:42:50,325
The world is full of creeps.
What are you gonna do?

688
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,685
You gonna knock off
all the Lane Holes in the world?

689
00:42:52,845 --> 00:42:54,405
Yes, I might just do that.

690
00:42:54,565 --> 00:42:58,925
Get rid of Lane Hole,
then you and me, we're out of work.

691
00:42:59,085 --> 00:43:01,565
The Lane Holes are our lifeblood.

692
00:43:03,925 --> 00:43:08,885
Well, I have to find a way of dealing
with this particular Lane Hole.

693
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:11,725
I just haven't
figured out how yet.

694
00:43:11,885 --> 00:43:14,645
Been to the court of public opinion,

695
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:17,925
been to the court of Section 183.

696
00:43:18,085 --> 00:43:20,965
I know the law's an ass.
So just plug him.

697
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:22,925
You know anyone?

698
00:43:23,085 --> 00:43:25,485
Plug him?
Mmm.

699
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,645
Oh, are you Bogart now?

700
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:30,685
It's Lauren Bacall, actually.
‘Big Sleep'.

701
00:43:32,765 --> 00:43:34,725
Nice reference.

702
00:43:42,685 --> 00:43:46,525
Oh, what the hell?
You owe me, Col.

703
00:43:46,685 --> 00:43:48,925
If it wasn't for me...
Go home to bloody bed, Cleave.

704
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:53,285
Listen.. listen, Col,
You...you're happy, right?

705
00:43:53,445 --> 00:43:55,325
Yes!
Yes? Yes?

706
00:43:55,485 --> 00:43:59,205
State of bliss? Pigs in shit? Alright.

707
00:43:59,365 --> 00:44:06,045
Well, this is the name of the guy
who stole my father's money, right?

708
00:44:06,205 --> 00:44:07,525
Lane Hole.

709
00:44:07,685 --> 00:44:10,685
That's his name, number, address,
everything you need to know.

710
00:44:10,845 --> 00:44:14,805
You sort him out and
all of our problems will go away.

711
00:44:14,965 --> 00:44:17,645
What, you want me to whack this guy?
No! No.

712
00:44:17,805 --> 00:44:21,965
Not whack. Do not whack
under any circumstances.

713
00:44:22,125 --> 00:44:25,445
Just, you know, ruffle his feathers
a little bit,

714
00:44:25,605 --> 00:44:27,565
give him a little pinch on the arse,

715
00:44:27,725 --> 00:44:33,685
let him know that nobody steals
from me, except for my secretary.

716
00:44:33,845 --> 00:44:36,325
- But I know all about that.
- Collie Wobbles.

717
00:44:36,485 --> 00:44:37,965
Who the fuck is it?

718
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:42,125
Mate, he stole from my father.

719
00:44:42,285 --> 00:44:44,485
Alright?
OK, Cleave.

720
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:45,805
Do you get it?
Yeah.

721
00:44:45,965 --> 00:44:48,845
You tell Lane Hole from me, mate,

722
00:44:49,005 --> 00:44:55,645
that Cleaver Greene is every bit
as good as Keith Nankervis,

723
00:44:55,805 --> 00:45:00,125
even if my dad never thought so.

724
00:45:14,725 --> 00:45:17,125
I take it you've not read this.

725
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:19,245
No.

726
00:45:19,405 --> 00:45:22,085
Mrs Dunstan said
Adam read it out for Show and Tell.

727
00:45:22,245 --> 00:45:25,525
Oh, sorry I'm late.

728
00:45:31,845 --> 00:45:35,005
I'm just trying
to set the record straight.

729
00:45:39,725 --> 00:45:42,165
You should see the way
that they look at me.

730
00:45:42,325 --> 00:45:45,165
The way who looks at you?
The mothers at the gate.

731
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,965
Friends of yours, are they?

732
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,485
No, not really.

733
00:45:49,645 --> 00:45:51,885
Then why on earth
do you care what they think?

734
00:46:02,285 --> 00:46:03,965
Oh!

735
00:46:05,045 --> 00:46:06,525
Oh...

736
00:46:14,365 --> 00:46:16,805
Col, if you're there, pick up.

737
00:46:17,925 --> 00:46:19,325
Come on, pick up.

738
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,005
I've got a vague memory.

739
00:46:22,165 --> 00:46:27,645
Look, just...f-forget
what I asked for, OK?

740
00:46:27,805 --> 00:46:30,565
Don't touch Lane Hole, alright?

741
00:46:30,725 --> 00:46:34,365
It was the booze talking.
I want nothing done to him.

742
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:36,565
Oh, just there.
Call off your dogs.

743
00:46:36,725 --> 00:46:39,605
OK? I was barking, yes?

744
00:46:39,765 --> 00:46:40,765
Ooh!

745
00:46:42,565 --> 00:46:45,845
I crossed the line, almost.

746
00:46:46,005 --> 00:46:51,125
Last night, for one horrible, insane
moment, I lost control of my life.

747
00:46:51,285 --> 00:46:54,125
You don't honestly think there's only
been one moment, do you?

748
00:46:54,285 --> 00:46:57,205
I sought revenge.
Can you believe it?

749
00:46:57,365 --> 00:47:00,405
God, thank...thank God I saw reason.

750
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:02,405
You mean you sobered up?

751
00:47:02,565 --> 00:47:05,765
The fact I was pissed
doesn't make it intrinsically wrong.

752
00:47:05,925 --> 00:47:08,925
I've often been pissed
and made excellent choices.

753
00:47:09,085 --> 00:47:11,525
Again, another dazzling moment
of self-awareness.

754
00:47:11,685 --> 00:47:13,885
Christ, it's all so tenuous,
isn't it?

755
00:47:14,045 --> 00:47:17,205
Fuzz really wants you to go with him
to a prayer meeting.

756
00:47:17,365 --> 00:47:20,125
They're singing
Christian Socialists.

757
00:47:20,285 --> 00:47:22,565
I'd rather have a tetanus shot.
Why do I have to go?

758
00:47:22,725 --> 00:47:24,605
Because, Cleaver, this is
not my department, OK?

759
00:47:24,765 --> 00:47:27,045
This is father-son stuff and...

760
00:47:27,205 --> 00:47:29,845
What do you mean, father-son stuff?
It's about sex.

761
00:47:30,005 --> 00:47:32,245
What do you mean, it's about sex?
She's a virgin.

762
00:47:32,405 --> 00:47:34,565
She won't have sex with him
until they're married.

763
00:47:34,725 --> 00:47:36,325
Well, that's not gonna happen
any time soon.

764
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:38,165
Of course it is. That's her power.

765
00:47:38,325 --> 00:47:40,325
Have you seen
her pert little bottom?

766
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:41,565
Mmm.
Mmm.

767
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,365
Can you imagine
how frustrated he is?

768
00:47:43,525 --> 00:47:45,725
Mmm.
Ask me how old her parents are.

769
00:47:45,885 --> 00:47:47,365
How old are...
36 years old.

770
00:47:47,525 --> 00:47:49,085
Much younger
and we could have had them.

771
00:47:49,245 --> 00:47:51,965
They got married at 18.
That's what faith does to people.

772
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:53,525
They marry young
because they're sex-starved.

773
00:47:53,685 --> 00:47:57,445
Just show him that you have
an open mind and he'll listen to you.

774
00:47:57,605 --> 00:48:00,285
Alright, alright. OK. I'll...I'll go.

775
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:04,405
I'll invoke Satan's name,
do a 360 head-spin.

776
00:48:04,565 --> 00:48:06,045
Thank you.

777
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:11,325
How are things with Roget?
Pretty good.

778
00:48:11,485 --> 00:48:14,525
Ooh, pretty good.

779
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:18,125
How's Missy doing?
Missy wants to get married.

780
00:48:19,645 --> 00:48:21,845
To you?
Yeah.

781
00:48:23,045 --> 00:48:25,885
Oh, now I think she needs
to be hospitalised.

782
00:48:26,045 --> 00:48:27,445
Did you read that flyer?

783
00:48:33,845 --> 00:48:36,125
Don't mind me.
I don't mean to interrupt.

784
00:48:36,285 --> 00:48:38,165
Bronwyn was just telling us

785
00:48:38,325 --> 00:48:40,485
that she and Malcolm have
bought a house at Pearl Beach.

786
00:48:40,645 --> 00:48:41,965
Lovely. Congratulations.

787
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:45,125
Yes, well, you know, it's always been
a bit of a dream.

788
00:48:45,285 --> 00:48:47,605
Of course the next nine months
are gonna be a nightmare.

789
00:48:47,765 --> 00:48:50,565
Will they? How so?
We're doing a bit of a reno.

790
00:48:50,725 --> 00:48:53,445
Because it's just a shack right now,
doesn't even have internet.

791
00:48:53,605 --> 00:48:55,645
So we're gonna have to
furnish and decorate,

792
00:48:55,805 --> 00:48:57,645
and Malcolm's got
his heart set on Hockneys.

793
00:48:57,805 --> 00:49:01,005
I don't know what that's about,
for a beach house.

794
00:49:01,165 --> 00:49:04,005
We had the most awful fight
about it last night.

795
00:49:04,165 --> 00:49:06,805
You poor thing.
Yeah, you poor thing.

796
00:49:06,965 --> 00:49:10,125
That sounds like a real nightmare.
Mmm.

797
00:49:10,285 --> 00:49:13,205
A real fucking nightmare.

798
00:49:14,205 --> 00:49:15,685
Have you all got beach houses?

799
00:49:17,045 --> 00:49:19,765
This is like a cancer cluster.

800
00:49:19,925 --> 00:49:22,925
I never realised
how lucky my family was

801
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,445
to have been spared
a nightmare like that.

802
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,365
Oh, my grandmother was in Belsen
for a couple of months

803
00:49:29,525 --> 00:49:31,285
when she was a young girl.

804
00:49:31,445 --> 00:49:33,245
Sans Hockneys, by the way.

805
00:49:33,405 --> 00:49:38,445
Are you quite done, Scarlet?
You know...I think I am.

806
00:49:40,925 --> 00:49:43,685
Residents of Sydney's
southern suburbs are reeling

807
00:49:43,845 --> 00:49:45,805
with the brutal murder
of a pensioner.

808
00:49:45,965 --> 00:49:50,805
Albert Platt had lived among these
shady trees and streets for 50 years

809
00:49:50,965 --> 00:49:54,645
till a senseless act of violence
brought his life to an end.

810
00:49:54,805 --> 00:49:57,605
What an angry and frightened community
wants to know...

811
00:49:57,765 --> 00:49:59,245
Oh, Jesus.
..Is what sort of monster...

812
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:00,805
..Is out there preying on...
Oh, no.

813
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:02,285
..on the elderly and infirm.
What?

814
00:50:02,445 --> 00:50:04,565
Oh, please, tell me
it's a coincidence.

815
00:50:04,725 --> 00:50:05,805
A police spokesman said

816
00:50:05,965 --> 00:50:07,765
they were pursuing
several lines of inquiry...

817
00:50:07,925 --> 00:50:11,245
- Tell me you got my message.
- Your message?

818
00:50:11,405 --> 00:50:13,805
Oh, right, the one
cancelling the hit?

819
00:50:13,965 --> 00:50:16,445
It was never a hit.
It was a pinch, remember?

820
00:50:16,605 --> 00:50:18,245
Yeah, yeah, I got the message.

821
00:50:18,405 --> 00:50:20,085
So you didn't go?
No.

822
00:50:20,245 --> 00:50:21,965
Oh, thank God.

823
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:23,525
Oh, thank God.

824
00:50:23,685 --> 00:50:25,405
I subbed it out.

825
00:50:25,565 --> 00:50:26,885
You what?

826
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:29,525
I was, you know, busy
so I subbed it out.

827
00:50:29,685 --> 00:50:31,685
You...you subbed what out?

828
00:50:33,205 --> 00:50:37,765
You mean you told somebody else
to visit Lane Hole?

829
00:50:37,925 --> 00:50:40,685
Mate, we sub out
a lot of work in our game.

830
00:50:40,845 --> 00:50:44,925
Is...is there any...any possibility

831
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:49,925
that your friend may have visited
the wrong friend?

832
00:50:50,085 --> 00:50:53,405
Dunno. Never had him
visit friends before.

833
00:50:53,565 --> 00:50:56,845
Oh, fuck. Oh, Jesus.

834
00:50:57,005 --> 00:50:58,885
Oh, my God.

835
00:50:59,045 --> 00:51:01,725
Oh.
Mate, why are you so stressed?

836
00:51:01,885 --> 00:51:04,765
Oh, apart from the fact that

837
00:51:04,925 --> 00:51:10,405
a lovely old leaf-raking man living in
the flat below our friend is dead,

838
00:51:10,565 --> 00:51:12,245
you mean, ignoring that, Col?

839
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:15,845
I'm a little concerned that
I was filmed on national television

840
00:51:16,005 --> 00:51:18,805
threatening the man who lives
in the flat above him.

841
00:51:18,965 --> 00:51:20,845
Do you understand?

842
00:51:21,005 --> 00:51:24,765
And I'm a little worried that
your work experience pal

843
00:51:24,925 --> 00:51:29,685
might be so FUCKING THICK
that he went to the wrong flat!

844
00:51:32,805 --> 00:51:34,285
Oh, shit.

845
00:51:49,605 --> 00:51:51,685
- Is Mr Greene in?
- Yes.

846
00:51:51,845 --> 00:51:55,205
Mr Greene, I'm so sorry.

847
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:58,885
It was a breakdown in communication,
partly me, partly him.

848
00:51:59,045 --> 00:52:00,365
Who are you?

849
00:52:00,525 --> 00:52:04,245
I'm a friend of Col
and Kirsty's, you know.

850
00:52:04,405 --> 00:52:10,365
Oh. Please tell me what I think
happened didn't happen.

851
00:52:10,525 --> 00:52:13,925
It won't happen again, you have
my absolute assurance on that.

852
00:52:14,085 --> 00:52:16,765
Can I ask you not to make
a big deal of this?

853
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,405
What?

854
00:52:18,565 --> 00:52:22,805
I'm trying to set myself up in a new
town, make the right connections.

855
00:52:22,965 --> 00:52:25,285
A mistake like this
could set me right back.

856
00:52:25,445 --> 00:52:29,165
So what say no charge,
and we'll forget it.

857
00:52:29,325 --> 00:52:32,485
No charge.

858
00:52:36,645 --> 00:52:39,645
No charge.

859
00:52:42,165 --> 00:52:44,765
Oh, Jesus Christ!

860
00:52:46,645 --> 00:52:48,205
It's the Rapture.

861
00:52:50,325 --> 00:52:54,485
When I was, like, 14,
I was a real mess, just like you,

862
00:52:54,645 --> 00:52:57,805
and I fought Jesus all the way,
I mean, I wouldn't let him in.

863
00:52:57,965 --> 00:53:01,685
Here was this guy who'd lived
this sinless life full of love,

864
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,725
and, you know,
he died on a cross for us,

865
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:06,725
and I just thought, “How do
I compete with that,” you know?

866
00:53:06,885 --> 00:53:09,965
But then he came
and he spoke into my heart,

867
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:12,205
“I forgive you everything, Tara.

868
00:53:12,365 --> 00:53:15,685
“Leave your sins behind
and come and walk with me.”

869
00:53:15,845 --> 00:53:22,045
And I fell to my knees and I said,
“I am yours, Lord. Take me to you.”

870
00:53:22,205 --> 00:53:25,285
And I was reborn.

871
00:53:25,445 --> 00:53:27,645
Praise the Lord.
You alright, Dad?

872
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:29,245
