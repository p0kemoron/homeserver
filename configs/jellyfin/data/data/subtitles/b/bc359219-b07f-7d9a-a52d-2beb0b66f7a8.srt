1
00:01:15,327 --> 00:01:17,795
Tell me, General. Where's the hotline?

2
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:20,435
- Which one?
- The one to Russia.

3
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:22,677
The red hotline, sir.

4
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:24,997
It's in Downing Street.

5
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:28,477
- I can get through to the Soviet president?
- Theoretically, yes.

6
00:01:28,647 --> 00:01:31,639
- Theoretically?
- That's what we tell journalists.

7
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:36,198
We did once get through to the Kremlin,
but only to a switchboard operator.

8
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:41,157
- Couldn't the operator put you through?
- Never found out. Didn't speak much English.

9
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:43,795
- How often is it tested?
- Not too often.

10
00:01:43,967 --> 00:01:46,481
It creates unnecessary panic at the other end,

11
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:51,118
and panic is a good thing to avoid
where nuclear weapons are concerned.

12
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:54,040
- Yes.
- Now, this is it.

13
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,238
Ah, good.

14
00:01:57,487 --> 00:02:01,002
- What is it?
- The trigger, Prime Minister.

15
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:03,681
- The trigger?
- The nuclear trigger, the button.

16
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:06,281
- This?
- Indirectly, yes.

17
00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:10,197
This is the telex communication
with HMS Northwood.

18
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:15,805
You send a coded signal and Northwood's
telex operator sends an authentication signal.

19
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:17,998
So he knows it's from you.

20
00:02:18,207 --> 00:02:20,721
When the instruction's been authenticated,

21
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:24,880
Northwood sends a command to a Polaris
submarine and they press the button.

22
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:27,476
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

23
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,161
- When I say so?
- When you say so.

24
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:33,196
Wouldn't anybody argue with me?

25
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,806
Serving officers obey orders without question.

26
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:39,322
What if I were to get drunk?

27
00:02:39,487 --> 00:02:42,684
On the whole, it would be safer if you didn't.

28
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:44,246
Blimey!

29
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:47,399
It's your job and you wanted it, Prime Minister.

30
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:51,355
- Supposing I were to go off my rocker?
- The Cabinet might notice.

31
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:56,317
I wouldn't count on it. Seriously,
supposing I did and then changed my mind?

32
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:59,644
That's all right.
No one would ever know, would they?

33
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:07,076
- How many bombs are there?
- Four Polaris submarines, 16 missiles on each.

34
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:10,199
- But how many actual bombs?
- 192.

35
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:14,241
Each one at least five times the power
of the Hiroshima bomb.

36
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:16,802
You're thinking, ''Not very many.''

37
00:03:17,007 --> 00:03:19,805
I don't know. That seems enough.

38
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:23,761
Not with 1200 Soviet missiles
trained on Britain, waiting to retaliate.

39
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:26,162
- 1200?
- Hmm.

40
00:03:26,327 --> 00:03:30,559
Britain's always fought against the odds -
the Armada, Battle of Britain.

41
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:35,124
Yes, and we'll have a great deal
more firepower when we get Trident.

42
00:03:35,287 --> 00:03:37,755
Thank goodness for conventional forces!

43
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:41,203
They would hold the Russians for at most 72 hours.

44
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:43,398
- Is that all?
- Hmm.

45
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:47,037
So in an emergency,
I would have to make an instant decision?

46
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:50,239
- No, you'd probably have 12 hours.
- 12 hours?

47
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:52,762
Shouldn't we do something about this?

48
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:57,483
Yes, but for 20 years, politicians have said
they can't afford the conventional forces.

49
00:03:57,687 --> 00:04:00,679
Conventional forces are very expensive,
Prime Minister.

50
00:04:00,847 --> 00:04:03,315
Much cheaper just to press a button.

51
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:08,081
So how long should we allow for this meeting?

52
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,317
- 72 hours...
- Fine.

53
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:14,921
It's only the New Zealand High Commissioner.

54
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:18,762
Isn't 72 hours a bit generous?

55
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:23,077
I was just thinking
how long we could hold the Russians.

56
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:27,240
If we persuaded the Americans
to strengthen THEIR conventional forces...

57
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:29,915
I don't think it'll make much difference.

58
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:33,284
The American troops in Germany
are all so drug-ridden,

59
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,961
they don't know which side they're on anyway.

60
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:38,561
And during the last NATO exercises,

61
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:43,118
the U.S. troops dispersed and picnicked
in the woods with lady soldiers.

62
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:49,596
- What about the other NATO armies?
- They're all right. On weekdays, anyway.

63
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:51,320
Weekdays?

64
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:55,002
The Dutch, Danish and Belgian armies
go home for the weekend.

65
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:00,321
So if the Russians are to invade, we'd prefer them
to do it between Mondays and Fridays?

66
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:04,480
- Is this widely known?
- If I know it, I'm sure the Russians do.

67
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:09,482
The Kremlin usually gets NATO information
before it filters through to Number 10.

68
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:14,078
- So it comes back to Trident?
- When it comes.

69
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,715
- If it works.
- If it wor...

70
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:22,360
- What do you mean?
- Normally, when new weapons are delivered,

71
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:25,519
the warheads don't fit the ends of the rockets.

72
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:31,321
That's what happened to Polaris. You know
the sort of thing, wiring faults, microchip failure.

73
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:37,039
We couldn't fire Polaris for some years.
Cruise is probably the same. Trident might be too.

74
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:39,681
We should take the manufacturers to court.

75
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:43,357
We can't risk the publicity -
security and they know it!

76
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:47,315
- We should change the manufacturers.
- We do all the time.

77
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:52,641
The manufacturers know that too. That's why
that torpedo landed on Sandwich golf course.

78
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,642
Sandwich golf course?
I didn't read that in the papers.

79
00:05:57,847 --> 00:06:00,315
0f course not. There was a cover-up.

80
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:05,003
The members just found a new bunker
on the 7th fairway the next morning.

81
00:06:05,927 --> 00:06:10,921
- So the torpedoes don't work either?
- No, only the new ones. The others are fine.

82
00:06:11,607 --> 00:06:14,644
The ones designed during the Second World War.

83
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:17,839
- 0ver 40 years ago?
- They had lots of testing.

84
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:21,204
- You can't afford that with the modern ones.
- Why not?

85
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:26,487
Well, if there's a nuclear war, it won't last
long enough for the weapons to be tested.

86
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:30,202
Are there other things I don't know
about the UK's defence?

87
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:34,844
I don't know, Prime Minister.
I don't know what you don't know.

88
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:40,280
The government's chief scientific adviser
sees the problem differently from the MoD.

89
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:43,923
- I'd like to see him now.
- A late drink might be wiser.

90
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:46,555
Better not to let the Cabinet Office know.

91
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:50,163
Sir Humphrey gets upset.
He doesn't regard him as one of us.

92
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,006
I thought he won the DS0 at Arnhem.

93
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:56,637
That doesn't make up
for speaking with an Austrian accent.

94
00:06:56,807 --> 00:07:00,686
He didn't go to 0xford or Cambridge.
He didn't even go to the LSE.

95
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:07,124
Prime Minister,
you believe in the nuclear deterrent?

96
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,318
- Oh, yes.
- Why?

97
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:11,398
- Pardon?
- Why?

98
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:13,723
Because it deters.

99
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:16,598
- Whom?
- Pardon?

100
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:21,079
- Whom? Whom does it deter?
- The Russians from attacking us.

101
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:22,800
- Why?
- Pardon?

102
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:24,286
Why?

103
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:27,678
They know if they launched an attack,
I'd press the button.

104
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:30,355
- You would?
- Well, wouldn't I?

105
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:32,518
Well, would you?

106
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:35,201
At the last resort, yes, I certainly would.

107
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:38,006
Well, I think I certainly would. Yes.

108
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:43,558
- And what is the last resort?
- If the Russians invaded western Europe.

109
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:48,761
You only have 12 hours to decide, so you're
saying the last resort is the first response?

110
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,804
Am I?

111
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:55,876
You don't need to worry. Why should
the Russians annex the whole of Europe?

112
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:58,515
They can't even control Afghanistan.

113
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:02,642
No, if they try anything,
it will be salami tactics.

114
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:05,315
- Salami tactics?
- Slice by slice.

115
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,556
One small piece at a time.

116
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:12,083
So will you press the button
if they invade West Berlin?

117
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:15,645
- It all depends.
- On what?

118
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:17,838
Scenario one.

119
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:20,915
Riots in West Berlin,

120
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:23,282
buildings in flames.

121
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:28,680
East German fire brigade crosses the border
to help. Would you press the button...?

122
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:33,280
The East German police come with them.
The button...?

123
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:37,480
Then some troops,
more troops just for riot control, they say.

124
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:42,722
And then the East German troops
are replaced by Russian troops. Button...?

125
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,995
Then the Russian troops don't go.

126
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:49,955
They are invited to stay
to support civilian administration.

127
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:54,120
The civilian administration closes roads
and Tempelhof Airport.

128
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:58,237
- Now you press the button?
- I need time to think about it.

129
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:00,796
- You have 12 hours.
- Have I?

130
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:04,164
- You're inventing this.
- You are Prime Minister today.

131
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:07,046
The phone might ring now from NATO HQ.

132
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,477
(PHOnE RINGS)

133
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:14,046
Hello...? Yes. NATO HQ, Prime Minister.

134
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:20,159
Can you address their annual conference in April?

135
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,841
I thought I could. I'm not so sure now.

136
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:24,759
Yes.

137
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,958
Scenario two.

138
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:31,643
The Russian army accidentally on purpose
cross the West German frontier.

139
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:34,196
- Is that the last resort?
- No.

140
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:36,517
Right, scenario three.

141
00:09:36,687 --> 00:09:42,000
Suppose the Russians have invaded
West Germany, Belgium, Holland, France?

142
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:47,161
Suppose their tanks and troops have reached
the English Channel and are poised to invade?

143
00:09:47,327 --> 00:09:49,522
- Is that the last resort?
- No.

144
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:51,200
Why not?

145
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:55,758
We'd only fight a nuclear war to defend ourselves.
That would be committing suicide!

146
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,845
So what is the last resort? Piccadilly?

147
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:02,401
Watford Gap service station?

148
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,637
The Reform Club?

149
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:08,317
- Maybe the nuclear deterrent makes no sense.
- Yes, it does.

150
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:12,480
If the Russians or Americans
have the bomb, so must the other side.

151
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:15,684
- And keep Polaris just in case.
- What are you proposing?

152
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:21,405
Cancel Trident. Spend the £15 billion
you save on conventional forces.

153
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,640
- You wouldn't really press the button.
- I might if I had no choice.

154
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:31,205
They'll never put you in a situation where you
have no choice. They'll stick to salami tactics.

155
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:36,401
Supposing we cancel Trident and channel
£15 billion into conventional forces?

156
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:40,401
- What do we spend it on? Tanks?
- No, we spend it on E.T.

157
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:46,081
Extra-terrestrials?

158
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:48,403
Emergent technology.

159
00:10:51,047 --> 00:10:54,881
- What's that?
- Smart missiles, target finding, infrared.

160
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:58,926
- Who would operate this E.T?
- A large conventional army.

161
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:01,118
A large convention...

162
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:03,357
I've got an idea.

163
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:06,078
Wait a minute!

164
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:10,001
I think I can see how to do this.
First, we cancel Trident.

165
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:12,681
- Yes.
- We don't buy Cruise either.

166
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:15,839
- Yes.
- Then we introduce conscription.

167
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:17,326
Yes.

168
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:22,356
Not only do we solve our defence problems,
we solve our unemployment problems as well.

169
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:25,081
Isn't conscription a courageous policy?

170
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:27,755
Courageous? Oh, my God, is it?

171
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:32,164
No, no.
In times of full employment, it would be.

172
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:36,155
But now we'd just give
unemployed young people something to do.

173
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:40,320
We'd teach them trades and skills.
We might even teach them to read.

174
00:11:40,487 --> 00:11:44,958
The army never discharged anyone
who was illiterate. We could make them wash.

175
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:50,121
We'd give them a comprehensive education
to make up for their comprehensive education.

176
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:57,361
Call it ''national service''. Send the young
people out into the community services.

177
00:11:57,527 --> 00:12:03,045
With one policy, we solve our defence,
educational and unemployment problems.

178
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:06,045
This is wonderful. I see it all now.

179
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:09,995
''A new deal for Britain - Hacker's Grand Design.''

180
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:13,919
From time to time in our great island story,

181
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:16,521
it falls to one man...

182
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:20,119
to lead his people out of the valley of the shadow

183
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:23,643
and into the sunlit uplands
of peace and prosperity.

184
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:29,761
- Why didn't I think of this before?
- Because we only just met.

185
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:35,158
Hello, darling!

186
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:38,235
- What's for lunch?
- You tell me.

187
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,080
- Are you going somewhere?
- Voluntary services committee. I did tell you.

188
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:50,037
Oh, yes, of course. I just thought
a few scrambled eggs or something.

189
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:52,675
I think there's some eggs in the fridge.

190
00:12:52,847 --> 00:12:56,999
- You want me to do it?
- We agreed that I'd carry on with my work.

191
00:12:57,167 --> 00:13:00,682
- Yes, of course.
- Foreign Office telegrams, Prime Minister.

192
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:04,635
- Put them over there.
- It's bad enough living in this goldfish bowl.

193
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:09,881
Every time I want to go out, I have to walk past
a dozen journalists and 50 gawping tourists!

194
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:13,039
- There's no privacy anywhere.
- That's not true.

195
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:17,325
(KN0CKS) Sorry, Prime Minister.
Security check. Can I just look around?

196
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:19,842
- Yes, carry on.
- Privacy?

197
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:24,285
- You can always walk in the garden.
- With about 60 people staring at you!

198
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:29,601
It's like exercising in a prison yard. And we
pay rent for this place. They should pay US!

199
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,759
- At least it's quiet.
- (BRASS BAND PLAYS)

200
00:13:32,927 --> 00:13:36,442
- Usually.
- That's been going on since half past seven!

201
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:39,639
- They've got to practise somewhere.
- Why here?

202
00:13:39,807 --> 00:13:44,437
- That's the Horse Guards' Parade.
- All clear, Prime Minister.

203
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:49,402
Annie, you must realise that a career
in public service involves some sacrifice.

204
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:52,280
Fine, you sacrifice your lunch. I'm late.

205
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:55,276
- I'm hungry!
- Aw!

206
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:59,364
- What did you have for YOur lunch?
- Half a Yorkie bar.

207
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:03,077
Where's the other half?

208
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:08,438
Ah, Bernard!

209
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,639
- Yes, Prime Minister.
- Had a good lunch?

210
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:14,367
- Oh, quite good.
- Where did you have it?

211
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:16,956
- In the Cabinet mess.
- Three courses?

212
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:18,964
Er, yes.

213
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:21,880
- Wine?
- A glass of claret, yes.

214
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:25,639
Would you like to know what I had for my lunch?

215
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:29,396
- Do you want to tell me, Prime Minister?
- Nothing!

216
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,598
Are you dieting?

217
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:36,799
It seems there are facilities for feeding you
and all the private secretaries,

218
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:41,757
the Cabinet Office, the Press Office, the
messengers, but not for me - and I live here!

219
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:45,124
- Can't Mrs Hacker cook for you?
- She's out at work.

220
00:14:45,287 --> 00:14:47,960
- We'll get you a cook.
- Who'll pay for it?

221
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:50,402
- You will.
- How much?

222
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:53,286
- 8,000 to 10,000 a year.
- I can't afford that!

223
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:56,604
- Talk to the Cabinet Secretary.
- Bring him here now.

224
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,760
He's due here any minute. Shall we press on
with the affairs of the nation?

225
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:04,277
Stuff the affairs of the nation. I want a cook!

226
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:08,480
I'll look into it. Malcolm Warren
from the Press Office would like a word.

227
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:10,638
0K, bring him in.

228
00:15:12,487 --> 00:15:16,002
- Good afternoon, Prime Minister.
- Good afternoon, Malcolm.

229
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,601
Could we keep this brief?

230
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:22,965
Yes, two things. First, we'll discuss
your first appearance on TV as Prime Minister.

231
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:28,082
Perhaps we ought to leave it until we've time
to do it thoroughly. What's the other thing?

232
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:31,324
- Your official visit to Washington.
- What about it?

233
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:34,200
- A lot of press want to come.
- Let them.

234
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,881
- It'll be very expensive.
- Malcolm!

235
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:42,201
I shall be standing on the White House lawn
side by side with the President of the USA.

236
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:46,363
National anthems, two world leaders together.

237
00:15:47,287 --> 00:15:50,916
We will tell the world
about our happy relationship,

238
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:53,078
our unity, resolve,

239
00:15:53,247 --> 00:15:57,240
a few words perhaps about my own courage,
wisdom, statesmanship.

240
00:15:57,407 --> 00:16:02,037
Can't you realise how important this is to me?
Well, not to me, to Britain.

241
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:06,283
Our place in the world,
my place in the history books.

242
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:10,241
- Yes, Prime Minister.
- Come in, Humphrey. Thank you, Malcolm.

243
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,762
- Malcolm...
- Humphrey!

244
00:16:14,447 --> 00:16:16,722
- I've been thinking...
- Good.

245
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:23,556
I've been Prime Minister
for, let me see, three days now.

246
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:26,679
And a very good PM you are, too!

247
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:30,436
I'm not fishing for compliments,
though it has been going well.

248
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:32,723
Oh, indeed.

249
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:37,717
It's nice to be able to reward one's old allies.
Was Ron Jones pleased with his peerage?

250
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:41,397
Yes, Prime Minister.
He said his members would be delighted.

251
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:45,196
- His members?
- 0f his union. The National Federation...

252
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:48,638
I didn't mean him. I meant our backbencher!

253
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:52,444
I meant to give a peerage to Ron Jones,
not Ron Jones!

254
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:56,679
Bloody hell!

255
00:16:56,887 --> 00:16:59,765
If it's any consolation, he was awfully pleased.

256
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:04,757
I bet he was! What are we going to do
about Ron Jones's peerage? Give him one too?

257
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:09,358
Prime Minister, we can't send
two Lord Ron Jones to the upper house.

258
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:11,757
It'll look like a job lot.

259
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:16,920
- I've got to give him something.
- Does he watch television?

260
00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:21,245
- He hasn't even got a set.
- Fine. Make him a governor of the BBC.

261
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:24,961
- Anything else?
- Yes, one small thing.

262
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,915
- I need a cook/housekeeper for the flat.
- You can advertise.

263
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:32,875
- No, a government cook/housekeeper.
- That could be difficult.

264
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:35,555
- Why?
- It's a private home.

265
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:39,555
I just want somebody to cook my lunch.
It's not unreasonable.

266
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,883
No, it's just not possible.

267
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:45,278
I can blow up the world,
but not ask for scrambled eggs?

268
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:49,719
- You can ASK for them.
- What if I asked the German ambassador?

269
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:52,919
That's 0K - official engagement,
government hospitality.

270
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:56,124
We'll provide a seven-course meal
with wine and brandy.

271
00:17:56,327 --> 00:18:00,115
The German ambassador's lunch
is government business, but mine isn't?

272
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,357
That is so. Any ambassador's.

273
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:07,561
Fine. Bernard, get the diary. On Monday,
I'll have lunch with the German ambassador.

274
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:12,721
On Tuesday, with the French ambassador;
on Wednesday, with the American ambassador,

275
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:16,277
on Thursday,
with the New Zealand High Commissioner.

276
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,086
- How many countries in the UN?
- 158.

277
00:18:19,247 --> 00:18:22,683
That'll take up six months,
then we'll start round again.

278
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:27,523
You can't have lunch with ambassadors
every day. There will be other official lunches.

279
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:30,195
Even better. We'll fill up the odd gaps.

280
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:34,724
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office
might have some views on that.

281
00:18:34,887 --> 00:18:38,084
They say that one Prime Minister's lunch
with an ambassador

282
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:40,715
destroys two years of patient diplomacy.

283
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,765
I'm not quite sure how they'd react to 158.

284
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:48,679
- It's absurd that no one caters for us here.
- It's been like that for 250 years.

285
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:51,799
- That's the clinching argument?
- For 250 years, yes.

286
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:55,204
It can't have been the clinching argument
for 250 years.

287
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:59,565
50 years ago, it had only been
the clinching argument for 200 years

288
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,997
and 100 years ago...

289
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:04,245
Sorry.

290
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:08,884
Humphrey, I want a cook/housekeeper
and I want you to see that she's paid for.

291
00:19:09,087 --> 00:19:11,476
Well, let me put it like this.

292
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:16,038
Do you want the press to announce
that your first act as Prime Minister

293
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:19,836
was to give yourself
a salary increase of £8,000 to £10,000?

294
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:22,123
We wouldn't tell them.

295
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:26,280
We have no alternative.
Prime Ministers' expenses must be published.

296
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:31,322
- There's no way that we can't not tell them?
- 0pen government. Freedom of information.

297
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:35,315
We should always tell the press
freely and frankly anything

298
00:19:35,487 --> 00:19:38,843
that they could easily find out some other way.

299
00:19:39,327 --> 00:19:43,479
- There must be some solution.
- There hasn't been for 250 years.

300
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:48,516
Now may we discuss government business?
You were saying that you'd been thinking.

301
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:53,918
Ah, yes. We're agreed that so far
my premiership has been a great success.

302
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,845
Oh, indeed.

303
00:19:56,007 --> 00:20:00,319
I've been asking myself what can I do
to continue this run of success.

304
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:03,963
Have you considered masterly inactivity?

305
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,920
No, Humphrey, a Prime Minister must be firm.

306
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:11,395
Indeed. How about firm masterly inactivity?

307
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:13,598
No, I shall be firm.

308
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:18,761
I've decided to cancel Trident,
channel £15 billion into conventional forces

309
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,566
and reintroduce conscription.

310
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:26,323
At one stroke, we shall solve
our defence, balance of payments,

311
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:30,002
unemployment and educational problems
all at once.

312
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,486
What do you say, Humphrey?

313
00:20:35,247 --> 00:20:39,525
You can't reorganise the entire defence
of the realm just like that.

314
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:42,560
I'm the Prime Minister. I have the power.

315
00:20:42,727 --> 00:20:47,721
Yes, within the law and the constitution
and the constraints of administrative precedent,

316
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:50,685
budgetary feasibility and cabinet government.

317
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:54,362
- You'll buy Cruise instead?
- No, no more nuclear weapons.

318
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:57,798
But, Prime Minister...
You're not a secret unilateralist?

319
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:02,000
- No, we still have Polaris.
- Polaris is a ramshackle old system.

320
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:08,276
The Soviets might develop a ballistic missile
defence system which could intercept Polaris.

321
00:21:08,487 --> 00:21:12,275
- By when?
- In strategic terms, any day now.

322
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:14,597
By what year precisely?

323
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:17,839
2020? But that's sooner than you think!

324
00:21:18,047 --> 00:21:23,041
Are you saying that this nuclear defence system
would stop all 192 Polaris missiles?

325
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:25,562
Not all, virtually all - 97%.

326
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:28,719
That would leave five bombs
that would get through?

327
00:21:28,927 --> 00:21:32,636
- A mere five!
- 0bliterating Moscow, Leningrad and Minsk.

328
00:21:32,847 --> 00:21:35,520
Yes, but that's about all.

329
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:38,247
Enough to make the Russians stop and think.

330
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:43,043
But it's not fair. With Trident we could
obliterate the whole of eastern Europe!

331
00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:45,198
- I don't want to!
- It's a deterrent.

332
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:49,155
- It's a bluff. I probably wouldn't use it.
- They don't know you probably wouldn't.

333
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:52,797
- They probably do.
- Yes, probably, but they can't certainly know.

334
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:54,645
They probably certainly know.

335
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:58,362
Yes, but though they probably certainly know
that you probably wouldn't,

336
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,041
they don't certainly know
that although you probably wouldn't,

337
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:03,721
there's no probability that you certainly would!

338
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:09,286
What?

339
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:12,607
It all boils down to one simple issue.

340
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:17,761
You are the Prime Minister of Great Britain.
Shouldn't Great Britain have the best?

341
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:19,844
Yes, of course.

342
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:24,398
If you walked into a nuclear missile showroom,
you would buy Trident!

343
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:27,286
It's lovely, it's elegant, it's beautiful.

344
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:31,440
It is quite simply the best,
and Britain should have the best.

345
00:22:31,607 --> 00:22:35,361
In the world of the nuclear missile,
it is the Savile Row suit,

346
00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:37,802
the Rolls-Royce Corniche,

347
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:40,481
the Château Lafite 1945.

348
00:22:40,647 --> 00:22:44,560
It is the nuclear missile Harrods would sell you.

349
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,841
What more can I say?

350
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:52,567
That it costs £15 billion and we don't need it.

351
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:55,241
You can say that about anything at Harrods.

352
00:22:59,887 --> 00:23:02,276
(MURMUR 0F COnVERSATIOn)

353
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:10,119
Ah, General!
I was hoping to have a word with you.

354
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:13,962
I wanted to sound you out about something.
You'll not like it.

355
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:18,484
- Tell me the worst.
- It will be very unpopular with the services.

356
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,161
- I'm planning to cancel Trident.
- Good idea.

357
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:25,115
Now, hold on, don't jump in too quickly.
No good trying to argue...

358
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:28,275
- What did you say?
- It's a good idea.

359
00:23:28,447 --> 00:23:32,679
- You're in favour? Why?
- We don't need it. Complete waste of money.

360
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:35,276
- That's what I said.
- You're right.

361
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:39,235
- The whole defence staff agree?
- The navy want to keep it.

362
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:43,195
Take away Trident
and they'd hardly have a role left.

363
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:45,921
- And the RAF?
- You could ask them.

364
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:50,558
If you're interested in the opinion
of garage mechanics. They'd want to keep it.

365
00:23:50,727 --> 00:23:53,241
They want to drop the bomb from an aeroplane.

366
00:23:53,407 --> 00:23:57,195
They just like dropping things on people,
but they're no good at it.

367
00:23:57,407 --> 00:23:59,921
Couldn't even close the runway at Port Stanley.

368
00:24:00,087 --> 00:24:03,363
Probably never find Moscow,
and if they did they'd miss it.

369
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,560
How do we get the policy through
if only the army is in favour?

370
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:11,402
As you know, the Chief of Defence Staff job
is becoming vacant.

371
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:14,684
Technically, it's the navy's turn,
but it's your decision.

372
00:24:14,847 --> 00:24:17,315
If you appoint a soldier, it's up to you.

373
00:24:17,527 --> 00:24:20,678
General, aren't you the most senior soldier?

374
00:24:20,887 --> 00:24:23,276
As it happens, I believe I am.

375
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:26,037
Thank you. Good advice.

376
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:28,323
Prime Minister, this is Mrs Glossop.

377
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:31,323
- Extraordinary thing!
- What?

378
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:34,479
I've come across a Prime Minister
with a bit of sense.

379
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:37,115
Really? Where? Which is the lucky country?

380
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:41,962
Ours. He's cancelling Trident.
I could hardly believe my ears.

381
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:45,642
I'm surprised you're happy
about reintroducing conscription.

382
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:50,477
- He didn't say anything about conscription.
- Slashes unemployment, wins votes.

383
00:24:50,687 --> 00:24:54,999
We're an elite army, best in the world.
Professional, tough, disciplined.

384
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:59,558
We can't bring in a mob of punks
and freaks and junkies and riff-raff.

385
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:02,841
A quarter of a million football hooligans?

386
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:07,122
- Peeling potatoes in Aldershot?
- I thought you'd say that.

387
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:11,200
- It'll be just an ordinary army.
- Like the one that won the last war?

388
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:14,359
All this equal opportunity nonsense, like America!

389
00:25:14,527 --> 00:25:19,442
They don't know if the troops posted to them
are men or women, not until they arrive.

390
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:22,041
- Sometimes not even then.
- Quite!

391
00:25:22,247 --> 00:25:25,717
- Much better to keep Trident.
- I thought you'd say that.

392
00:25:25,887 --> 00:25:29,675
- You must stop him.
- One can't just stop the Prime Minister.

393
00:25:29,847 --> 00:25:32,315
- What do we do?
- We must slow him down.

394
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:37,481
After a few months, most new Prime Ministers
have more or less ground to a halt anyway.

395
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:41,640
I'll have a word with the American ambassador
tomorrow morning.

396
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,275
- Good idea.
- I thought you'd say that.

397
00:25:44,447 --> 00:25:45,960
Oh, hello!

398
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:51,121
I want to make sure that the BBC and ITN get
good coverage on the White House lawn.

399
00:25:51,287 --> 00:25:56,805
Shot of me and the President. Then there'll be
more photo coverage inside the White House.

400
00:25:57,007 --> 00:25:58,520
Splendid.

401
00:25:58,687 --> 00:26:03,477
Then there'll be coverage of me and the President
at the start of talks the next day.

402
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:06,161
Then the President will say goodbye to me.

403
00:26:06,327 --> 00:26:11,117
I hope he takes my elbow with his left hand.
He did that with the West German Chancellor.

404
00:26:11,287 --> 00:26:14,484
Any chance of ensuring that beforehand
with the embassy?

405
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:18,521
That could be difficult.
Could you look at the Cabinet agenda?

406
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:21,195
I don't know what we have embassies for.

407
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:25,883
Any time you ask them to do something
really important, important for Britain...

408
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:30,518
- Weren't we to discuss scrapping Trident?
- Indeed we were, Prime Minister.

409
00:26:30,687 --> 00:26:35,317
But I thought in the first instance you might
think it wiser to go into it thoroughly,

410
00:26:35,487 --> 00:26:40,083
review all the implications,
as we are discussing the defence of the realm.

411
00:26:40,287 --> 00:26:45,077
- You're trying to stop me, Humphrey.
- No, but the Cabinet must have all the facts.

412
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:47,278
That's a novel idea.

413
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:52,677
There is a special reason why I thought
you might want to leave it for a while.

414
00:26:52,847 --> 00:26:57,637
I've learned from the American ambassador
informally that they would be very upset

415
00:26:57,807 --> 00:27:02,039
if we were to cancel Trident
and not order another of their missiles instead.

416
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,966
I might as well have it out with the President.

417
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:10,639
That's the point. The agenda of your meeting
with the President must be agreed in advance.

418
00:27:10,807 --> 00:27:13,401
You can't just go over there for a chat.

419
00:27:13,607 --> 00:27:15,802
- Why not?
- Well, you...

420
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:18,875
You might not think of anything to say.

421
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:25,245
If this proposal of yours were to be put to
the Americans, there would be a change of plan.

422
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:29,440
- What change of plan?
- Your meeting would not be with the President.

423
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:33,395
- You'd be entertained by the Vice-President.
- The Vice-President?!

424
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:37,242
- You can't be serious!
- I'm afraid so, Prime Minister.

425
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:41,406
Even Botswana was met by the President.
I saw it on the news.

426
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:44,798
Botswana hadn't just cancelled an order for Trident.

427
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:50,041
I'm sure they'll explain that the President
had catarrh or bruised his thumb or something.

428
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,237
Fallen asleep perhaps.

429
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:57,361
This meeting with the President is vital for PR.

430
00:27:57,567 --> 00:28:00,718
Then you should postpone the Trident discussion.

431
00:28:00,927 --> 00:28:06,081
A Prime Minister must show that there is
a new mind and a firm hand at Number 10.

432
00:28:06,247 --> 00:28:08,715
He must be seen to have made his mark.

433
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,401
- But you have, Prime Minister.
- How?

434
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:18,683
A cook...
seconded from the Cabinet Office canteen?

435
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:24,205
To cook lunch for me here at the flat?

436
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:28,280
Something that none of your predecessors
ever accomplished.

437
00:28:31,047 --> 00:28:33,800
A place in the history books.

438
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:38,482
I say! We've shown them who's in charge,
haven't we?

439
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:41,155
Indeed we have, Prime Minister.

440
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:44,205
A new mind and a firm hand and Trident.

441
00:28:44,407 --> 00:28:46,875
A place in the history books, you say.

442
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:51,837
Oh, leave Trident off the Cabinet agenda
for the time being. That is my firm decision.

443
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,686
- All right?
- Yes, Prime Minister.
