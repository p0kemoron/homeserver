1
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:04,365
There's a big 'For Sale' sign...

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:06,685
Yes - we're open for inspection in 15.

3
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:09,405
You're never to set foot
in this house again!

4
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:11,525
Let me give the bride away.

5
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,045
I'm a legal pariah,

6
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:15,885
and your stupid fucking film's
only gonna make matters worse.

7
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:18,965
Tikki Wendon's superbly imaginative plan
to build an edifice...

8
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,125
By ‘edifice', you mean ‘casino', right?

9
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:23,685
- How much did I win?
- 160 grand.

10
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:25,605
Marcel's, I'm in. 150 you said, right?

11
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,525
I can have a bank cheque
for you tomorrow.

12
00:00:27,645 --> 00:00:31,045
Oh, no, I did not mean 'Reply all"
I did not mean 'Reply all'

13
00:01:26,405 --> 00:01:27,925
Teatime.

14
00:02:08,885 --> 00:02:11,045
Hit the floor,
or I'll blow your head off!

15
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,965
Got time for a cuppa, boys?

16
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:16,325
Well, I wouldn't say no. Thanks, Rod.

17
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:18,485
Colder than a nun's out there.

18
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:22,685
I got some of Denise's fruitcake here.
I told her you'd be popping in.

19
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:25,285
How's young Ryan going, mate?
Getting excited?

20
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:28,805
Mm. I've been showing him road maps
of where we'll be staying along the way.

21
00:02:28,925 --> 00:02:30,485
Very excited, I think.

22
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:40,285
See that dog's breakfast of a game
on Saturday?

23
00:02:40,405 --> 00:02:43,285
Burgess had his hand under it.
No way did that ball touch the grass.

24
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:45,485
You could see all that from the stand,
could you?

25
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:47,525
Well, yes,
you could've seen it from Mars.

26
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:56,925
You comfy?

27
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:59,885
I'll give you blokes ten minutes,
then I'll hit the panic button.

28
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:03,445
Make it 15. I gotta water the horse.
Like emptying a full bath, these days.

29
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:10,165
Regards to Denise and Ryan, mate.

30
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:32,565
They're on the wrong bloody level.

31
00:03:57,885 --> 00:03:59,685
Hello?

32
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:01,285
Can I help you?

33
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:17,565
Whoo! Fuck yeah!

34
00:04:20,965 --> 00:04:23,685
What kind of fucking place doesn't
do vodka shots with quinoa?

35
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,205
- Fuck!
- Calm down, Paulie!

36
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:28,325
No fucking activated almonds?
Am I fucking...? Am I asking too much?

37
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:29,765
- Calm down.
- Am I?

38
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:31,325
Activated almonds?

39
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:33,085
Where am I, Lobotomy Central?

40
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:34,965
I thought you wanted sex.

41
00:04:35,085 --> 00:04:37,005
Oh, I do.

42
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,165
11 long months
of gruelling handwork.

43
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:42,045
It's open slather here.

44
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:43,565
Yeah.

45
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:46,045
I'm a fool for a chinwag, though.

46
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:50,245
Preferably something that doesn't
involve the letters O-M-G or L-O-L.

47
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:51,725
- Whoo!
- Is it?

48
00:04:51,845 --> 00:04:53,685
I love this shit!

49
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:56,005
Ever read any Balzac?

50
00:04:57,525 --> 00:04:59,045
Who?

51
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,685
Oh... Don't worry - neither have I.

52
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:04,085
But I'm thinking
maybe tonight's the night.

53
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:05,845
Bang, bang, bang!

54
00:05:07,005 --> 00:05:09,525
Why do you hang around
with this fucktard?

55
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:12,445
I'm a merchant banker. He's Paul Wendon.

56
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:15,365
Stepson of the second richest woman
in the country.

57
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:19,685
In 2009, there was 15 degrees
of separation between me and Tikki.

58
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:22,565
That there is one degree.

59
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:30,085
Didn't happen to bring your mum,
did you?

60
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,325
Who's there? Who's...?!

61
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,285
Welcome, welcome!

62
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,365
Kids! Come and say hello
to Nicole and baby lain. Come on.

63
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:17,965
Hi, Nicole. Hi, lain.

64
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:19,405
Hi. Hi.

65
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:22,365
Nicole's gonna be staying with us
until she finds herself a place

66
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:24,605
and until Daddy gets back
to his old self, OK?

67
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:26,325
Where's lain's dad?

68
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:30,005
Hello, Maria.

69
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,125
- Oh.
- Hello, Barney.

70
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:34,485
- Uh, Mum, this is Scarlet.
- Hello.

71
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:37,885
Oh, Scarlet! Hello!

72
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:39,565
Oh.

73
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:51,805
She said it's very nice to meet you.

74
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:53,885
It's lovely to meet you, too.

75
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:55,605
OK, let's get you settled.

76
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:59,085
Um, and then we've got to take Barney
to the hospital.

77
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:02,165
- Come on, kids.
- It's alright.

78
00:07:02,285 --> 00:07:03,845
Let's show them their room.

79
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:07,045
- I'll grab those...
- No, no, no, no.

80
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:37,205
- Yeah?
- Hey, you. It's me.

81
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:39,885
Shoshanna tells me I have
an hour break in my diary.

82
00:07:40,005 --> 00:07:42,645
I thought you might like
to come join me for breakfast.

83
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:45,285
Uh, what is the Shoshanna?
Is that a bedspread?

84
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:47,165
- Are you interested or not?
- Not.

85
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:50,645
I'm, uh, having a power breakfast
with some clients.

86
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:53,045
OK, well, do you have your diary handy?

87
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:54,525
Yeah.

88
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:57,045
Uh, well, I've got
an appalling run of stuff this week.

89
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:58,645
Um, Friday?

90
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,725
No. Unless Shoshanna
can triage my diary.

91
00:08:01,845 --> 00:08:03,525
Do what to your diary?

92
00:08:03,645 --> 00:08:05,445
It's an expression.

93
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:09,485
No, no, no, no. ‘Triage my diary'
is an abuse of the language.

94
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:11,445
Friday's no good for me anyway.

95
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:14,605
My own diary passed away
with renal failure last week

96
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,485
surrounded by loved ones.

97
00:08:16,605 --> 00:08:19,365
You are still pissed off with me
about the damn film, aren't you?

98
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:21,325
What? What are you talking about?

99
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:24,685
I wasn't awake for long enough
to have an opinion.

100
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,685
Look, I don't want
to say goodbye like this.

101
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:29,125
I have to go back to the States soon
to finish my novel.

102
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:31,165
A novel! Do tell!

103
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:34,245
It's just hit me - you're jealous.

104
00:08:34,365 --> 00:08:38,125
No, worse - envious.
The poison side of jealousy.

105
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:41,365
I've gone out and I've made a career
and a name for myself

106
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:45,085
and you are a still-life study
of self-indulgent failure.

107
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:50,365
Oh, and you are the Kim Kardashian
of the literary world.

108
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:51,805
OK, no, no.

109
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:58,205
You are a morbidly obese woman who
sheds 100 kilos and then writes a book.

110
00:08:58,325 --> 00:08:59,925
A novelist! Come on!

111
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:01,725
Why don't you go get fucked?

112
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:03,965
- Oh, so Friday's off, then?
- Goodbye, Cleaver.

113
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,005
Good luck with the whole Tolstoy thing.

114
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,325
So you didn't see nothing suspicious?

115
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:14,885
Everything was 100% normal.

116
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:16,485
Right, Vern?

117
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:19,525
Yeah.
Yeah, it was a very ordinary night.

118
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:22,205
We had a cuppa, some cake.

119
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,125
Who would do this to Rod?

120
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:27,205
Oh, if I could get my hands
on that scum...

121
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:31,685
Vernon Arnold Walters
and Phillip Ryan Granter,

122
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:35,325
we are arresting you on suspicion
of the murder of Rodney Howley.

123
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:37,885
Eh?

124
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:40,565
Last round, darling,
and then it's over.

125
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:43,045
The kids wanted to come up
but I thought it was best...

126
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,925
No, no, no. A little later.

127
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:46,565
- Yeah.
- When it's all over.

128
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:48,765
Yeah.
Hey, how'd it go with Ryan?

129
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:51,685
Uh, he's still waiting
on two of the Braybrook statements.

130
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:54,925
Oh, we should get going, then.

131
00:09:56,325 --> 00:09:57,845
Hey...

132
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:01,605
Hey...

133
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:05,605
So...

134
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:08,645
You should go.

135
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:11,485
You know she hates to be kept waiting.

136
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:19,365
So she's...

137
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,805
The first one, Scarlet,
she's still your wife?

138
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:24,325
Mm-hmm.

139
00:10:24,445 --> 00:10:25,965
And Nicole is...

140
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:29,405
..you have a child with her, do you?

141
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:30,885
Mm-hmm.

142
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,725
And they both work together?
And you all live in the same house?

143
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,525
Mm-hmm, we do.

144
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:39,245
Chemo's beginning
to look relatively easy, then.

145
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:41,645
Mm-hmm.

146
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:44,725
This State
doesn't need another casino.

147
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:48,245
I'm sorry, but this is
an emotional issue for me, alright?

148
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:52,765
My old man, straight as a die, a banker,
shot through because of gambling.

149
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:56,725
Came home from school one day...
and he wasn't there.

150
00:10:56,845 --> 00:11:01,165
Mm. It's a moving story but I wouldn't
say any of that at the party meeting.

151
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,205
No, that is way too loser-y.

152
00:11:04,325 --> 00:11:05,685
If you don't mind me saying.

153
00:11:05,805 --> 00:11:07,325
We have a choice here. Alright?

154
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:10,285
A facility surrounded
by a small nature reserve

155
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:13,725
with a place for disabled kids,
for old people.

156
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:15,365
Maybe even a small zoo.

157
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:17,965
Or we can just give over the land
to another bloody casino

158
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:19,445
for Tikki Wendon.

159
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:21,085
We have a zoo. How often do you go?

160
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:23,485
- You've seen one giraffe...
- You've seen 'em all.

161
00:11:23,605 --> 00:11:25,005
Let's put out a poll.

162
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,005
No, no, no, no. No, no.
No poll, alright?

163
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,085
That is my decision - no to a casino.

164
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:30,805
And you think caucus will support you?

165
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:32,805
Yes, I think both of them will.

166
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:37,485
I think we can knock out
a poll by Friday.

167
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:39,005
- Earlier.
- Yeah.

168
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,725
What's with that shit about his dad?

169
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:43,085
As you know, usually at this time,

170
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:47,205
we're privileged to have the company
of the wonderful Tikki Wendon

171
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:49,925
to discuss the world
of business and finance with us.

172
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:53,885
But last night,
this great Australian entrepreneur,

173
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:58,085
employer of thousands,
suffered a personal tragedy.

174
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,925
Her offices were broken into, robbed
and vandalised.

175
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:05,725
I even read
an unconfirmed report on the net

176
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:09,005
that said Tikki herself
was threatened at knifepoint.

177
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,125
Now, she's apologised
for not being with us today,

178
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:16,205
but, friends, if I know Tikki,
she's undeterred.

179
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:20,405
She's ready to right
this fundamentally un-Australian wrong.

180
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:23,445
Now, this is an attack
on Australian business.

181
00:12:23,565 --> 00:12:25,645
This is an attack on our way of life.

182
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:28,925
For every dollar
that TWE invests in this country,

183
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:30,965
we citizens earn four.

184
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:34,565
Now, I'm no champion of big business,
as you know,

185
00:12:34,685 --> 00:12:39,165
but for God's sake, people,
Tikki Wendon is one of the good guys.

186
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:41,325
Where the hell is he?

187
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:47,245
Morning, Tik. Rene.

188
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:48,805
Paul.

189
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:50,965
So, what's the damage?

190
00:12:51,085 --> 00:12:53,805
Took about 15 laptops
and smashed the mainframe.

191
00:12:53,925 --> 00:12:55,725
Jesus. God only knows
what they've taken.

192
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:58,845
Everything's backed up. There's
no real problem. They caught them.

193
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:02,325
Yeah, but what's on those computers?
You know, and they got at the mainframe.

194
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:03,965
It's all encrypted.

195
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:07,045
Nothing happens on this floor
of any consequence.

196
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:09,485
Which is why you are working here.

197
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:13,365
Still, you know, something
might have, um, leaked out or...

198
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:14,925
Like what?

199
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,605
I don't know.

200
00:13:16,725 --> 00:13:21,445
Of all the departments of all the groups
of all the companies in this city,

201
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:23,365
they had to break into yours.

202
00:13:23,485 --> 00:13:25,285
Tik, come on, that's...

203
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:28,125
Paul, the only reason
I tolerate your presence here

204
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:31,325
is because your father
is still a great root

205
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:34,045
and, for reasons
beyond my comprehension,

206
00:13:34,165 --> 00:13:36,405
he seems to be fond of you.

207
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,845
- Well, I guess...
- Hal

208
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:42,565
Rene, darling, get this lot out of here.

209
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:44,925
I don't need them
prodding around my business.

210
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:49,485
And then I want you to find out who
they arrested and why they broke in.

211
00:13:50,485 --> 00:13:52,525
I want to know
what happened here last night.

212
00:13:57,285 --> 00:13:59,765
Nicole! Nicole!

213
00:13:59,885 --> 00:14:01,605
Busy!

214
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,525
I can't make head or tail
of this Michael Thornton file.

215
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,205
This is the second attachment
for the Braybrook files.

216
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,125
Did he insert the device into his anus

217
00:14:10,245 --> 00:14:13,365
before he went to the store
or after he arrived at the store?

218
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,965
[t's Thornton Michael,
it's not Michael Thornton.

219
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:18,205
And that second one
is for the Land Commission...

220
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:21,245
Oh. Oh.
His parents called him 'Thornton'?

221
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:23,405
No wonder the man's
got psychological damage.

222
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:25,525
See, that could be our defence
right there.

223
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:27,845
Sorry, do you mind?
I have a huge session today.

224
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:30,645
It's panic stations, so you can
have Nicole when I'm through,

225
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:32,165
if I get through.

226
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:35,045
Because if he popped it up his pooper
before he went to the store,

227
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,205
it'll obviously
play differently in court...

228
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:38,885
This is not working for me!

229
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:41,325
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for a hundred things.

230
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:42,965
I'm sorry you never made silk.

231
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:45,765
I am sorry that
all your ex-clients prefer me.

232
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,205
I am sorry that you can't get a gig
on the Commissions, but I did try.

233
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:53,965
Oh, yes, yes, I'm sure minutes
of exhaustive toil went into that.

234
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:56,565
OK, I didn't try.

235
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:59,165
I don't want you anywhere near
my Hearings Commissions.

236
00:14:59,285 --> 00:15:00,765
I'm sorry. I know what you're like.

237
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:02,205
Oh.

238
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:05,245
You grandstand, you'll undermine me
and you'll just get in my road.

239
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:08,125
- Scarlet Engels's chambers.
- And Cleaver Greene's chambers.

240
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:10,165
- No! No more!
- Yep, yep, she's on her way.

241
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:13,325
Now, you can keep your chambers
down there for another couple of weeks

242
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,765
and then you're on your own.

243
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:16,805
You might want to tell me
when I haven't been.

244
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:19,285
And the same applies to Nicole.
She works for me now.

245
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:23,525
So, will you please leave?!

246
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:33,885
Fuck off!

247
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:01,125
Still inserted.

248
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:05,005
It's what he attacked the shop assistant
with. It was pretty ugly, really.

249
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,485
- Lovely.
- Mm.

250
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:07,725
Thank you.

251
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:10,045
And you shouldn't
have antagonised her like that.

252
00:16:10,165 --> 00:16:11,765
You have to handle her with kid gloves.

253
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:14,965
Ooh. Cracks already appearing
in the love walls.

254
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:17,485
This is a short-term measure
to take the strain off him.

255
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:21,765
Yeah. All three of you
in that one little nest.

256
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:24,445
Poor sick old Barney in the middle.

257
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:27,245
That's a special circle of hell.

258
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:31,685
Felicity.

259
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:34,405
I couldn't find your number anywhere.

260
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:37,165
Uh, yes, sorry about all the... this.

261
00:16:37,285 --> 00:16:39,765
I was... I'm getting
the whole thing redone.

262
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:41,645
It was very old-fashioned.

263
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:44,085
I'm taking on some more people.

264
00:16:45,485 --> 00:16:48,405
Hello. I'm Nicole,
I'm one of his 'more people'.

265
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:50,485
- Ah.
- Would you like a coffee?

266
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:52,165
Uh, no. Thank you.

267
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:54,605
- I need your help.
- OK.

268
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:56,245
- Nicole.
- Mm.

269
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:59,525
Uh, could you... triage my 12 o'clock?

270
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,805
Yes. Almost too easy.

271
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:06,565
Some people I know,
old friends of Malcolm's,

272
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:08,245
they really were very good to him,

273
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:11,565
they've landed themselves
in some pretty serious legal trouble.

274
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:13,245
I said you might help.

275
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:17,485
So you broke into the building
to steal what? A desk?

276
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:21,405
But then you didn't, and then you left,

277
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,205
and now you're charged with murder.

278
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:25,125
Well, that's pretty much
how it happened.

279
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:29,965
Right, but-but you say that you did
threaten and tie up the guard.

280
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:32,285
Tied him up, yeah, never denied that.

281
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:35,965
And then he was shot,
but you say you didn't do it.

282
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:38,005
- No.
- Don't own a gun.

283
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,005
You were holding a gun on the monitor.

284
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,805
That was a toy.

285
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:46,925
OK. So, uh... did you know this guard?

286
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:50,165
Uh, I never met him. Phil?

287
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:53,165
- You work with him.
- Might have seen him about.

288
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:55,405
Do you know how many people
work in TWE Towers?

289
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:57,165
- There's more than 2,000.
- OK.

290
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,365
So you're in the building,
wearing tea-cosies on your head,

291
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:02,085
holding a toy gun,

292
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:06,045
like the Penguin
about to break into the masked ball,

293
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:08,365
but then you didn't steal anything.

294
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:09,925
Why not?

295
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:11,565
Conscience.

296
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:15,365
When we got in there, we realised
that there's no future in crime.

297
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:17,125
None. None at all.

298
00:18:17,245 --> 00:18:20,485
There's not much of a future
in that story, either, fellas.

299
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:24,285
Come on, you're gonna
have to throw me a bone here.

300
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:26,805
We didn't shoot him.

301
00:18:43,565 --> 00:18:46,085
I'm not gonna get through this, am I?

302
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:47,725
Yes, you will.

303
00:18:48,845 --> 00:18:50,525
You're paid to say that, aren't you?

304
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:53,165
Yeah. Not nearly enough.

305
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:05,045
Did you know the chance of life,
any life, on this planet

306
00:19:05,165 --> 00:19:12,845
is 0.00000001

307
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:15,405
that anything exists?

308
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:21,965
Elephants, plants, dogs,
amoeba, tapeworms.

309
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:23,805
Yeah. Incredible.

310
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:29,485
Cats, budgerigars, those little beetles
that only appear at Christmas.

311
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:34,925
The fact that we exist
is so totally random

312
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:41,005
the idea that any human life
is important is absurd.

313
00:19:45,765 --> 00:19:48,445
Don't tell my mother that.
She's a Catholic.

314
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:58,725
Cancer often provokes
these sorts of questions.

315
00:19:58,845 --> 00:20:00,405
Life and meaning.

316
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:05,845
No, it provokes questions
of utter meaninglessness.

317
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:11,765
Why have I brought another random child
into this world?

318
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:17,965
And now I'm gonna leave him
and my other kids

319
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:20,445
without ever knowing how they turn out.

320
00:20:25,565 --> 00:20:27,405
Try not to worry.

321
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:29,445
You aren't gonna solve it.

322
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:32,605
Just get yourself better.

323
00:20:32,725 --> 00:20:35,405
Sit on the beach
with your beautiful kids,

324
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,365
have a good glass of red.

325
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:41,325
You'll kind of remember
what it's all about.

326
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:45,965
I suppose I have to go home.

327
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:49,245
Would you prefer to stay the night,
if I organised it?

328
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:56,325
Yeah.

329
00:20:57,325 --> 00:21:00,325
I feel as if I'm
standing on the edge of an abyss.

330
00:21:00,445 --> 00:21:03,285
My wife has left me
for her Zumba instructor.

331
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:06,565
I... I feel that only Wendy can help me.

332
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:10,125
Thank you so much. 4:30?

333
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:11,805
Marvellous.

334
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:15,485
Mason. James Mason.

335
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:19,125
Thank you. I shall triage my diary.

336
00:21:22,005 --> 00:21:23,965
What the fuck is this?

337
00:21:29,645 --> 00:21:33,045
I am so proud of you for finally
coming to terms with your sexuality.

338
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:37,045
I mean, that is... that is a huge step,
you know?

339
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:40,325
And I think it's absolutely right that
you acknowledge that to yourself

340
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:41,925
and, uh, maybe to family,

341
00:21:42,045 --> 00:21:44,565
but... I just...

342
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:49,725
..I wonder about the wisdom
of coming out on The Footy Show.

343
00:21:49,845 --> 00:21:52,845
Well, I'll be there anyway
for the handball competition.

344
00:21:52,965 --> 00:21:54,805
Mm... I...

345
00:21:56,605 --> 00:22:01,005
I don't... I don't know if those
two ideas are really connected.

346
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,765
You know? I just...

347
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:05,165
Tell you what,
can we hold off on that decision

348
00:22:05,285 --> 00:22:07,365
until after our session next week,
do you think?

349
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:08,965
- Yeah, sure, yeah.
- Yeah?

350
00:22:09,085 --> 00:22:10,605
- Let's do that.
- OK.

351
00:22:10,725 --> 00:22:12,485
Well done.

352
00:22:16,725 --> 00:22:18,765
- OK, I'll see you next week.
- Thanks a lot.

353
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,045
Oh. Great. I knew it.

354
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:25,245
Minute Libby told me that James Mason
wanted to see me, I knew it was you.

355
00:22:25,365 --> 00:22:27,805
Please go away. Nanette. John.

356
00:22:27,925 --> 00:22:30,165
L-let me explain about the other night.
OK?

357
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:34,005
First of all, Roger attacked me.
I never hit him.

358
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,525
No, but you tried to.

359
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,205
And if Roger wasn't
such a magnificent physical specimen,

360
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:39,845
you might have actually connected.

361
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:42,485
As it was, he subdued you
in front of your son and my guests.

362
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:44,165
I admit I was emotional.

363
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:46,085
You lunged at me in front of my fiance.

364
00:22:46,205 --> 00:22:48,325
And you sold the family home
without telling me.

365
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:50,645
You did. And that home was a half mine.

366
00:22:50,765 --> 00:22:52,285
- No! No!
- Yes.

367
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:56,525
No, no, no. 20 years ago,
you stumped up the 10% deposit

368
00:22:56,645 --> 00:22:59,525
because of an unexpectedly slow track
on Derby Day -

369
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:02,365
all of the other payments
were made by me.

370
00:23:02,485 --> 00:23:04,085
You know, the time you spent in prison

371
00:23:04,205 --> 00:23:07,525
was the most peaceful time
I have ever known.

372
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:09,565
The moment you get out, chaos reigns.

373
00:23:09,685 --> 00:23:11,165
Come on. Come on.

374
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:13,725
Come on, darlin".
It's not... I'm not the bad guy.

375
00:23:13,845 --> 00:23:17,925
No. Cleave, we don't use the term 'bad',
people in my profession, alright?

376
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:22,845
You are a developmentally arrested,
infantile, dysfunctional narcissist.

377
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:25,045
And I don't want to see you. OK?

378
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:27,645
The era of the casual drop-in is over.

379
00:23:28,805 --> 00:23:31,365
Oh, fucking... great!

380
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:35,885
So, Vernon and Phil
have been with you here for 16 years

381
00:23:36,005 --> 00:23:38,125
and nobody can tell me
anything about 'em?

382
00:23:38,245 --> 00:23:41,005
Well, they kept to themselves.

383
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,525
Yeah.

384
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:47,525
So, nobody ever said
"Hello, do you have kids, Vernon?'

385
00:23:47,645 --> 00:23:52,685
Ah! I think they both like
tenpin bowling.

386
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:54,885
Ah.

387
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:56,445
Right.

388
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:58,565
OK, what about the security guard?

389
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:04,485
He's been here sitting at the same desk
every night for 20 years.

390
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:10,165
Nobody ever accidentally tripped over
and said hi?

391
00:24:10,285 --> 00:24:11,885
No. No.

392
00:24:12,005 --> 00:24:13,925
Maybe once.

393
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:17,285
Oh... twice.

394
00:24:18,365 --> 00:24:20,085
But I tell you this -

395
00:24:20,205 --> 00:24:22,365
they did not kill him, no way.

396
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:24,365
Right. OK.

397
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:27,925
And you know that because of
their purported love of tenpin bowling?

398
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:29,685
Yeah.

399
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:37,245
Do you ever go to the football,

400
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:40,285
look at the crowd, and think,

401
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:43,405
'Everyone here at some point
is gonna die'?

402
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:46,885
You gotta stop
barracking for Parramatta, mate.

403
00:24:47,005 --> 00:24:51,085
That could well be
the cause of your cancer right there.

404
00:24:52,165 --> 00:24:54,005
There is no bloody order,

405
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,165
no such thing as fate,

406
00:24:57,285 --> 00:24:59,885
just the certainty it'll get you.

407
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:05,325
Mm. Jesus. Think I preferred
your mindless optimism to this shit.

408
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:09,045
We're alone, mate.

409
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,565
That's what I realise now.

410
00:25:11,685 --> 00:25:13,165
No, we're not.

411
00:25:13,285 --> 00:25:15,725
No, we're not.
We look after each other, don't we?

412
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:17,525
You know...

413
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:21,485
..to my mind,

414
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:25,165
our friendship really comes to life
in the courtroom, doesn't it?

415
00:25:26,165 --> 00:25:27,685
Hey?

416
00:25:27,805 --> 00:25:31,405
I mean, how many people's destinies
have we saved over time?

417
00:25:32,605 --> 00:25:36,885
83 rapists, 61 drug dealers,

418
00:25:37,005 --> 00:25:39,085
12 murderers,

419
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,765
a dog fucker...

420
00:25:40,885 --> 00:25:42,845
And how good did it make us feel?

421
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:51,845
You know, I got a really juicy
little murder just now.

422
00:25:53,565 --> 00:25:56,805
Two sweet old guys, no alibi...

423
00:25:56,925 --> 00:26:00,045
Cleave... I can't.

424
00:26:00,165 --> 00:26:01,645
What?

425
00:26:02,845 --> 00:26:04,565
I wasn't asking you for anything.

426
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:08,965
See you, Barnabas.

427
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,405
‘Candice hugged the plane blanket..."

428
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:15,725
Cradled. No - hugged.

429
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:19,525
Jet plane. All planes are jets.

430
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:22,245
"like it was the lover
she had just...

431
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:24,285
No. Just.

432
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:27,085
Only.

433
00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:30,685
'..only just... only just left at JFK."

434
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:33,365
Heathrow? Paris. Rome.

435
00:26:33,485 --> 00:26:35,485
Roma. Make it a train.

436
00:26:35,605 --> 00:26:37,205
Gardermoen. Prague.

437
00:26:37,325 --> 00:26:38,925
Everybody bloody leaves from Prague.

438
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:41,645
Budapest.
Don't know anything about Budapest.

439
00:26:41,765 --> 00:26:44,725
I do. Two cities - Buda and Pest.

440
00:26:48,925 --> 00:26:50,165
What?

441
00:26:50,285 --> 00:26:54,365
I may have been a tad off-message
when we spoke last time.

442
00:26:54,485 --> 00:26:58,325
Really? You think? Off-message?
A morbidly obese Kim Kardashian?

443
00:26:58,445 --> 00:27:01,965
Only in the literary sense.
Come on, can I make it up to you?

444
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:03,565
No. That would be impossible.

445
00:27:03,685 --> 00:27:05,445
Oh, come on, let me try.

446
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:08,205
Triage your diary one last time.

447
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:12,285
Lunch. On me. Yeah?

448
00:27:12,405 --> 00:27:16,365
Come on, I will make it up to you.
Promise.

449
00:27:18,365 --> 00:27:20,205
Where is everybody?

450
00:27:20,325 --> 00:27:22,525
Tuesdays are notoriously quiet.

451
00:27:22,645 --> 00:27:24,765
Well, if Tuesdays are quiet,
Fridays are...

452
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:26,845
Do you ever have a busy day in here?

453
00:27:26,965 --> 00:27:28,605
Please.

454
00:27:29,965 --> 00:27:31,685
Ah.

455
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:35,285
So... how is every little thing?

456
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,205
Fine. Thanks for asking.

457
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:38,805
Welcome.

458
00:27:41,005 --> 00:27:42,525
Ooh.

459
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:44,805
These walnuts were grown
in the Hunter Valley.

460
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:49,405
Marcel has taken the meat of the walnut
and fused it with Tasmanian truffle oil,

461
00:27:49,525 --> 00:27:52,205
shaved fennel grown in his own garden,

462
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:55,085
and an infusion of herbs
and aged Bénédictine,

463
00:27:55,205 --> 00:27:56,765
served on a lime and beetroot smear.

464
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:58,285
Enjoy.

465
00:27:58,405 --> 00:27:59,725
Ah.

466
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,285
Incredible, huh?

467
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:05,045
What happened to the whole 'l don't care
if the walnut is a lesbian crack whore

468
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:07,125
served on a Pap smear' rant?

469
00:28:07,245 --> 00:28:09,045
Come on, you've gotta keep up
a little bit.

470
00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:11,245
OK? This is... This is diff...

471
00:28:11,365 --> 00:28:13,845
This is food as art. Alright?

472
00:28:13,965 --> 00:28:15,965
It's like an installation.

473
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:18,645
Tracey Emin
would understand this walnut.

474
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:22,525
And you accuse me of being a wanker?

475
00:28:22,645 --> 00:28:26,125
Come on, look,
I didn't come here to argue. Alright?

476
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:28,885
You told me I was a fraud.

477
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:32,005
Another starter, compliments of Marcel.

478
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:35,925
Organic tomato,
fused with lime pith and quince,

479
00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:39,165
roasted over a 490-degree flame
for six seconds...

480
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:40,925
Again, with complimentary...

481
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:44,325
You, who have never put yourself
on the line for anyone...

482
00:28:44,445 --> 00:28:46,445
Served with spelt millet loaf

483
00:28:46,565 --> 00:28:48,925
and garden arugula
with pronounced astringent nuts.

484
00:28:49,045 --> 00:28:51,885
Is anybody paying
for shit in this place, mate?

485
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:57,645
Sometimes I wonder if you know
what that word 'friend' even means.

486
00:28:57,765 --> 00:29:00,805
I know what it means. Alright?

487
00:29:00,925 --> 00:29:02,885
Why did you even invite me here?

488
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:12,045
What? Come on.

489
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:14,365
Hmm?

490
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:17,965
- You have got to be fucking joking.
- What?

491
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:22,965
You're going away. Who knows
when we'll see each other again?

492
00:29:23,085 --> 00:29:25,445
I need closure.

493
00:29:25,565 --> 00:29:28,085
Don't you need closure?

494
00:29:28,205 --> 00:29:29,765
Hmph.

495
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:33,645
Hmm?

496
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:35,685
Hmm...

497
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:44,485
Mm?

498
00:29:44,605 --> 00:29:47,925
Excuse the symbolism,
but for old time's sake...

499
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,645
Mm.

500
00:29:53,765 --> 00:29:56,285
Organic tomato,

501
00:29:56,405 --> 00:30:00,645
infused with
self-indulgent, abject failure.

502
00:30:01,645 --> 00:30:03,845
Consider yourself closed.

503
00:30:07,645 --> 00:30:09,845
Here you go, take it easy.

504
00:30:09,965 --> 00:30:11,685
Nicole? We're back.

505
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:16,165
Hey. Hi.

506
00:30:16,285 --> 00:30:18,845
Oh, no, no, not in that chair.
He needs support for his back.

507
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:20,485
Right.

508
00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:22,085
Hey?

509
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:23,645
Here you go.

510
00:30:23,765 --> 00:30:25,525
Here you go. Easy, easy.

511
00:30:25,645 --> 00:30:27,725
Here, I made some vegetable broth.

512
00:30:27,845 --> 00:30:29,765
Oh, good. It looks a bit gluggy.

513
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:32,285
Well, it was fine half an hour ago,
SO...

514
00:30:32,405 --> 00:30:35,085
Oh. We'll sort it out
when we get home from work, hmm?

515
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:36,645
Alright.

516
00:30:36,765 --> 00:30:38,565
You just relax.

517
00:30:45,605 --> 00:30:47,605
- Bye.
- Bye.

518
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:57,245
Hey, Cleave.
I'm right to come back to work.

519
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:04,325
The prosecution's case
consists of actual footage

520
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:07,685
of Abbott and Costello
breaking into the building.

521
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:12,405
Um... Phil then takes his mask off
to catch his breath,

522
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:15,805
and then remembers
and pulls it back on again.

523
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:18,445
Vernon takes a toilet break
holding a gun.

524
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:20,005
Are you OK?

525
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:23,205
Dying. But I suppose we all are.

526
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:27,325
Then there's a nice shot
of a licence plate on the ute

527
00:31:27,445 --> 00:31:28,925
as it enters the building.

528
00:31:29,045 --> 00:31:31,925
A ute which is registered to Phil.

529
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:35,845
Basically the entire defence case
at the moment

530
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:38,685
consists of me saying,
'l don't believe they did it.

531
00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:42,325
They didn't. Should you even be up?

532
00:31:42,445 --> 00:31:44,645
It's safer for him here
than it is at home.

533
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:46,125
It is.

534
00:31:46,245 --> 00:31:52,925
Now, look, you contacted me because you
said these blokes were friends of Mal's.

535
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:55,605
Is there any other connection
I need to know about?

536
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:58,285
In my world,
friends of family are friends.

537
00:31:58,405 --> 00:32:00,405
I realise your world
doesn't work that way,

538
00:32:00,525 --> 00:32:03,285
not if you're willing to drag
a dying mate in here to help you out.

539
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:06,845
You were born and grew up in
the same area as these guys, though.

540
00:32:06,965 --> 00:32:09,245
A lot of people are born in my area.

541
00:32:09,365 --> 00:32:11,165
It's a working-class suburb.

542
00:32:11,285 --> 00:32:13,925
We breed more
than people from leafier suburbs.

543
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:17,245
Oh, what is this, Paris 1968?

544
00:32:17,365 --> 00:32:18,925
It's not a fucking class war.

545
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:22,085
My old man ran a hardware store.
His old boy...

546
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:24,765
What did your old...?
He didn't do anything too flash.

547
00:32:24,885 --> 00:32:29,085
Now, look, you asked me to help you out
with these knuckleheads,

548
00:32:29,205 --> 00:32:32,285
and that is precisely
what I'm trying to do, OK?

549
00:32:32,405 --> 00:32:34,965
But I need a little more information.

550
00:32:36,005 --> 00:32:38,405
OK. I will ask around.

551
00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:40,485
Go to bed.

552
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:43,285
Thanks.

553
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:51,085
Your dad really ran a hardware store,
did he?

554
00:32:51,205 --> 00:32:55,925
Nothing I can't tell you about
sheet metal, screws and surface plugs.

555
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:57,525
Hmm.

556
00:33:04,285 --> 00:33:05,885
What?

557
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:07,525
What's wrong with you?

558
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:09,605
Why would two guys in Maintenance

559
00:33:09,725 --> 00:33:12,445
need to break in
if they already worked there?

560
00:33:13,565 --> 00:33:15,125
I've no idea.

561
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:18,205
Maybe there were parts of the building
they couldn't access.

562
00:33:18,325 --> 00:33:20,365
Shit, I don't know,
none of it makes any sense.

563
00:33:20,485 --> 00:33:22,565
You know half of the security tapes
are missing?

564
00:33:22,685 --> 00:33:26,125
Of all the floors in that building,
only that floor was hit.

565
00:33:26,245 --> 00:33:30,365
And the only thing that was stolen
was some computers and a hard drive.

566
00:33:30,485 --> 00:33:33,045
It sounds like a professional hit.

567
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:35,485
What do we know about this guard?

568
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:40,205
Apart from taking an early retirement,
you mean?

569
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:48,229
http://hiqve.com/

570
00:33:55,365 --> 00:33:58,965
- Hello.
- Hello. Who are you?

571
00:33:59,085 --> 00:34:00,845
It's OK, Ryan.

572
00:34:03,605 --> 00:34:05,885
Thanks for agreeing to see me, Denise.

573
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:09,125
I know it must be hard
with me representing the accused.

574
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:12,845
No, it's not. Please, come in.

575
00:34:14,565 --> 00:34:16,245
Take a seat.

576
00:34:16,365 --> 00:34:18,205
I'll put the kettle on.

577
00:34:28,845 --> 00:34:33,765
Fridays are notoriously quiet in here.

578
00:34:33,885 --> 00:34:36,125
Well, you wouldn't want it
any other way, would you?

579
00:34:36,245 --> 00:34:38,485
I mean,
you bought the place for tax, right?

580
00:34:38,605 --> 00:34:40,925
A tax write-off? No.

581
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,045
This is my only investment.

582
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,885
You're shitting me, right?

583
00:34:46,005 --> 00:34:48,725
A restaurant? A nightclub, maybe.

584
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:51,285
Seating capacity's 80.

585
00:34:51,405 --> 00:34:55,645
Staff, a wanky chef, 320K a year.

586
00:34:55,765 --> 00:34:58,685
Rent - 9.5K a week.

587
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,085
1.95 mil loss split...
How many partners are there?

588
00:35:02,205 --> 00:35:04,245
- Five.
- That's beautiful, mate.

589
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:07,445
You're getting a 390 grand
annual tax writedown.

590
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:10,565
I don't pay tax.
I haven't paid tax for 12 years.

591
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:13,925
So what's the plan?
Won't be missed back at work this arvo.

592
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:18,445
Well, as it so happens,
I'm defending these two knuckleheads

593
00:35:18,565 --> 00:35:22,005
who are accused of stealing your laptop,
amongst other things.

594
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,485
So?

595
00:35:23,605 --> 00:35:27,325
Well, mate, unless those laptops were
petrol-powered with piston engines,

596
00:35:27,445 --> 00:35:29,285
I doubt my blokes
could even switch 'em on.

597
00:35:29,405 --> 00:35:33,125
Well... you know, fuck me,
probably after the drug money.

598
00:35:33,245 --> 00:35:35,445
What's a computer worth
out there in Shitsville?

599
00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:37,925
What happens on your floor?

600
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:41,965
Mate, they were caught red-handed,
on tape.

601
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:44,085
Pour lighter fuel on 'em
and give me a match,

602
00:35:44,205 --> 00:35:46,405
but don't fucking ask for my help
getting them off.

603
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:50,125
Today, Marcel will be cooking
this line-caught wild salmon

604
00:35:50,245 --> 00:35:51,765
in three ways.

605
00:35:51,885 --> 00:35:53,685
First, in a chicory fog

606
00:35:53,805 --> 00:35:56,925
with a reduction of sea urchin
and wattle nettle jus...

607
00:35:57,045 --> 00:35:58,525
Nah, I don't want any of this shit.

608
00:35:58,645 --> 00:36:01,085
Just get the cook
to knock us up a burger, pal.

609
00:36:01,205 --> 00:36:02,885
Excellent choice, sir.

610
00:36:15,325 --> 00:36:18,045
Felicity's saying you want a word.

611
00:36:18,165 --> 00:36:20,325
Do I? Why do I want to do that?

612
00:36:26,645 --> 00:36:28,885
What am I looking at?

613
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:30,645
Office furniture.

614
00:36:30,765 --> 00:36:32,445
OK...

615
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,565
It's what this is all about.

616
00:36:34,685 --> 00:36:36,085
Office furniture?

617
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:38,245
Mainly a desk, this time.

618
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:42,005
It's a sort of,
uh... little bonus super.

619
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:44,165
We sell at the markets.

620
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:50,965
Right... so... you're prepared to steal
from Australia's second richest woman

621
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:54,325
for the sake of a couple hundred bucks
worth of tax-free super.

622
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:58,325
See this chair?
15 grand this chair cost.

623
00:36:58,445 --> 00:37:00,405
15 grand for a bloody chair.

624
00:37:00,525 --> 00:37:02,965
Yeah, but then it's gonna
be reported stolen, isn't it?

625
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:05,645
No. Upstairs they don't notice.

626
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,645
They just say 'Get rid of this desk,
I want a bigger one,'

627
00:37:08,765 --> 00:37:15,765
or some hot shot say ‘Change my office,
I go Japan-style now.'

628
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:18,565
Well, hey, they don't ask
what happened to it.

629
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:22,845
It just sits there and then
after a little while we...

630
00:37:26,085 --> 00:37:29,205
Vernon and Phil were meant to
be getting a desk on the night.

631
00:37:29,325 --> 00:37:33,525
Well... well... Vern injure his back.

632
00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:38,765
I'm taking it none of you
have read The Art Of War by Sun Tzu.

633
00:37:41,165 --> 00:37:45,965
So the security guard, was he involved
in this heist of the century?

634
00:37:46,085 --> 00:37:48,525
He's the one who is retiring.

635
00:37:48,645 --> 00:37:50,765
This was to be his bonus.

636
00:37:50,885 --> 00:37:52,245
So who killed him?

637
00:37:52,365 --> 00:37:54,325
We don't know. But not them.

638
00:37:54,445 --> 00:37:56,165
They're best mates.

639
00:37:57,845 --> 00:38:01,725
Oh, I might have talked to that bloke
once or twice,

640
00:38:01,845 --> 00:38:03,885
now, come to think of it.

641
00:38:04,005 --> 00:38:05,365
Rod, you say his name was?

642
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:07,165
He wasn't really a friend, though.

643
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,605
Then this will surprise you.

644
00:38:09,725 --> 00:38:12,805
That was his coffin
you were carrying at his funeral.

645
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:15,365
Guys, I went to Rod's house.

646
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:17,565
I met his wife and son.

647
00:38:17,685 --> 00:38:19,245
Come on!

648
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:23,085
If the company knows Rod was involved...

649
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:24,845
Whoever Rod is.

650
00:38:24,965 --> 00:38:26,925
..Denise won't get a bloody thing.

651
00:38:27,045 --> 00:38:29,365
All Rod's super - gone.

652
00:38:29,485 --> 00:38:33,165
You don't know the people we work for.
They eat blokes like us for breakfast.

653
00:38:33,285 --> 00:38:35,845
For God's sake, do you think
we'd still be working at our age

654
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:37,565
if we were paid properly?

655
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:42,605
Right. So it's all about
protecting Denise's interests.

656
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:46,525
The cops said he was killed at 1:21am.

657
00:38:46,645 --> 00:38:48,045
I was in bed at 1 o'clock.

658
00:38:48,165 --> 00:38:51,765
Guys, you have to tell them
Rod was part of this.

659
00:38:51,885 --> 00:38:53,365
It proves you didn't kill him.

660
00:38:53,485 --> 00:38:55,565
No. Not if it hurts Denise
and young Ryan.

661
00:38:55,685 --> 00:38:58,645
Now, I mean, you've seen 'em -
how are they gonna make it?

662
00:38:58,765 --> 00:39:00,845
What is this, a lemming convention?

663
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:04,605
Fellas, you're gonna spend
the rest of your days in the slammer.

664
00:39:06,045 --> 00:39:10,205
Oh, Barnyard, if we're gonna have
a whisker of a hope here,

665
00:39:10,325 --> 00:39:12,885
choice of jury is gonna be vital.

666
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:15,405
Age is everything.

667
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:20,125
Your Honour, the Crown will present
the jury with actual visual evidence

668
00:39:20,245 --> 00:39:21,885
confirming the break-in

669
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:25,845
and ruthless, cold-blooded murder
of Roderick Howley,

670
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:29,525
a security guard gunned down
by these two men,

671
00:39:29,645 --> 00:39:32,365
just five weeks shy of his retirement.

672
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:39,725
Forgive me, Your Honour,

673
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:41,965
touch of the old lumbago.

674
00:39:43,485 --> 00:39:46,325
Er, Your Honour, folks of the jury,

675
00:39:46,445 --> 00:39:49,645
now, I won't, uh... won't take up
too much of your time

676
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:52,405
with my opening natter.

677
00:39:52,525 --> 00:39:54,925
Been a funny old few weeks for me.

678
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:57,885
It's taken me back
to more innocent times,

679
00:39:58,005 --> 00:40:00,005
when I was a little tyke

680
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:03,845
and the family would gather round
the old warm ray

681
00:40:03,965 --> 00:40:06,885
toasting jaffles,
watching the Val Doonican hour

682
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,045
on the old black-and-white,

683
00:40:09,165 --> 00:40:12,245
listening to Dad's hoary old war tales.

684
00:40:14,885 --> 00:40:17,685
Great days. Simple days.

685
00:40:17,805 --> 00:40:19,485
Mr Greene.

686
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:21,605
Forgive me, Your Honour,

687
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:26,725
but, uh, this is very much
the world that my clients come from.

688
00:40:26,845 --> 00:40:32,525
Now, folks... I encourage you
to have a look at my clients here.

689
00:40:32,645 --> 00:40:35,285
Now, do they look like
hardened criminals,

690
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:36,885
or do they look like a couple of coves

691
00:40:37,005 --> 00:40:39,165
you might find
at a church progressive dinner?

692
00:40:39,285 --> 00:40:43,485
Sure, they were up to a bit of mischief
on the night in question.

693
00:40:43,605 --> 00:40:46,845
Now, they don't deny that
and, by gee, they regret it.

694
00:40:46,965 --> 00:40:50,325
But, for them, it was a bit of a prank,
you see.

695
00:40:50,445 --> 00:40:56,245
Uh, what they vehemently maintain,
and we will prove,

696
00:40:56,365 --> 00:41:01,765
is that they did not murder
Roderick Howley.

697
00:41:01,885 --> 00:41:03,685
God, he has to be joking.

698
00:41:03,805 --> 00:41:06,405
Now, there you are, you see?

699
00:41:06,525 --> 00:41:08,005
I promised I'd be brief

700
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:10,645
and I've been flappin' my gums
about Val Doonican...

701
00:41:12,245 --> 00:41:13,765
today.

702
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:17,165
Hope you won't hold that
against my clients.

703
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:26,725
We know the time of death
to be 1:21am.

704
00:41:26,845 --> 00:41:28,925
The guard managed
to push his way to the lift well

705
00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:30,525
and the camera filmed the shooting.

706
00:41:30,645 --> 00:41:33,845
And this is precisely the time
that we have these two hooded men

707
00:41:33,965 --> 00:41:36,325
brandishing a weapon
inside the building?

708
00:41:36,445 --> 00:41:37,925
Correct.

709
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:39,805
Yes.

710
00:41:39,925 --> 00:41:43,205
Not quite correct, is it, Detective?

711
00:41:43,325 --> 00:41:49,125
The footage of Phil and Vern entering
the building was taken at 12:03am -

712
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:52,845
1 hour and 18 minutes
before the time of death.

713
00:41:52,965 --> 00:41:56,325
That's more correct, isn't it?

714
00:41:56,445 --> 00:41:58,005
Now, Your Honour,

715
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:04,485
unfortunately much of the security
footage is, uh, mysteriously missing,

716
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,165
but we do have this bit here.

717
00:42:07,285 --> 00:42:08,765
If I can...

718
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:14,685
What the...? What the...?

719
00:42:22,765 --> 00:42:25,885
Now, Detective,
I don't have my specs with me,

720
00:42:26,005 --> 00:42:28,725
but would you be so kind
as to tell me what time that says there?

721
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:30,725
12:28am.

722
00:42:30,845 --> 00:42:32,605
Correct.

723
00:42:32,725 --> 00:42:38,605
And, uh, Detective, would you say
that the guard appears to be still alive

724
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:40,245
at this juncture?

725
00:42:40,365 --> 00:42:42,805
Now, I know that calls for
some speculation on your part,

726
00:42:42,925 --> 00:42:45,245
but the man does appear
to be jiggling about.

727
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:48,085
Yes. We believe
the accused tied him up...

728
00:42:48,205 --> 00:42:50,885
Mr Greene, please.

729
00:42:53,285 --> 00:42:55,845
..and then made their way
to the 23rd floor,

730
00:42:55,965 --> 00:42:58,125
in which time the guard
managed to pursue them,

731
00:42:58,245 --> 00:43:01,285
whereupon they turned on him,
discharged their weapon, killing him.

732
00:43:01,405 --> 00:43:04,565
Oh, gee whiz,
well, then, my clients are guilty.

733
00:43:04,685 --> 00:43:06,325
Sorry to hear that, boys.

734
00:43:06,445 --> 00:43:12,045
Detective, if you would be so kind as to
play the actual footage that shows this.

735
00:43:12,165 --> 00:43:15,325
- Well, there is none.
- I beg your... I didn't quite...

736
00:43:15,445 --> 00:43:19,045
It's missing. We only have footage
of the guard waiting for the lift

737
00:43:19,165 --> 00:43:20,965
and the gunshot coming from the dark.

738
00:43:21,085 --> 00:43:22,565
And so what you're saying

739
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:25,685
is that the rest of this
is pure conjecture on your part.

740
00:43:25,805 --> 00:43:30,645
We have the accused in hoods,
on tape, brandishing their weapons.

741
00:43:30,765 --> 00:43:32,245
Who else would have killed him?

742
00:43:32,365 --> 00:43:35,565
Excellent question, and it's a shame
you didn't ask it at the time.

743
00:43:35,685 --> 00:43:37,685
At this point, I find myself wondering

744
00:43:37,805 --> 00:43:40,725
if you ever saw the episode
of Perry Mason where...

745
00:43:40,845 --> 00:43:42,245
You Honour, please.

746
00:43:42,365 --> 00:43:46,645
Yes, I think we have well and truly
overplayed that card, Mr Greene.

747
00:43:46,765 --> 00:43:48,245
Your Honour,

748
00:43:48,365 --> 00:43:51,445
uh, Detective, my point is

749
00:43:51,565 --> 00:43:55,885
that you have never found the gun
that killed Roderick Howley,

750
00:43:56,005 --> 00:43:58,845
and you have absolutely no evidence

751
00:43:58,965 --> 00:44:04,405
that my clients were in the TWE building
at 1:21am.

752
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:07,725
You may answer ‘correct' if you wish.

753
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,445
OK. You don't deserve a thing,

754
00:44:16,565 --> 00:44:19,125
but I'm going to give you 20 grand
from the sale of the house.

755
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:21,805
But if you argue with me
or if you dare complain...

756
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,685
- Wendy, that is just not fair.
- 19,000.

757
00:44:23,805 --> 00:44:26,085
OK, my point is this,
and it's a legal one.

758
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,725
- 18,000.
- OK, just listen to me.

759
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:29,205
- Hear me out...
-17.

760
00:44:29,325 --> 00:44:31,885
And I'm going to start going down now
in multiples of two.

761
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:33,525
- OK, it's just...
- 16.

762
00:44:33,645 --> 00:44:35,725
Would you like a drink?

763
00:44:35,845 --> 00:44:37,485
Are you OK?

764
00:44:37,605 --> 00:44:40,325
Just... minor argument with Roger.

765
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:42,565
No... I'm not here on the rebound!

766
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:44,485
He's been under a lot of pressure.

767
00:44:44,605 --> 00:44:48,845
Pressure? The man's an osteopath,
he rubs people's backs.

768
00:44:48,965 --> 00:44:50,565
He's not just an osteopath.

769
00:44:50,685 --> 00:44:52,165
He runs a huge clinic,

770
00:44:52,285 --> 00:44:56,005
he's got every living sports star
in the country after him 24 hours a day,

771
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:58,645
and our argument was over me
wanting to give you anything.

772
00:44:58,765 --> 00:45:04,205
OK. Look, I don't blame you for
wanting to move on and start anew.

773
00:45:04,325 --> 00:45:07,485
Alright? God knows
I was beating myself up

774
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:10,285
every day in prison while I was there.

775
00:45:10,405 --> 00:45:12,685
So, you know, you, Fuzz, moving...

776
00:45:12,805 --> 00:45:15,485
It's of no value going over this now.
I've moved on. OK?

777
00:45:15,605 --> 00:45:17,205
- So should you.
- Right.

778
00:45:17,325 --> 00:45:19,285
And that's what
the 20 grand's all about.

779
00:45:19,405 --> 00:45:20,885
14, soon to be 12.

780
00:45:21,005 --> 00:45:22,525
I'll send you the money tomorrow.

781
00:45:22,645 --> 00:45:24,365
Oh, come on, it's 20 grand. You said...

782
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:26,365
-12.
-20...

783
00:45:26,485 --> 00:45:27,925
Fuck.

784
00:45:28,925 --> 00:45:32,085
I thought there wasn't
any security footage from the car park.

785
00:45:32,205 --> 00:45:34,565
Apparently, they managed
to retrieve some.

786
00:45:34,685 --> 00:45:36,765
Well, that's very convenient, isn't it?

787
00:45:36,885 --> 00:45:38,525
Who's 'they'? The police?

788
00:45:38,645 --> 00:45:41,205
No. Some technicians at TWE.

789
00:45:42,525 --> 00:45:44,605
Sometimes we get a break.

790
00:45:44,725 --> 00:45:46,085
Yeah.

791
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:48,845
And sometimes
we get handfed a crock of shit

792
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:51,805
on a bed
of homegrown astringent arugula.

793
00:45:51,925 --> 00:45:55,525
Well, either way,
it's bad news for your clients.

794
00:45:55,645 --> 00:45:58,245
It puts them in the building
at the time of the death.

795
00:45:58,365 --> 00:46:02,565
So... do you want to change their plea?

796
00:46:02,685 --> 00:46:04,125
They didn't do it.

797
00:46:04,245 --> 00:46:07,005
And you're wasting your time
if you think they'll rat on a mate.

798
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:09,645
I've got an expert
reviewing all the videotapes,

799
00:46:09,765 --> 00:46:12,525
but that's a long straw.

800
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,205
You should go home, mate.

801
00:46:14,325 --> 00:46:17,045
You really look like shit -
even I can see that.

802
00:46:17,165 --> 00:46:19,405
Oh, thanks.

803
00:46:19,525 --> 00:46:22,925
Maybe I should plead guilty
and spend the next ten inside.

804
00:46:25,245 --> 00:46:27,125
- See youse.
- See ya, Barnyard.

805
00:46:27,245 --> 00:46:28,725
- Goodnight.
- Night.

806
00:46:32,485 --> 00:46:35,285
So that's it, is it? All over.

807
00:46:35,405 --> 00:46:38,165
Job done, stick in your bill,
let's go eat some spatchcock.

808
00:46:39,165 --> 00:46:43,245
Oh, hello, what are we, back in Paris,
manning the battlements again?

809
00:46:43,365 --> 00:46:44,685
What do you want me to do?

810
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:47,125
I've done Bing Crosby and cardigans
and fondue sets -

811
00:46:47,245 --> 00:46:48,725
I've only got Nana Mouskouri left.

812
00:46:48,845 --> 00:46:50,805
You know they are innocent.

813
00:46:50,925 --> 00:46:53,005
Ask yourself,
who has the money and resources

814
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:56,325
to secure and then change time code
on security footage?

815
00:46:56,445 --> 00:46:59,165
And why would they do it
for a few stolen computers?

816
00:46:59,285 --> 00:47:00,805
Why would they kill someone?

817
00:47:00,925 --> 00:47:03,165
Because something went wrong. OK?

818
00:47:03,285 --> 00:47:07,485
I don't know where or how,
but this was a monumental fuck-up.

819
00:47:07,605 --> 00:47:10,925
Tikki Wendon
is trying to build a new casino...

820
00:47:11,045 --> 00:47:13,725
Yeah, let's all get on
the 'Tikki Wendon is Satan' bus.

821
00:47:13,845 --> 00:47:17,085
What, you think there's no connection?
This happened on one of her floors.

822
00:47:17,205 --> 00:47:22,165
When did you people of the Left
become so kind of tragic and desperate

823
00:47:22,285 --> 00:47:24,125
and conspiratorial and...?

824
00:47:24,245 --> 00:47:28,685
You used to be so kind of cool
and... with your sunglasses

825
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,525
and your cigarettes.

826
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:33,605
They came to my apartment.

827
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,605
Who?

828
00:47:35,725 --> 00:47:38,085
Vern and Phil. I remember now.

829
00:47:38,205 --> 00:47:40,365
They wanted to watch
the UK Premier League.

830
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:43,125
Their set was broken.
It was a little after 1am, I think.

831
00:47:43,245 --> 00:47:44,805
No, no, no. That didn't happen.

832
00:47:44,925 --> 00:47:46,685
- I'm a witness.
- Yeah, no, you're not.

833
00:47:46,805 --> 00:47:49,125
It was Chelsea versus Wolvenhampton.

834
00:47:49,245 --> 00:47:50,645
You have to put me in the stand.

835
00:47:50,765 --> 00:47:53,205
Wolvenhampton.
There is no Wolvenhampton.

836
00:47:53,325 --> 00:47:56,565
It's Wolverhampton and they're not
in the Premier League anymore.

837
00:47:56,685 --> 00:47:58,845
- You're not doing this.
- OK, I was...

838
00:47:58,965 --> 00:48:00,365
This is not gonna happen.

839
00:48:00,485 --> 00:48:03,685
You are not gonna perjure yourself,
you're not gonna perjure me. OK?

840
00:48:03,805 --> 00:48:08,605
I cannot do it. And they will
nail your arse to the floor.

841
00:48:11,085 --> 00:48:13,925
Right, so maybe I was in a car...

842
00:48:14,045 --> 00:48:16,405
- No.
- ..driving to...

843
00:48:16,525 --> 00:48:19,805
- It was a dark and rainy night.
- Not gonna listen.

844
00:48:19,925 --> 00:48:21,285
La-la-la!

845
00:48:21,405 --> 00:48:23,805
I stand corrected,
it was a cloudless night...

846
00:48:23,925 --> 00:48:26,765
- La-la-la-la...
- Unusually warm for that time of year.

847
00:48:26,885 --> 00:48:28,285
A low of 19.

848
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,085
Mr Powell, you're gonna have to
bear with me a little bit here,

849
00:48:31,205 --> 00:48:36,725
I'm afraid I'm a bit of a drongo
when it comes to matters technological.

850
00:48:36,845 --> 00:48:39,245
Every time my telly breaks down,

851
00:48:39,365 --> 00:48:42,845
I keep thinking of that
dear old Peter, Paul and Mary song

852
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:44,565
If I Had a Hammer.

853
00:48:47,285 --> 00:48:49,605
Mr Greene.

854
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:55,165
Now, Mr Powell, you're the expert,
you've seen the tape -

855
00:48:55,285 --> 00:48:57,325
what do you make of it?

856
00:48:57,445 --> 00:48:59,725
The time code clearly brightens
and becomes sharper

857
00:48:59,845 --> 00:49:01,205
in the section in question.

858
00:49:01,325 --> 00:49:03,765
And, um, this is the funny bit,

859
00:49:03,885 --> 00:49:07,845
the font itself
looks like Claridion Bold

860
00:49:07,965 --> 00:49:09,405
and not Vestigon Light,

861
00:49:09,525 --> 00:49:12,525
which is the case
with the rest of the footage.

862
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:16,565
But, um, Mr Powell,
what exactly are you saying here?

863
00:49:16,685 --> 00:49:19,965
The security tape
may well have been tampered with.

864
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:22,925
Tampered with? Wowie.

865
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:25,645
Thank you.

866
00:49:25,765 --> 00:49:28,805
Your Honour,
‘could have been tampered with'?

867
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:30,525
What does that mean?

868
00:49:30,645 --> 00:49:32,365
Was it, or wasn't it?

869
00:49:32,485 --> 00:49:34,565
Well, Your Honour,

870
00:49:34,685 --> 00:49:39,805
now, we're not saying that the tape
unequivocally has been tampered with,

871
00:49:39,925 --> 00:49:44,085
we are merely demonstrating
that it's possible.

872
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:49,645
I'd like to call to the stand
Felicity Finnane.

873
00:49:49,765 --> 00:49:53,965
I work in a drug rehabilitation centre
with problem youth in Liverpool.

874
00:49:54,085 --> 00:49:56,765
I worked late on the night of June 21.

875
00:49:56,885 --> 00:49:59,325
Had a really bad day
and was driving home

876
00:49:59,445 --> 00:50:01,325
and my car just died.

877
00:50:01,445 --> 00:50:03,045
At what time was this?

878
00:50:03,165 --> 00:50:05,445
Just after 11:30pm.

879
00:50:05,565 --> 00:50:07,965
I was terrified.

880
00:50:08,085 --> 00:50:09,445
My phone was dead

881
00:50:09,565 --> 00:50:12,165
and I didn't want to try
and find a phone at that time of night.

882
00:50:12,285 --> 00:50:17,765
No. A drop-dead beautiful woman
all alone on the side of the road -

883
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:19,685
who can blame her?

884
00:50:21,245 --> 00:50:25,925
And suddenly, out of nowhere,
these angels appeared.

885
00:50:26,045 --> 00:50:27,525
By ‘angels', you mean...?

886
00:50:27,645 --> 00:50:30,725
Those two lovely men over there,
in an old ute.

887
00:50:30,845 --> 00:50:34,125
They fixed the - what was it? -
the fuel line, I think.

888
00:50:34,245 --> 00:50:35,925
What time was this?

889
00:50:36,045 --> 00:50:38,045
Just before one o'clock.

890
00:50:38,165 --> 00:50:41,005
The gentlemen wouldn't let me
get out of my car ‘cause it was cold,

891
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:42,885
so I listened to the 1am news.

892
00:50:43,005 --> 00:50:47,445
Miss Finnane, I need you
to be absolutely clear about this,

893
00:50:47,565 --> 00:50:51,765
because the prosecution's
entire murder case

894
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:59,605
hinges on the fact that these two men
were in the TWE Tower at 1:21am.

895
00:50:59,725 --> 00:51:04,725
Well, that's impossible.
They were with me.

896
00:51:07,325 --> 00:51:09,005
Thank you, Your Honour.

897
00:51:10,085 --> 00:51:13,645
Are you absolutely certain
that it was these men?

898
00:51:13,765 --> 00:51:18,085
It was late at night, it was wet,
bad street lighting.

899
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:19,725
I have perfect eyesight.

900
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:23,605
Or are you suggesting
all older people look the same?

901
00:51:31,725 --> 00:51:34,845
Is it any wonder
that the thinking public of this country

902
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:37,685
have had an absolute gutful
of our legal system,

903
00:51:37,805 --> 00:51:40,205
when two crims -
and that's what they are -

904
00:51:40,325 --> 00:51:43,485
are captured on tape for all to see
breaking into one of Australia's...?

905
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:47,365
I've moved my idiot stepson out of
the building where he can do no harm.

906
00:51:47,485 --> 00:51:50,685
I want this mess closed down
with minimum fuss.

907
00:51:50,805 --> 00:51:53,885
Six months home detention?
Well, why not...

908
00:51:54,005 --> 00:51:55,485
Oh, do shut up.

909
00:51:55,605 --> 00:51:57,405
..send them to a health spa
for six months?

910
00:51:57,525 --> 00:52:00,605
I am sickened, I'm angry,
and I'm Cal McGregor.

911
00:52:00,725 --> 00:52:02,285
We're out, everyone.

912
00:52:02,405 --> 00:52:04,125
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

913
00:52:06,325 --> 00:52:08,925
- What an honour.
- The man of the hour.

914
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:11,205
Tikki. Mwah. Mwah.

915
00:52:11,325 --> 00:52:14,525
Cal. Everyone loves what you're doing.

916
00:52:14,645 --> 00:52:16,485
And I've got a surprise for you.

917
00:52:16,605 --> 00:52:18,685
Brand-new producer for the show.

918
00:52:20,365 --> 00:52:23,165
Great. Great.

919
00:52:23,285 --> 00:52:26,765
Isn't it? A perfect pairing of minds.

920
00:52:26,885 --> 00:52:30,285
He's a bit of a lonely chump,
my stepson.

921
00:52:30,405 --> 00:52:32,405
He needs your guidance.

922
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:35,085
I want you to become
a trusted confidant.

923
00:52:36,245 --> 00:52:38,565
Oh, and, pet,
I want you to call me every day

924
00:52:38,685 --> 00:52:41,405
and tell me everything
he does and says.

925
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,045
Hmm?

926
00:52:51,245 --> 00:52:57,565
You were Katherine Hepburn and Renoir,
Thelonious Monk, all rolled into one.

927
00:52:57,685 --> 00:52:59,805
- You were a work of art.
- I was good, wasn't 1?

928
00:52:59,925 --> 00:53:01,205
Mm.

929
00:53:01,325 --> 00:53:04,245
You were pretty good too...
for a lawyer.

930
00:53:05,645 --> 00:53:08,885
- I should head back.
- Really?

931
00:53:09,005 --> 00:53:14,085
I thought we might...
you know, celebrate,

932
00:53:14,205 --> 00:53:16,405
have a little something to eat.

933
00:53:17,525 --> 00:53:19,525
I suppose we could drink some more wine,

934
00:53:19,645 --> 00:53:23,005
open up to each other
over Wagyu duck's breast.

935
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:25,365
You say that like it's a bad thing.

936
00:53:25,485 --> 00:53:27,405
You could reveal your vulnerable side

937
00:53:27,525 --> 00:53:30,325
and later outside, with the moon up,
we could kiss.

938
00:53:30,445 --> 00:53:31,925
And hey-presto,

939
00:53:32,045 --> 00:53:33,845
we're humping away in your bed -

940
00:53:33,965 --> 00:53:36,365
all because you got
my late brother's friends off

941
00:53:36,485 --> 00:53:38,325
for a murder they didn't commit.

942
00:53:38,445 --> 00:53:40,765
Was that your little plan?

943
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:47,485
Oh... look, you skipped
so many of the finer details, but, um...

944
00:53:47,605 --> 00:53:50,765
I don't do lawyers. Sorry.

945
00:53:50,885 --> 00:53:53,445
It's a French barricade thing.

946
00:53:55,725 --> 00:53:57,405
But I am grateful.

947
00:54:04,245 --> 00:54:06,085
Sometimes, very rarely,

948
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:10,365
I go out with the sons of people
who run hardware shops,

949
00:54:10,485 --> 00:54:12,245
but not often.

950
00:54:13,245 --> 00:54:15,125
When might that be?

951
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,725
Post the Revolution.

952
00:54:20,165 --> 00:54:21,765
I know where you live.

953
00:54:46,925 --> 00:54:52,525
You're right - I am a morbidly obese,
non-literate fraud...

954
00:54:53,805 --> 00:54:55,525
..80 let's do this.

955
00:55:45,405 --> 00:55:47,925
There's a blob
sitting on the end of the bed.

956
00:55:56,205 --> 00:55:57,805
Mm...

957
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:59,829
