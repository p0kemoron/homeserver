1
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:05,251
Would you please come with me, Sir?

2
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,668
Would you come with me, Sir?

3
00:05:28,376 --> 00:05:29,585
Hands in front.

4
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:41,460
Hands behind your head.

5
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:43,501
Behind your head and turn around.

6
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,501
Open your mouth. Open your mouth.

7
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,710
Anything on the watch-list, George?

8
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,085
No flags. He's clean.

9
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,751
Okay. Mr. Khan, we are done here.

10
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:15,418
You can go.

11
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,501
Put your stuff in your bag.

12
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:22,668
Gone. It's gone … my last
flight to Washington DC has left.

13
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:25,668
The last American
Airlines flight has left.

14
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:28,543
The next flight leaves after
seven hours and five minutes.

15
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:31,543
United 59. United … United 59.

16
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:37,210
It leaves in the morning at 6.10.
Ticket $366 … it costs $366.

17
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,168
I don't have the money.

18
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:41,960
I have to take a bus
to Washington DC now.

19
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,626
Okay. I have to take a
bus to Washington DC now.

20
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:47,710
Why are you going to Washington DC?

21
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:51,751
I am going to meet the
President of the United States.

22
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:57,210
Why is that? Is he
a friend of yours?

23
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:00,668
Oh, no, no, no, no. He's
not a friend. No, no, no.

24
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:02,876
I have something to say to him.

25
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:05,251
Oh yeah?
- Yes.

26
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,085
Well, tell the President
something from me too then.

27
00:07:09,085 --> 00:07:13,710
Okay. Okay.
- Tell him I said, howdy.

28
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:16,626
Howdy? How … Okay.

29
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,126
Pen?

30
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,293
J. Marshall.

31
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,918
John.
- John.

32
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:30,210
John.
- John. John Marshall says howdy.

33
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,085
Howdy. Okay. Howdy.

34
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,835
Yes. Okay. Okay.
John Marshall says …

35
00:07:35,835 --> 00:07:38,918
But I have … my own
message to give to him first.

36
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,626
Oh yeah? What is that?

37
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,335
You know where Osama is?

38
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,668
Oh, no, no, no, no. No. This
is not my message. No, no, no.

39
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,960
What is your message, Mr. Khan?

40
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:52,626
I have to say to him …

41
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:57,626
My name is Khan. And
I am not a terrorist.

42
00:08:56,418 --> 00:08:59,335
May Allah bless this
letter I'm writing to you.

43
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:02,126
The book 'Different Minds' says …

44
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:05,626
… that people like us can't
express their emotions in words.

45
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:08,085
But we can write them easily.

46
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:11,460
I can fill thousands of pages,
millions of times with …

47
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:13,376
'I love you, Mandira.'

48
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:16,001
But not once could I say it to you.

49
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:18,251
Perhaps that's why
you are angry with me.

50
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:21,335
I had promised you that I
would meet the President …

51
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:23,793
… so, my attempts are on.

52
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:28,168
Meanwhile whenever I have time,
I will write all …

53
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,376
… that I couldn't say to you.

54
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:34,918
And then, you will love me again.

55
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,710
My Abbu (father) Dilawar
Amanullah Khan worked for …

56
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,751
… the S.T. workshop in Borivali.

57
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:49,835
He took me with
him to work everyday.

58
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:52,960
And left me to play in the garage.

59
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,751
I know how to repair
broken things since then.

60
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,210
Strangely, I could
never repair Abbu.

61
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:04,001
Hey, is this your dad's place?

62
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:05,918
Go home and kill your time.

63
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:07,251
Kill? Kill?

64
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:08,960
Get out now! Out!

65
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:23,668
You fool! Idiot! Ruined my clothes!

66
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:34,043
Ammi … Ammi … Ammi …

67
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:37,126
Zakir is sleeping.

68
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:38,293
What's this?

69
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:40,001
'Kill time.'
- How did you get so wet?

70
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:42,501
'Kill time.' I want to 'kill time.'
- What?

71
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:45,043
Abdul Workshop asked me to
go home and 'kill time.'

72
00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:47,210
How do I do that?

73
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,501
'Kill time?'

74
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:52,501
Is that what the devil told you?

75
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:55,293
Okay. I'll teach you
how to 'kill time.'

76
00:10:55,501 --> 00:11:01,126
Like this. Like this.

77
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:04,585
This way.

78
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:12,251
Come on, Rizu.

79
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:15,168
Give me a hug … just once?

80
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:18,376
Come on. Come on.

81
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,126
My Ammi (mother) Razia Khan.

82
00:11:24,126 --> 00:11:26,543
I feel peace when you hug me.

83
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,543
She was from Jalalpur, UP.

84
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,126
She embroidered clothes.

85
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:36,710
No doctor could tell her
why I was the way I was.

86
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,960
But Ammi … She never
felt the need to know why.

87
00:11:40,126 --> 00:11:42,626
I don't know how, but
she found a way to know me.

88
00:11:42,626 --> 00:11:44,626
Just like you.

89
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,960
Fools! All of them!!

90
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,376
Each one of them should
be shot dead mercilessly!

91
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:56,210
Didn't even spare our women!

92
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,168
Dogs! Rogues! Idiots!

93
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:00,876
Are you guys with me?

94
00:12:00,876 --> 00:12:02,835
Rogues. All of them.

95
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:04,918
Each one of them should
be shot dead mercilessly.

96
00:12:08,668 --> 00:12:10,501
I had told you not to step out.

97
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:12,293
Now, come on. Let's eat.

98
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:14,585
Rogues. All of them.

99
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:18,543
Each one of them should
be shot dead mercilessly.

100
00:12:18,793 --> 00:12:20,335
Rogues. All of them.

101
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:21,793
What did you say?

102
00:12:21,793 --> 00:12:23,335
Rogues. All of them.

103
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:24,501
Where did you hear that?

104
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:25,793
Each one of them
should be shot dead.

105
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:26,960
Shut up!

106
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,085
Rogues. All of them.

107
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:30,168
Shut up, Rizu.

108
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:32,085
Come with me. Come.

109
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,501
Look at this.

110
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:39,501
This is you. Rizvan. Who?

111
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:41,835
Rizvan.
- Yes.

112
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:47,210
And this is the person who
has a stick in his hand.

113
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,168
And he is beating you.

114
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,251
It's bad … beating is bad.
- Yes. It's bad.

115
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:54,668
Now, this is you again, Rizvan.

116
00:12:55,835 --> 00:13:00,918
And this is the
person who has a lollipop.

117
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:02,085
And he gives it to you.

118
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:04,335
Lollipop is sweet.
It's a good thing.

119
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:06,043
Good boy.
- Good boy.

120
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:10,418
Now, tell me which one of these is
a Hindu and which one, a Muslim?

121
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:17,376
Both look alike.

122
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:19,126
Good.

123
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:22,751
Remember one thing, son.

124
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:26,751
There are only two kinds
of people in this world.

125
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:31,251
Good people who do good deeds.

126
00:13:31,793 --> 00:13:33,960
And bad people who do bad.

127
00:13:35,126 --> 00:13:37,960
That's the only
difference in human beings.

128
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,710
There's no other difference.
Understood?

129
00:13:41,543 --> 00:13:44,793
What did you understand?
Tell me. Tell me.

130
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:49,751
Good people. Bad people.
No other difference.

131
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:53,960
Ammi's lesson was not
taught in any school.

132
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,626
Not in my school at least.

133
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:13,626
Master Wadia lives somewhere here.

134
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:15,126
Give me the map.

135
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:18,668
Come fast.

136
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:25,835
Rizu, what are you doing?
Stop that and come here.

137
00:14:29,376 --> 00:14:31,626
Hang on. Coming.

138
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:37,168
Hello. I'm Razia. This
is Rizu. I mean Rizvan.

139
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,918
I have heard a lot about you.

140
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:42,501
That you are a very learned man.
You have a lot of degrees.

141
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:44,001
B.A., M.A.

142
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:45,376
Whatever!

143
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:51,126
But people say you don't do
anything. That's a good thing!

144
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:58,043
Rizu. My Rizu is a sharp boy.

145
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:02,251
So, I thought if you agree to
teach him here, in your house

146
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:05,460
That way, you can pass
your time too, isn't it?

147
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,168
What nonsense!

148
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:10,585
Mr. Wadia. Mr. Wadia. Trust me.

149
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:13,501
My Rizu is an intelligent boy.

150
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:17,085
Rizu … Talk to Mr. Wadia in English.

151
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:20,251
Speak in English. Come on.
Say something in English.

152
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:21,835
Wadia. Wadia.

153
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:25,793
Wadia family is a Parsi
family originally based in Surat.

154
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:29,043
Launji Narsolaunji Wadia
started the Wadia ship …

155
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:31,626
… building dynasty in 1736.

156
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:34,710
When he obtained a contract from
the British East India Company …

157
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,960
… for building docks
and ships in Bombay.

158
00:15:37,876 --> 00:15:39,876
Wadia. Wadia.

159
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,501
The highway man came riding …

160
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:47,001
… riding up to the old Inn-door.

161
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:53,335
The highway man came
riding up to the old Inn-door.

162
00:15:55,585 --> 00:16:04,001
Ammi … I'm hungry.
Let's go. I'm hungry.

163
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:07,501
Ammi said master
Wadia was a good man.

164
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,376
Good people did good deeds.

165
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:14,835
Master Wadia taught
me a lot of things.

166
00:16:14,835 --> 00:16:18,418
About books. And about life too.

167
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:25,210
Rizvan. Rizvan, don't come here.

168
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:28,626
There's too much water.
Go home! Go home!

169
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:38,835
Mr. Wadia. What are
you doing? Come out!

170
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:42,001
Your pupil is amazing!

171
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,793
What's going on? Why
are you guys screaming?

172
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:50,668
Rizvan, what are you doing?
I asked you to go home.

173
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,043
Too good.

174
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:04,335
You are pumping water out.

175
00:17:04,335 --> 00:17:07,335
That's amazing. Genius. Genius.

176
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:10,626
He is my pupil. My pupil.

177
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:29,335
You think he can repair all this?

178
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:34,210
You know, Mr. Wadia?

179
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,168
My Rizu did nothing short
of a miracle near his house.

180
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:37,876
The water had filled till here.
- Mother!

181
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:40,168
One minute! The water was till here.

182
00:17:40,168 --> 00:17:43,168
Rizu fixed some motor
type of thing. One minute!

183
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:45,293
Put the motor in the water,
and the water was gone!

184
00:17:45,293 --> 00:17:47,210
I saw it with my own eyes.

185
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,293
Really?
- Yes.

186
00:17:53,501 --> 00:17:54,668
Zakir.

187
00:17:55,168 --> 00:17:56,960
You won a cup, didn't you?

188
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,876
I'm really happy about that.

189
00:18:01,168 --> 00:18:02,626
And Rizu?

190
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:06,418
Even he is happy for you.

191
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:08,960
You should be happy too.

192
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:11,085
He is your brother, isn't he?

193
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:13,668
Good boy. Wipe your tears.

194
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:15,126
Come on.

195
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:20,001
You are my good son, aren't you?

196
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:23,126
You are my good son, aren't you?

197
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,876
You are my good son, aren't you?

198
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,543
Zakir was fortunate.

199
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:32,668
He could cry.

200
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:39,626
Zakir, Rizu says it's
going to be very cold there.

201
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:42,126
You have taken everything,
right? Don't forget anything.

202
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:46,085
I will miss you, my son.

203
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:48,376
Only if you find time from
bhai (brother) will you miss me!

204
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,710
As soon as he completed 18 years,
Zakir left for America.

205
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,168
He got a scholarship
at Michigan University.

206
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:10,543
I felt very bad when he left.

207
00:19:10,876 --> 00:19:13,543
But I never told him.

208
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:18,751
And in just a few days, I
got accustomed to his absence.

209
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:21,751
Ammi. Hasina teaches
at the university.

210
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:24,918
She can't leave mid-term and come.

211
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:30,085
It's her first Eid (festival)
in the family after the wedding.

212
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:35,460
We haven't even seen her yet.
Come here, please.

213
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:38,001
Ammi.

214
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:39,835
Don't worry.

215
00:19:39,835 --> 00:19:42,126
Your immigration will
be done in a few days.

216
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:44,460
Then you will live with us.

217
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:50,418
I won't go anywhere without Rizvan.

218
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:54,251
I know that.

219
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:56,418
I'm sponsoring bhai as well.

220
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:01,876
Okay, Ammi. I have to hang
up now. I'll call later.

221
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:04,126
Yeah?

222
00:20:23,626 --> 00:20:25,918
Oh, Lord.
- Oh, lord.

223
00:20:29,543 --> 00:20:31,460
Ammi, you should sleep now.

224
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,418
Sleeping calms the mind and
provides rest to the body.

225
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:36,293
Shut up!

226
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,710
Nothing is wrong with me.

227
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:42,418
Just missing Zakir, that's all.

228
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:44,626
His laughter.

229
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:46,668
His anger.

230
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,918
The sound of his gargling.

231
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:52,085
At 7 a.m. At 2 p.m. 9 p.m.

232
00:21:15,918 --> 00:21:17,793
Enough peace?

233
00:21:18,751 --> 00:21:24,960
Please, Rizu. Two minutes?
Only two minutes.

234
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,960
Only two minutes?

235
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:37,126
1001, 1002.

236
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,835
But Mandira, the effect
of those two minutes …

237
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:46,001
… lasted only for six months,
four days and 17 hours.

238
00:21:56,626 --> 00:22:01,210
Ammi died of
congestive cardiomyopathy.

239
00:22:01,585 --> 00:22:05,543
Her heart became too
big for its own good.

240
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,835
Before dying, Ammi made me promise …

241
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:22,876
… that like Zakir, I would
make a happy life for myself.

242
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:27,293
That I would go to America.

243
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:47,210
And then I came here
to your favourite city.

244
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,876
San Francisco.

245
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:57,668
And it was scary. Very scary.

246
00:23:19,918 --> 00:23:22,251
Bhai, this is Hasina.

247
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,835
Hello, bhai.

248
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:28,126
How are you?

249
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:34,501
Hope your flight was comfortable.
- Hello.

250
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:37,876
Come on. Let's go in.

251
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,751
Hello to you too.

252
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:44,626
Zakir's wife, Hasina.

253
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,918
She was from Brooklyn, New York.

254
00:23:47,918 --> 00:23:51,501
She taught psychology
in the university here.

255
00:23:52,418 --> 00:23:55,876
She was the first to find out …

256
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,918
… that I had Asperger's Syndrome.

257
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:15,501
My fear of new places. New people.

258
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,251
My hatred for the colour
yellow and sharp sounds.

259
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:27,376
The reason for me
being so different …

260
00:24:27,376 --> 00:24:29,960
… from everyone was
defined in just two words …

261
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,918
… Asperger's Syndrome.

262
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:37,460
Take this.

263
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,710
When you look through this
it will be like watching TV.

264
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,085
TV?

265
00:24:42,085 --> 00:24:45,126
This way, you won't be
scared of new places or roads.

266
00:24:45,126 --> 00:24:46,710
Not scared?
- No.

267
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,085
Just press this button. See … try?

268
00:24:55,835 --> 00:24:58,085
I took bhai to the Autistic Society.

269
00:24:58,085 --> 00:25:00,251
Hi, Mrs. Brennan.
- Hi.

270
00:25:00,585 --> 00:25:02,210
Sorry.
- I had.

271
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,585
Mrs. Brennan there
believes that bhai is better …

272
00:25:04,585 --> 00:25:07,126
… than most people with Asperger's.

273
00:25:08,251 --> 00:25:12,043
Maybe in odd ways, but at
least he can express his feelings.

274
00:25:12,835 --> 00:25:15,751
And I think your Ammi had
a lot to with it, Zakir.

275
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,585
Good morning.
- Good morning.

276
00:25:24,085 --> 00:25:25,585
This is our office.

277
00:25:25,585 --> 00:25:27,335
Come in. Have a good look.

278
00:25:27,335 --> 00:25:28,543
Have a good look.

279
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:30,418
What are you doing? Come this way.

280
00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:33,043
What did I have when
I came to America?

281
00:25:33,043 --> 00:25:35,043
Nothing. But today?

282
00:25:35,043 --> 00:25:36,501
See for yourself.

283
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:40,251
I am the biggest dealer
for Mehnaz Herbal Products.

284
00:25:40,793 --> 00:25:44,210
Because this is America.
- America.

285
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,918
Here, the harder you work,
the more successful you get.

286
00:25:46,918 --> 00:25:50,043
America. - I have worked
very hard. Now, it's your turn.

287
00:25:50,043 --> 00:25:51,335
America.
- Okay?

288
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:52,543
Shall we? Come.

289
00:25:55,043 --> 00:25:57,001
Not that way. This way

290
00:25:57,001 --> 00:25:58,751
America.
- Come.

291
00:25:58,751 --> 00:26:02,043
These are all our products
and these are the details.

292
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:04,668
You will be given the names
and addresses of all the salons.

293
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:07,751
You will go to every one of
them and sell these. Understand?

294
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:09,918
No.
- You will.

295
00:26:18,001 --> 00:26:20,501
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products.

296
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:21,918
Mehnaz …

297
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:30,043
The rose water in the clay mask
cleans and clarifies your skin …

298
00:26:30,043 --> 00:26:33,876
… and makes you glow
like a newly-wed bride.

299
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:37,335
A newly-wed bride.

300
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:46,460
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products.
All of them.

301
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,876
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products will
make you glow like a newly-wed bride.

302
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:53,585
I'm divorced.

303
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:56,793
We have nothing for
the newly-divorced.

304
00:26:57,335 --> 00:26:59,376
Just a pimple cream won't help.

305
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:02,876
You need to cleanse your face,
and your system.

306
00:27:02,876 --> 00:27:05,835
I think that maybe I
just need a boyfriend.

307
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:08,585
Oh, no, no. You
don't need a boyfriend.

308
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,876
You need this and Jamal Gota.

309
00:27:12,085 --> 00:27:13,668
Indian laxative.

310
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:18,168
It says that the product
will reach you in seven days.

311
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:19,335
We're lying.

312
00:27:19,335 --> 00:27:21,376
It will reach you only in ten days.

313
00:28:28,751 --> 00:28:31,126
Move!

314
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:40,960
Come on! Move it!

315
00:28:42,418 --> 00:28:44,585
Come on. Get out of
the way, you freak.

316
00:28:45,335 --> 00:28:47,335
No, no, no.

317
00:28:50,335 --> 00:28:51,960
Get out of here. Come on.

318
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,376
Hey, you guys, just leave him alone.

319
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,543
Stop it.

320
00:28:54,543 --> 00:28:56,418
Stop it, okay? Just go.

321
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:58,251
Go, please.

322
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:02,168
Are you okay?

323
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:04,876
Are you scared?

324
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:07,085
It's okay.

325
00:29:07,085 --> 00:29:09,585
Look, there's nothing
wrong with being scared.

326
00:29:10,126 --> 00:29:12,168
Just don't make your fear so large …

327
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,043
… that it stops you
from achieving your goal.

328
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,335
Okay? All right, bye.

329
00:29:56,918 --> 00:29:59,293
Hello. Welcome to Karma.

330
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:00,918
I'm the manager here.

331
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:02,335
Can I help you?

332
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:06,001
Oh God.

333
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:08,585
I think you have recognised me.

334
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,168
It's all right. Don't be shy.

335
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:14,210
I am Rita Singh. Ex Miss India.

336
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:16,251
These blow-dryers …

337
00:30:16,251 --> 00:30:19,043
I am Rita Singh. Ex Miss India.

338
00:30:19,043 --> 00:30:23,668
You look old. You must have
been Miss India before I was born.

339
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,335
Okay?

340
00:30:31,293 --> 00:30:35,293
The theory of entrainment
in Physics states that …

341
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:40,210
… some specific sounds
increase the rate of your heartbeat.

342
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:48,376
For me, Mandira …

343
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:54,126
… that specific sound has always
been the sound of your laughter.

344
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:58,043
So, you were coming here?

345
00:30:58,043 --> 00:30:59,918
Don't take it personally, Rita.

346
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:02,460
I hope you've come for a haircut.

347
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:04,876
You have got great hair.
- Okay.

348
00:31:05,543 --> 00:31:07,293
Okay.
- Okay. - Take an appointment.

349
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:11,293
My name is Rizvan Khan. Khan. Khan.

350
00:31:12,168 --> 00:31:15,043
I may look a little strange to you …

351
00:31:15,043 --> 00:31:17,835
… but that's because I
have Asperger's Syndrome.

352
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:21,335
It's named after Dr. Hans Asperger.

353
00:31:21,585 --> 00:31:24,668
That doesn't mean I'm mad.

354
00:31:24,668 --> 00:31:26,668
Oh, no, no, no, no.

355
00:31:26,668 --> 00:31:28,543
I'm very intelligent.

356
00:31:28,543 --> 00:31:31,960
Very smart. Very smart.

357
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,001
But there are certain
things I don't understand.

358
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:38,626
For instance, people say when I go
to their houses, "Come, Rizvan …

359
00:31:38,626 --> 00:31:40,293
… think of it as your own house."

360
00:31:40,293 --> 00:31:43,126
But how do I do that
when the house isn't mine?

361
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:47,001
I don't understand why people
say one thing and think another.

362
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:50,293
My Ammi would say there are only
two kinds of people in the world.

363
00:31:50,293 --> 00:31:52,543
Good people and bad people.

364
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:54,126
I'm a good person.

365
00:31:54,126 --> 00:31:56,460
I do good deeds.

366
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,418
I'm here to sell Mehnaz
Herbal Beauty products.

367
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,876
I don't know how to sell.

368
00:32:00,876 --> 00:32:04,126
But my brother Zakir
tells me that's my job.

369
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,043
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty
products they are good products.

370
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,751
I have tried them all on me.

371
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:13,626
That's why my skin glows.

372
00:32:13,876 --> 00:32:17,085
Shinning like a newly-wed bride.

373
00:32:17,876 --> 00:32:20,335
Allow me … Allow me to show you …

374
00:32:20,335 --> 00:32:24,210
… all the Mehnaz Herbal
Beauty products, please.

375
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:27,293
May I?

376
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:29,626
Yes, you can.

377
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:31,001
So tell me.

378
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:32,793
Which product will
make me beautiful?

379
00:32:32,793 --> 00:32:34,085
No.

380
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,043
No product can make you beautiful.

381
00:32:37,043 --> 00:32:39,085
That's rude.
- No, no.

382
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:42,710
Beauty products can
only enhance the skin.

383
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:44,793
They cannot make you beautiful.

384
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:46,043
Wow.

385
00:32:46,043 --> 00:32:47,210
A salesman, and yet
you speak the truth?

386
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,085
Always. Always.

387
00:32:50,126 --> 00:32:51,293
How many products do you have?

388
00:32:51,293 --> 00:32:53,543
22. 22.

389
00:32:53,793 --> 00:32:56,293
Give six of each.
- Oh no, no, no. No.

390
00:32:56,293 --> 00:33:00,043
All our products expire
in three months. It dies.

391
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:04,043
You need only four.
The rest will get spoilt.

392
00:33:06,126 --> 00:33:08,043
What did you say the name was?

393
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,460
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products.

394
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,043
Your name?

395
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,710
Rizvan Khan.

396
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:16,793
Khan.

397
00:33:17,043 --> 00:33:18,418
I'm Mandira. -

398
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:21,168
Mandira.

399
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:23,835
Hi.
- Hi.

400
00:33:26,293 --> 00:33:27,501
Hi.

401
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,543
Hi.

402
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:56,001
Isn't this shocking pink
a little too shocking?

403
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:58,126
Not at all! It looks beautiful!

404
00:34:58,335 --> 00:34:59,710
Pink is so your colour.

405
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,001
Really?
- Yeah.

406
00:35:01,001 --> 00:35:02,168
I agree.

407
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,293
Hello. Hello.

408
00:35:09,293 --> 00:35:11,835
Hi. Nice colour.

409
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:14,543
Oh yes. Pink is so my colour.

410
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:17,376
Oh no, no, no. No cell phone.
No cell phone.

411
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,543
Why?

412
00:35:18,543 --> 00:35:20,126
Because bees die due to cell phones.

413
00:35:20,126 --> 00:35:22,001
Who?!
- Bees. Bees. Bees.

414
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:25,835
Cell phone signals cause bees to
lose their way home, and they die.

415
00:35:25,835 --> 00:35:27,501
They die. They die.

416
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:28,668
It's not good.

417
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,960
Because Albert Einstein has said …

418
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,293
Albert Einstein has apparently said.

419
00:35:32,293 --> 00:35:35,043
Apparently said … - That if
all the bees in the world die …

420
00:35:35,043 --> 00:35:37,335
… exactly four years
after that all men will die.

421
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:38,543
That's right. That's right.

422
00:35:38,543 --> 00:35:40,585
All men die. All men die.

423
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:44,085
Oh no. No cell phones then. If all
the men die, what will happen to me?

424
00:35:44,585 --> 00:35:45,751
You're bad.

425
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:49,960
This cream has an extra
care skin nourishing lotion …

426
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,168
… which contains Aloe Vera,
Calamine and Jojoba oil …

427
00:35:53,168 --> 00:35:56,335
… which restore the
pH scale of the skin.

428
00:35:59,585 --> 00:36:04,001
The pH is an algorithm of
the activity of hydrogen ions …

429
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:06,918
… in a solution which tells
you how acidic or basic it is.

430
00:36:06,918 --> 00:36:09,335
The exponentials of
hydrogen ions being very high …

431
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,126
… it's not practical to measure it.

432
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:15,626
It's not an absolute term,
it's just a relative.

433
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:22,835
Basically it means …
this cream is very nice.

434
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,668
Okay.
- Okay.

435
00:36:27,293 --> 00:36:30,460
I'll take it.
- Okay.

436
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:25,585
I trained for a year and then
took a further course in LA.

437
00:37:25,585 --> 00:37:27,751
I mean … But I did want to make it.

438
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:29,418
I think training
is really important.

439
00:37:29,418 --> 00:37:31,001
How can you cut
somebody's hair without it?

440
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:32,210
And that's how I came here.

441
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,501
You?

442
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,418
Were you saying something to me?

443
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:38,043
And I think you know the most
we know the most we can do is …

444
00:37:38,043 --> 00:37:40,168
… just texturise it a
little bit, thin it out. And …

445
00:37:40,168 --> 00:37:43,001
Even I want to have my
hair cut by you, Mandira.

446
00:37:43,585 --> 00:37:45,626
Yeah. I know, Rizvan. But …

447
00:37:45,626 --> 00:37:48,001
Please, please. Please
cut my hair. Please.

448
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:49,793
Yeah. And I am
dying to cut your hair.

449
00:37:49,793 --> 00:37:51,210
No, no, no, no. Don't die.
- But maybe later?

450
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:54,210
No, don't die. Just cut my hair now.

451
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,793
Rizvan …
- No, now.

452
00:38:34,918 --> 00:38:36,751
So? How is it?

453
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:40,210
Marry me.

454
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,043
Marry me.

455
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:45,210
Liked it so much?!

456
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,626
Hang on. One second.

457
00:38:46,626 --> 00:38:47,835
Marry me.
- Excuse me.

458
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:49,043
Hello?

459
00:38:49,835 --> 00:38:51,001
Sameer.

460
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:52,251
Hi. Reached home?

461
00:38:52,251 --> 00:38:54,001
Okay. Okay, I'm coming.

462
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:55,751
Bye. Love you.

463
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,376
Sameer?

464
00:39:00,543 --> 00:39:03,210
Sameer! Sameer! Sam!

465
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,501
Come on. Please, hurry up.
- Coming!

466
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:09,251
Quickly. Come on! Come on! Come on!

467
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,626
You put everything into the bag?
- Yup.

468
00:39:11,626 --> 00:39:13,376
Summer camp project?
- Yup.

469
00:39:13,376 --> 00:39:14,960
Lunch.
- Yup.

470
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,293
Soccer gear?

471
00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:17,793
I think I forgot.

472
00:39:17,793 --> 00:39:20,835
Mom, stop acting. You
forgot deliberately.

473
00:39:20,835 --> 00:39:22,126
Do you have to play soccer?

474
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,376
It's dangerous. What
if you get hurt playing?

475
00:39:23,376 --> 00:39:25,085
What if I get hurt
running this way with you?

476
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:26,251
Nothing will happen to you here.

477
00:39:26,251 --> 00:39:28,335
I'm here. Your Mom!

478
00:39:28,335 --> 00:39:30,960
Mom, stop being so dramatic.
You are such a drama queen.

479
00:39:31,126 --> 00:39:32,668
Yeah, I am.

480
00:39:32,668 --> 00:39:36,293
Okay. Almost there.
Almost there. Almost there.

481
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:37,501
Thank God. We are on time.

482
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:38,835
Okay. Bye, Mom.

483
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,126
Where's my hug? Where's my kiss?

484
00:39:41,126 --> 00:39:43,001
Stop it, Mom. I have got reputation.

485
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:44,293
Reputation.

486
00:39:44,293 --> 00:39:45,876
Bye!
- Bye!

487
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:48,960
Bye! The apple of my eye.
Love me till I die …

488
00:39:53,293 --> 00:39:55,501
Oh God. Oh shit.

489
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:02,793
Hey, Rizvan. Hi.

490
00:40:02,793 --> 00:40:05,043
Hi. Any sales appointment?

491
00:40:05,043 --> 00:40:06,376
You are divorced.

492
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:07,543
Divorced.

493
00:40:07,543 --> 00:40:09,585
Rita told me you are divorced.

494
00:40:09,585 --> 00:40:13,001
You were 19 when you
had an arranged marriage.

495
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:14,626
You came to America
with your husband.

496
00:40:14,626 --> 00:40:16,085
He harassed you a
lot for three years …

497
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:17,960
… and then left for
Australia with another woman.

498
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,876
It must take a long time to
run till Australia, right?

499
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:23,668
He divorced you from there and
didn't even pay you alimony.

500
00:40:23,668 --> 00:40:26,918
Such a beast! Slimy! Idiot!

501
00:40:26,918 --> 00:40:28,543
He hasn't called you even
once in the last four years.

502
00:40:28,543 --> 00:40:30,376
Hasn't even spoken to Sam.

503
00:40:30,376 --> 00:40:32,001
Now, where is he
going to come back …

504
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:33,710
Slimy bastard, mother …

505
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,876
Mother …

506
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,585
… I can't say the next word.

507
00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:40,626
You have said enough.

508
00:40:41,001 --> 00:40:42,835
Thank you.
- Welcome.

509
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:47,335
Marry me.
- Just go.

510
00:40:47,335 --> 00:40:49,085
Marry me.
- Just go, okay?

511
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:50,168
Marry me.

512
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:00,960
Okay.

513
00:41:04,251 --> 00:41:05,543
Mandira …
- No, Rita.

514
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:06,918
No more appointments tomorrow!

515
00:41:06,918 --> 00:41:09,251
Mrs. V is coming tomorrow and
her hair colouring takes time.

516
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:10,751
Okay. Bye.

517
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,376
Bye.
- Bye, girl.

518
00:41:24,376 --> 00:41:26,085
Rizvan, are you okay?

519
00:41:28,585 --> 00:41:31,751
No!
- What? Rizvan!

520
00:41:32,251 --> 00:41:34,543
Please …
- No …

521
00:41:34,543 --> 00:41:36,460
What happened?!

522
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:49,710
Hi.

523
00:41:50,043 --> 00:41:51,251
You run fast.

524
00:41:51,251 --> 00:41:57,001
I don't like yellow.

525
00:41:57,001 --> 00:41:58,460
Okay.
- No.

526
00:41:58,876 --> 00:42:00,043
Is that for me?

527
00:42:00,043 --> 00:42:02,168
Yes. This and this.

528
00:42:03,043 --> 00:42:04,710
But I won't give it to you.
- Why?!

529
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,626
No.
- I love balloons. - No, no, no, no.

530
00:42:06,626 --> 00:42:08,376
In fact, Sam loves balloons.
- No.

531
00:42:08,376 --> 00:42:11,043
Whenever he sees them, he
wants to set them free in the sky.

532
00:42:11,043 --> 00:42:14,960
Red, blue, pink, green …
these colours look good on you.

533
00:42:15,376 --> 00:42:19,251
Yellow, yellow, dirty fellow.

534
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:20,418
Okay.
- Okay.

535
00:42:20,418 --> 00:42:21,835
Sorry.
- Sorry.

536
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:25,168
Can we go now?
- Okay. - It's cold.

537
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,460
Okay?
- Okay.

538
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,001
Let's go.

539
00:42:29,418 --> 00:42:33,293
Look. I'm sorry I was angry.

540
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:37,293
Your words reminded me of
all that I wanted to forget.

541
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:39,918
He really was a …

542
00:42:40,376 --> 00:42:42,543
… beast. Slimy. Idiot.
- Yeah.

543
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:44,626
Slimy. Idiot and all that.

544
00:42:44,626 --> 00:42:46,668
So, you don't love him?

545
00:42:46,918 --> 00:42:49,126
No. No, no. Of course not.

546
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:54,168
Not that, but I feel bad that
Sam will never know his father.

547
00:42:54,168 --> 00:42:55,835
If you don't love him, marry me.

548
00:42:55,835 --> 00:42:57,710
Oh, God. Stop it please.
- Marry me.

549
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,251
Marriage is not a joke.

550
00:42:59,251 --> 00:43:00,793
You know. You don't even know me.

551
00:43:00,793 --> 00:43:02,168
I know you well.

552
00:43:02,168 --> 00:43:04,001
You give fruit to
Roger the homeless.

553
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:06,210
You cut hair. You do
good deeds. You are good.

554
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,710
You're okay. - Knowing
just that is not good enough.

555
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,210
Yes. Yes. It's
enough for me. Marry me.

556
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,126
It's … - Marry me. - Oh,
God. I want to kill myself.

557
00:43:12,126 --> 00:43:14,085
Marry me. - I'm fed up … - Oh, no,
no, no, no, no. Don't kill yourself.

558
00:43:14,085 --> 00:43:15,460
Oh, no, don't kill yourself.

559
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,960
Don't die. Please, don't die.
- I'm joking.

560
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,001
Please don't die.
- I was joking. - Please don't die.

561
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:21,626
Relax, I'm joking.
- Please don't die.

562
00:43:21,626 --> 00:43:23,001
I don't understand …

563
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:24,335
Mandira. Mandira.
- I was joking …

564
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,793
Cable car. 1873.

565
00:43:25,793 --> 00:43:29,626
The first cable car was
started in San Francisco in 1873.

566
00:43:30,126 --> 00:43:34,418
1873. - You know you're ridiculous.
You're just ridiculous.

567
00:43:34,668 --> 00:43:37,418
I mean … Either you are stuck in
the 'marry me, marry me' loop …

568
00:43:37,418 --> 00:43:40,168
… or you keep recounting
the history of San Francisco.

569
00:43:40,543 --> 00:43:42,251
I don't want to know. Okay?

570
00:43:42,251 --> 00:43:44,001
I know everything about this city.

571
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:45,668
Liar. Liar.

572
00:43:45,668 --> 00:43:48,001
It's impossible to know
everything about a city.

573
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:50,126
I've tried.
- Really? - Liar. Liar.

574
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:51,501
Are you challenging me?
- Bum on fire.

575
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:52,793
Liar. Liar. - Are you
challenging me? - Bum on fire.

576
00:43:52,793 --> 00:43:54,251
Okay. You're on.
- I'm on.

577
00:43:54,251 --> 00:43:55,418
You're on.
- Liar. Liar …

578
00:43:55,418 --> 00:43:59,335
If you can show me one
place or thing in this city …

579
00:43:59,335 --> 00:44:02,668
… that I haven't seen before then …
- You'll marry me.

580
00:44:03,751 --> 00:44:06,168
You'll marry me.
- Whatever.

581
00:44:06,168 --> 00:44:07,335
Whatever.
- Okay. Okay.

582
00:44:07,335 --> 00:44:09,418
You'll marry me.
- But till then …

583
00:44:09,418 --> 00:44:10,918
… you will shut your encyclopedia.
- Okay.

584
00:44:10,918 --> 00:44:12,126
And no 'marry me, marry me'.
- Okay.

585
00:44:12,126 --> 00:44:13,710
Okay.
- Okay. Whatever.

586
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:15,293
You'll marry me.

587
00:44:16,043 --> 00:44:20,585
And you're right … the first cable
car came to San Francisco in 1873.

588
00:44:20,585 --> 00:44:21,751
Yeah.

589
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,376
And in the same year, the
first tram was started in Kolkata.

590
00:44:25,376 --> 00:44:27,876
Did you know that?
- No. You're smart.

591
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:29,085
That I am.

592
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:31,793
And pretty.
- That too.

593
00:44:31,793 --> 00:44:34,126
I'm pretty smart too.

594
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,210
Mom. Come on.

595
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,585
Coming. One minute, Sam.

596
00:44:37,793 --> 00:44:39,293
I'll just come back, okay?
- Okay.

597
00:44:39,293 --> 00:44:40,460
Yeah. Let me handle it.

598
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,876
Mrs. V, you are looking beautiful.
- You are the best.

599
00:44:43,043 --> 00:44:45,710
But you make me come
too far for my hair.

600
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:49,210
Please accept my offer
and move to Banville.

601
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:51,668
You are very generous,
Mrs. V, but I …

602
00:44:51,668 --> 00:44:53,960
Shh about that. Sara, you tell her.

603
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,460
You should move, Mandira.

604
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,543
We'll be neighbours. It will be fun.

605
00:44:57,543 --> 00:44:59,960
Mrs. V, I just don't know …
- Mom, come on.

606
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,210
Okay. I am just coming back.

607
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:03,251
Give me a minute. Sam …
- Don't worry, Granny. She'll move.

608
00:45:03,251 --> 00:45:05,001
God, he's driving me crazy.
- Mom!

609
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:06,626
Yes. Yes. What is it?
- Mom. Come on.

610
00:45:06,626 --> 00:45:08,751
Where?
- You forgot?

611
00:45:08,751 --> 00:45:10,543
Discovery museum.

612
00:45:10,543 --> 00:45:12,626
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Sam, I forgot.

613
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,335
Not fair.
- I remember. - You always forget.

614
00:45:14,335 --> 00:45:15,626
Mandira. Mandira, I have
made a list of places …

615
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:17,001
All my friends have been there!

616
00:45:17,001 --> 00:45:19,043
… which you may not have seen …
- Even I want to go. Let's go now!

617
00:45:19,043 --> 00:45:20,501
No, I don't care.
- Just … Just …

618
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:21,960
… then we can do what you have
asked me not to speak about.

619
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,085
Let's go now! Now! Now!

620
00:45:23,085 --> 00:45:24,251
Sam, Just … - It's close by. -
It's just 22 minutes away from here.

621
00:45:24,251 --> 00:45:26,501
We can take a cable car …
- Just … Just … Just shut up.

622
00:45:26,876 --> 00:45:29,001
One minute. Just
give me a minute, okay?

623
00:45:29,001 --> 00:45:30,126
This list can wait.

624
00:45:30,126 --> 00:45:31,668
First, you have to
do something for me.

625
00:45:31,668 --> 00:45:33,376
Will you take Sam
to Discovery museum?

626
00:45:33,376 --> 00:45:34,751
No.
- Please.

627
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:36,460
No, please.
- I'll kill myself.

628
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,126
Oh, no, no, no, no.
- I'll kill myself.

629
00:45:38,126 --> 00:45:39,543
No, no, no, no. Please
don't kill yourself.

630
00:45:39,543 --> 00:45:40,793
No, please don't kill yourself.
- I'll …

631
00:45:40,793 --> 00:45:41,960
Okay.
- How cute.

632
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,251
Okay. Okay.

633
00:45:43,251 --> 00:45:45,001
Okay, I'll take him.

634
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:46,835
Let's go, Sam.

635
00:45:46,835 --> 00:45:48,960
Let's go, Sam.
- Okay.

636
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,751
Look after him and
don't let go of the hand.

637
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:52,626
Okay?
- Okay.

638
00:45:53,085 --> 00:45:56,126
Not mine. His hand.

639
00:45:56,876 --> 00:45:59,001
Please, please, don't kill yourself.

640
00:45:59,001 --> 00:46:01,626
Sam, where's your hand?

641
00:46:02,668 --> 00:46:04,085
What are you doing?

642
00:46:04,085 --> 00:46:06,210
Mom said not to let go of your hand.

643
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:07,835
Mom is mad!

644
00:46:07,835 --> 00:46:09,001
No touching, okay?

645
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:10,126
No touching?
- Get it?

646
00:46:10,126 --> 00:46:12,543
Okay. Okay. No touching.

647
00:46:12,543 --> 00:46:13,793
I like that. No touching.

648
00:46:13,793 --> 00:46:15,210
Okay, everybody knows how to play.

649
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,626
We have Team A. Hello. Welcome.

650
00:46:17,626 --> 00:46:19,793
And Team B. Good luck.

651
00:46:19,793 --> 00:46:22,793
But now we need one
more team. We need Team C.

652
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:25,001
Now who's going to be Team C?

653
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:26,210
What game is this?

654
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,251
Can't you see? It's a puzzle.

655
00:46:28,251 --> 00:46:30,501
This grid has names of
animals hidden in it.

656
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:36,210
The team that identifies the maximum
number of animals wins a prize.

657
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,585
Team C, anybody?

658
00:46:37,585 --> 00:46:40,710
Last time Mom and I played, we lost.

659
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,126
Stupid game.

660
00:46:42,126 --> 00:46:45,126
Who's brave enough to
try to win the prize?

661
00:47:03,001 --> 00:47:04,210
Mom is mad!

662
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:07,793
Who wants to volunteer to be
Team C and win this fabulous prize?

663
00:47:08,293 --> 00:47:10,793
Oh terrific. We have a volunteer.

664
00:47:10,793 --> 00:47:13,876
Okay, just step forward and
we'll get started with the game.

665
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:16,835
What are you doing? No, no, no,
it's embarrassing. - No touching.

666
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:19,293
Please! We'll lose.
- No touching. - No …

667
00:47:19,293 --> 00:47:24,960
All right, on three.
One, two, three.

668
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,335
Flamingo, Chimpanzee,
Tarantulas, Stork, Penguin …

669
00:47:27,335 --> 00:47:30,460
… Walrus, Wild Boar,
Giraffe, Whale, Polar Bear …

670
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,293
… Antelope, Cormorant,
Orang-utan, Gazelle, Pelican …

671
00:47:34,293 --> 00:47:37,960
… Hippopotamus,
Porcupine, Swan, Fox.

672
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,335
And … monkey.

673
00:47:45,126 --> 00:47:46,668
Monkey.

674
00:47:49,501 --> 00:47:52,126
I guess we have a winner. Team C.

675
00:47:53,168 --> 00:47:55,543
Come on, come here
and take your prize.

676
00:47:55,835 --> 00:47:57,585
There you go. Congratulations.

677
00:47:57,585 --> 00:47:59,335
Let's hear it for Team C.

678
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:03,793
Mom! Mom! We won.

679
00:48:04,543 --> 00:48:07,293
Oh wow. Hugging, my son?
That's special.

680
00:48:07,293 --> 00:48:08,460
What did you win?

681
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,918
Here! We won because of Khan.

682
00:48:10,918 --> 00:48:14,543
Oh no, no, no, no. My
name is not Khan, its Khan.

683
00:48:14,543 --> 00:48:16,585
That's what I said … Khan.

684
00:48:16,585 --> 00:48:21,126
No, not Khan. From the epiglottis,
Khan. Khan.

685
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:27,668
From the epiglottis.
Epiglottis. Khan.

686
00:48:27,668 --> 00:48:29,043
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Time out. Time out.

687
00:48:29,043 --> 00:48:30,418
Time out.
- Khan.

688
00:48:30,418 --> 00:48:32,335
Okay? Okay?
- Khan.

689
00:48:32,585 --> 00:48:36,501
Is there any other place
you want to show me, Khan?

690
00:48:36,501 --> 00:48:37,626
Yeah.

691
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,168
Been here.

692
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:46,293
Seen this.

693
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:48,585
Bowed here.

694
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:50,960
Fell in there.
- I know.

695
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,126
Then why are we here?

696
00:48:52,126 --> 00:48:53,710
Sam wanted to feed the ducks.

697
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:56,126
Oh, yeah Khan, Khan come
on let's go feed the ducks.

698
00:48:56,126 --> 00:48:59,001
Come on! You want to hold my hands.
- Okay.

699
00:49:10,876 --> 00:49:12,501
You know, Khan.
- I don't know.

700
00:49:12,501 --> 00:49:15,835
I was 22 when I divorced.

701
00:49:15,835 --> 00:49:18,626
I was only 22 years old.
- 22.

702
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:20,335
I had nothing.

703
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:22,626
No money.

704
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:25,043
No parental support.

705
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,168
I didn't even have a house.

706
00:49:28,168 --> 00:49:29,418
Okay.

707
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:32,043
I had only Sam with me.

708
00:49:33,793 --> 00:49:36,168
I didn't know what the
future had in store.

709
00:49:37,543 --> 00:49:40,335
One day, as I was thinking,
I started walking.

710
00:49:41,168 --> 00:49:45,251
I walked a lot and
stopped after reaching here.

711
00:49:49,043 --> 00:49:50,460
There was no way ahead.

712
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,251
Yeah, only water.

713
00:49:52,251 --> 00:49:54,418
So, I turned back.

714
00:49:56,335 --> 00:49:58,543
Saw the entire city in front of me.

715
00:50:00,335 --> 00:50:04,626
And for a minute, I felt
it was waiting for me.

716
00:50:05,918 --> 00:50:07,585
I decided then …

717
00:50:08,543 --> 00:50:12,668
No, I'm going to make this work.

718
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:14,918
And I'm going to win.

719
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,668
We shall overcome.

720
00:50:16,668 --> 00:50:17,876
We shall overcome?

721
00:50:17,876 --> 00:50:20,126
Yes! We shall overcome.

722
00:50:20,126 --> 00:50:21,793
It's my favourite song.

723
00:50:21,793 --> 00:50:26,585
We shall overcome.
We shall overcome.

724
00:50:26,585 --> 00:50:30,960
We shall overcome. One day.

725
00:50:31,168 --> 00:50:40,418
The heart believes in it.
That we shall overcome one day.

726
00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:42,168
Oh, no, no, no, no.

727
00:50:42,168 --> 00:50:43,835
You sing badly.

728
00:50:43,835 --> 00:50:45,460
You suck. You suck.
- What?!

729
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,335
What?! As if you are any better!

730
00:50:49,001 --> 00:50:50,710
You suck.

731
00:50:59,251 --> 00:51:00,793
You are staring at me.

732
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:02,043
You are staring.

733
00:51:02,335 --> 00:51:04,043
You are staring.
- Okay.

734
00:51:04,043 --> 00:51:05,460
Okay.

735
00:51:06,543 --> 00:51:09,418
Sam and I are moving
to Banville next month.

736
00:51:09,751 --> 00:51:11,001
Banville.

737
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:14,043
I'm opening my own salon there.

738
00:51:14,043 --> 00:51:15,210
Banvile, California.

739
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:17,835
Population 30,000.
- Yes.

740
00:51:17,835 --> 00:51:19,960
Take me with you, Mandira.

741
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:22,168
I'm thin, I won't need much space.

742
00:51:22,168 --> 00:51:24,460
I'll keep an eye on Sam.
I'll never let go of his hand.

743
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,501
Dishwasher, microwave,
washing machine, refrigerator …

744
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,710
… I'll repair everything.

745
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,418
Dishwasher, microwave oven,
washing machine …

746
00:51:31,418 --> 00:51:32,626
… refrigerator I'll
repair everything.

747
00:51:32,626 --> 00:51:33,751
Please take me with you.
- Khan. - No, no.

748
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:34,960
Please take me with you.
- Khan, we are getting late.

749
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,543
Khan, we are getting late.
We have to go.

750
00:51:36,543 --> 00:51:37,751
Please take me with you.

751
00:51:37,751 --> 00:51:39,293
Khan, we are getting late.
- No, no please take me with you

752
00:51:39,293 --> 00:51:42,168
We have to go.
- Okay, okay

753
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,460
And by the way, I
have been here before.

754
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,043
Okay.

755
00:51:49,543 --> 00:51:51,376
Come on.
- Okay.

756
00:51:52,085 --> 00:51:55,418
Many things frighten me, Mandira.

757
00:51:55,751 --> 00:52:00,210
But nothing frightens me more
than the thought of losing you.

758
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:15,293
I was scared then
and I'm scared now.

759
00:52:27,793 --> 00:52:29,876
We're full, partner, no room.

760
00:52:30,126 --> 00:52:33,085
Okay … is there any
other motel nearby?

761
00:52:33,376 --> 00:52:36,168
Oh, you are an Indian.
I'll make some adjustments.

762
00:52:36,168 --> 00:52:39,251
You know, it's a Saturday.

763
00:52:39,543 --> 00:52:42,585
So, all the honeymoon
couples have booked my rooms.

764
00:52:42,585 --> 00:52:43,835
Saturday?

765
00:52:43,835 --> 00:52:46,210
Why? Do they marry
only on Saturdays here?

766
00:52:46,501 --> 00:52:51,626
The one-night marriages …
try and understand.

767
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:54,168
But you don't worry.
You can stay in my room.

768
00:52:54,168 --> 00:52:56,001
It has a nude channel too!

769
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:57,543
Nude channel?

770
00:52:57,543 --> 00:53:00,335
The naughty and noisy channel.

771
00:53:00,335 --> 00:53:02,543
Naughty? Noisy?

772
00:53:03,585 --> 00:53:05,085
Down. Down!

773
00:53:05,085 --> 00:53:08,293
You fool. You idiot!

774
00:53:08,293 --> 00:53:10,960
I'll burn that fair
skin of yours, you idiot!

775
00:53:12,293 --> 00:53:14,335
Rascal! Rascal!

776
00:53:14,543 --> 00:53:17,043
All this is because
of the lousy Muslims.

777
00:53:17,043 --> 00:53:19,376
Six years ago, they blew
up the World Trade Centre …

778
00:53:19,376 --> 00:53:21,126
… and today, we
bear the brunt of it.

779
00:53:21,126 --> 00:53:24,460
They call for jihad (holy war) and
we have to suffer the consequences.

780
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:28,293
And these white folk?
All blind donkeys!

781
00:53:28,293 --> 00:53:30,835
Can't you make out the difference
between a Gandhian Indian …

782
00:53:30,835 --> 00:53:34,376
… and a violent Muslim?

783
00:53:34,376 --> 00:53:35,876
Should I show you?!

784
00:53:36,126 --> 00:53:39,710
I'm going to put a board
out here: No Muslims Allowed!

785
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,168
This is the fourth
glass broken by the rogues!

786
00:53:42,501 --> 00:53:47,418
Don't worry, Brother. Come here.
It's dangerous out there.

787
00:53:47,751 --> 00:53:51,168
Listen … come back!
What's your name?

788
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:55,585
My name is Khan, and
I'm not a terrorist.

789
00:54:02,376 --> 00:54:03,960
Thank you.

790
00:54:09,543 --> 00:54:11,710
I miss you Mandira.

791
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:16,210
I know I can't return
before meeting the President.

792
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:20,751
I couldn't meet him in Washington,
so, now I'm going to Santa Fe.

793
00:54:21,126 --> 00:54:23,876
One can achieve
everything by trying, Mandira.

794
00:54:24,668 --> 00:54:28,210
Like I found that place. That day.

795
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,876
Yes, I'm coming, coming.

796
00:54:36,793 --> 00:54:38,126
Khan, thank God.

797
00:54:38,126 --> 00:54:39,293
Where were you all these days?

798
00:54:39,293 --> 00:54:40,460
I was so worried about you.

799
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,751
You could have called.

800
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:43,376
But no, you won't.

801
00:54:43,376 --> 00:54:45,793
Cell phones are bad for bees.
- Now.

802
00:54:45,793 --> 00:54:47,543
What? But wait.

803
00:54:47,543 --> 00:54:49,793
Tell me where we are going?

804
00:54:49,793 --> 00:54:52,626
I am not dressed properly.
I don't even have my shoes.

805
00:55:03,876 --> 00:55:06,501
Here. It's close.

806
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,251
Where?

807
00:55:20,043 --> 00:55:23,585
What do you mean one minute?
- One minute.

808
00:55:23,585 --> 00:55:26,001
Keep quiet, Mandira. Quiet.
- Okay.

809
00:55:26,001 --> 00:55:28,001
Quiet, Mandira. Quiet, quiet.
- Okay.

810
00:55:28,001 --> 00:55:29,960
Quiet.
- Okay.

811
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,418
I have been timing it for six days.

812
00:55:32,668 --> 00:55:34,001
One minute. Close your eyes.

813
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:35,418
Close your eyes.
- Okay.

814
00:55:35,418 --> 00:55:36,585
Now, now, now, now.
- Okay.

815
00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:39,043
Close your eyes. Okay.

816
00:55:39,043 --> 00:55:42,501
Okay, okay, okay, okay

817
00:55:50,168 --> 00:55:51,835
Now, open your eyes.

818
00:55:51,835 --> 00:55:53,001
Open your eyes.

819
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:55,126
Open now. Now, now.

820
00:55:55,126 --> 00:55:56,960
Now, please.

821
00:56:14,793 --> 00:56:18,376
Have you seen this before?

822
00:56:26,335 --> 00:56:27,960
No.

823
00:56:34,376 --> 00:56:36,001
Khan.
- Okay.

824
00:56:37,501 --> 00:56:39,210
Marry me.

825
00:56:48,043 --> 00:56:49,585
Marry me.

826
00:56:52,126 --> 00:56:55,751
Okay.
- Marry me.

827
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:03,543
You cannot marry her.
It's blasphemy!

828
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:07,293
And if you do, I will
sever all ties with you.

829
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:10,001
You will have no place in my house.

830
00:57:11,585 --> 00:57:13,335
She is a Hindu.

831
00:57:13,335 --> 00:57:16,001
There's a lot of difference
between them and us, understood?

832
00:57:19,793 --> 00:57:22,543
No. There's no difference.

833
00:57:23,251 --> 00:57:27,251
Good people … bad people.
There's no other difference.

834
00:57:38,751 --> 00:57:40,085
Mandira.

835
00:57:41,168 --> 00:57:42,835
Welcome.

836
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:46,835
So, after your marriage,
will my name be Sameer Khan?

837
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:51,085
It will be Sameer Khan,
from the epiglottis.

838
00:57:51,085 --> 00:57:55,210
Khan.
- Yeah.

839
01:00:27,835 --> 01:00:30,293
We can't do this without touching.

840
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,668
I know.
- You know.

841
01:00:31,668 --> 01:00:32,876
Yeah.

842
01:00:32,876 --> 01:00:36,001
I have read it in this book.

843
01:00:36,001 --> 01:00:40,126
Intercourse for dumbos,
by Dr. Richard k. Woomer.

844
01:00:40,668 --> 01:00:42,960
Okay.
- Nice pictures.

845
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:50,460
I think we should do it.

846
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:54,085
Now, now we should do it now.

847
01:00:54,793 --> 01:00:57,210
One minute, and …
- Oh, no, no not one minute.

848
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:58,626
Yeah.

849
01:00:58,626 --> 01:01:00,543
It will take longer than one minute.

850
01:01:43,418 --> 01:01:45,001
Bye, Khan.
- Bye, Sam.

851
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:47,918
Lunch. Lunch. Lunch. Lunch. Lunch.
- Quick, quick.

852
01:01:47,918 --> 01:01:49,210
Bye, Joe.

853
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:51,626
Bye! The apple of my eye!

854
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:14,251
And your hair looks
very pretty, ma'am.

855
01:02:14,251 --> 01:02:17,168
Thank you, sweetheart.
- You're welcome, sweetheart.

856
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:19,710
Were you flirting with her?

857
01:02:21,418 --> 01:02:24,918
You're not a liar.
- Okay.

858
01:02:24,918 --> 01:02:27,335
Reese, I've to do my homework.
Let me go home.

859
01:02:27,335 --> 01:02:29,085
Just 10 minutes, okay.
- Only 10 minutes.

860
01:02:29,085 --> 01:02:30,251
Alright.

861
01:02:30,543 --> 01:02:32,960
Surprise.

862
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,001
Thank you, Daddy.

863
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:41,210
Daddy? What about me?

864
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:45,668
Happy birthday to you.

865
01:02:48,085 --> 01:02:53,585
Mandira. Mandira, can we
have sex please. - Now?

866
01:02:54,376 --> 01:02:56,293
Now, now is good.

867
01:03:11,626 --> 01:03:16,251
With Allah's blessings, I
fulfilled my promise to Ammi.

868
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:20,335
I made a happy life for myself.

869
01:03:34,168 --> 01:03:35,335
Hello.

870
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:38,710
Yes, Sarah.

871
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:42,168
What?

872
01:03:43,585 --> 01:03:45,418
Khan, switch on the TV, please.

873
01:03:45,418 --> 01:03:47,501
Yes, Sarah let me
call you back, okay.

874
01:03:49,043 --> 01:03:51,585
I've never seen
anything like this before …

875
01:03:51,585 --> 01:03:54,210
Oh, my God!

876
01:03:55,168 --> 01:03:59,543
A second plane … a second
plane just hit the other tower.

877
01:04:00,543 --> 01:04:04,585
The skyline of Manhattan
has been changed forever.

878
01:04:04,585 --> 01:04:07,418
New York's twin towers are gone.

879
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,626
Both towers have been hit.

880
01:04:14,626 --> 01:04:18,960
It must've been a
coordinated attack …

881
01:04:50,126 --> 01:04:53,793
Mom, why are Reese and Mrs.
Garrick taking money from everyone?

882
01:04:53,793 --> 01:04:55,085
Donations, baby.

883
01:04:55,085 --> 01:05:00,001
For the family of the fire-fighters
who died saving people during 9/11.

884
01:05:00,835 --> 01:05:02,876
Hi.
- Hi.

885
01:05:02,876 --> 01:05:04,835
How is it going?
- Good, good.

886
01:05:04,835 --> 01:05:06,876
The Johnson's just
gave a thousand dollars.

887
01:05:06,876 --> 01:05:08,210
Wow.

888
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:09,376
Thank you.

889
01:05:09,376 --> 01:05:10,543
Oh, God.
- Here.

890
01:05:10,543 --> 01:05:12,418
3500 dollars.

891
01:05:12,793 --> 01:05:14,126
It's annual Zakat
(religious tax) money.

892
01:05:14,126 --> 01:05:17,043
It's a duty in Islam.
Duty, duty, duty.

893
01:05:17,043 --> 01:05:19,501
In Islam they donate a
certain percentage of their …

894
01:05:19,501 --> 01:05:21,460
… income each year in charity.
- Yes.

895
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,043
This year, how could
it be anything else?

896
01:05:23,043 --> 01:05:29,168
Yes, that's $3502
and 50 cents exactly.

897
01:06:25,251 --> 01:06:31,960
In the western world, history
is marked simply by BC and AD.

898
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:36,960
But now, there is a
third distinction. 9/11.

899
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,876
Reports are in from
various parts of America that …

900
01:06:42,876 --> 01:06:49,043
… Muslims are being
targeted and attacked.

901
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:52,168
Back off.

902
01:06:53,126 --> 01:06:54,501
Get away.

903
01:06:57,126 --> 01:06:59,126
A Sikh employee in Michigan
was shot dead by his employer …

904
01:06:59,126 --> 01:07:00,793
… because he was
mistaken for an Afghani.

905
01:07:00,793 --> 01:07:04,626
In the wake of 9/11, a lot of
American Muslims are changing …

906
01:07:04,626 --> 01:07:07,001
… their names to
escape racial profiling.

907
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:09,585
Questions are being raised
about America's biased views …

908
01:07:09,585 --> 01:07:12,251
… towards the Islamic community.

909
01:07:12,251 --> 01:07:16,043
Even as Muslim women wearing
hijabs (veils) are being targeted.

910
01:07:16,043 --> 01:07:18,710
Post 9/11, America's view
towards its Islamic inhabitants …

911
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:20,585
… is changing rapidly.

912
01:07:27,876 --> 01:07:29,626
They must be getting late.

913
01:07:29,626 --> 01:07:31,293
Let's mom drop you today.

914
01:07:31,543 --> 01:07:33,293
And we'll grab an
ice-cream on the way. - Yeah.

915
01:07:33,293 --> 01:07:34,418
Come on.

916
01:07:35,126 --> 01:07:37,043
Of all the religions in the world …

917
01:07:37,043 --> 01:07:39,668
… Islam is the most
violent and aggressive.

918
01:07:39,876 --> 01:07:44,668
It encourages killing or 'Jihad'
as they call it, in the name of God.

919
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:10,376
Sam, you need to tell your
mom about this. - No, Reese.

920
01:08:10,793 --> 01:08:13,293
I think she already has
too much to worry about.

921
01:08:36,418 --> 01:08:38,126
Get out of my country.

922
01:08:55,626 --> 01:08:59,543
Don't wear this now.

923
01:09:06,418 --> 01:09:10,335
Allah will understand.
These people won't.

924
01:09:13,793 --> 01:09:15,251
Never.

925
01:09:22,001 --> 01:09:23,085
Yes?

926
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:27,710
I'm Mandira. I heard
about Hasina, so …

927
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:33,585
She is upstairs,
bhabi (sister-in-law).

928
01:09:40,626 --> 01:09:42,418
He won't come in.

929
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:07,460
Bhai, please come in. Please.

930
01:10:26,168 --> 01:10:28,751
You are my good son, aren't you?

931
01:10:31,210 --> 01:10:33,251
You are my good son, aren't you?

932
01:10:36,168 --> 01:10:39,751
Alright, Mandira,
you'll join us on Monday.

933
01:10:41,251 --> 01:10:43,168
Thank you so much.

934
01:10:43,626 --> 01:10:45,876
I just want to clarify one thing.

935
01:10:46,585 --> 01:10:49,876
My last name is Khan,
my husband is Muslim.

936
01:10:51,626 --> 01:10:56,210
We'll see you on Monday.
- Thanks.

937
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:04,251
Khan. I got the job, I got the job.
- Okay.

938
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:05,460
I got the job.
- Okay.

939
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:06,626
Now, everything will be all right.

940
01:11:06,626 --> 01:11:07,960
We'll do it. We'll do it.
- I know.

941
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,085
We'll do it.
- We'll do it.

942
01:11:09,085 --> 01:11:10,710
Yes, yes, yes.
- We shall overcome?

943
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:12,626
We shall overcome?

944
01:11:12,626 --> 01:11:17,210
We shall overcome.
We shall overcome.

945
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,543
You suck.

946
01:11:18,543 --> 01:11:20,876
You suck. Please don't sing.

947
01:11:22,793 --> 01:11:28,501
We shall overcome. I know,
Mandira, we will …

948
01:11:30,293 --> 01:11:35,960
I'm in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
to meet the President.

949
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:42,335
His motorcade has 12 cars …

950
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:48,126
… but no one tells me
which car the President is in.

951
01:12:00,668 --> 01:12:06,960
Mandira, I don't know why, but I
keep failing to meet the President.

952
01:12:07,168 --> 01:12:09,668
But I know I have to meet him.

953
01:12:09,918 --> 01:12:12,751
I have to tell him about Sam.

954
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,043
Sam. Khan.

955
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:21,001
So there you guys are.

956
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:22,501
So, how was your day?

957
01:12:23,085 --> 01:12:24,376
Again Xbox?

958
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:27,585
Make place for me,
make place for me.

959
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,210
Don't hug me mom.
- Come here, sweety.

960
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:31,626
Don't hug me.

961
01:12:31,626 --> 01:12:35,543
And how are you sweetheart? - No,
no don't hug me, don't hug me, no.

962
01:12:40,168 --> 01:12:42,251
Phone.
- I know.

963
01:12:42,251 --> 01:12:44,168
But I'll be back.
- Why?

964
01:12:44,168 --> 01:12:46,293
Because you've no choice.

965
01:12:48,543 --> 01:12:51,126
Hello. Hey Sarah.

966
01:12:52,876 --> 01:12:56,543
Mark's being sent to cover
the war, in Afghanistan.

967
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:02,626
Reese, pass Mrs. Khan the salad.

968
01:13:03,751 --> 01:13:06,001
Sam, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

969
01:13:06,001 --> 01:13:08,043
Sarah, we are fine.

970
01:13:11,501 --> 01:13:12,960
I'm fine.

971
01:13:15,835 --> 01:13:18,001
Rizvan, how is the chicken?
Do you like it?

972
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:20,501
No, not at all.

973
01:13:23,793 --> 01:13:26,543
Did I … did I say a joke?

974
01:13:26,876 --> 01:13:28,460
Yes you did, Rizvan.

975
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:31,960
And a very good one indeed.
- Thank you Mark.

976
01:13:32,251 --> 01:13:34,210
But the chicken is not good.

977
01:13:34,793 --> 01:13:38,251
It's a new recipe. I …
- Don't make it ever again.

978
01:13:40,543 --> 01:13:44,543
Mark was going to cover the
war in Afghanistan, Mandira.

979
01:13:45,585 --> 01:13:47,293
Ammi was right.

980
01:13:47,293 --> 01:13:49,543
Families are not just made by blood.

981
01:13:49,543 --> 01:13:51,376
They are made with love too.

982
01:13:51,376 --> 01:13:56,085
Sarah, Mark and Reese had
become a part of our world.

983
01:13:56,293 --> 01:14:00,293
But I never told them that …

984
01:14:00,918 --> 01:14:02,835
I should have told them.

985
01:14:28,168 --> 01:14:29,751
Take care, buddy.

986
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:34,751
See you, Reese.
- Take care, Reese.

987
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,543
Hey, Reese.

988
01:14:56,793 --> 01:15:01,876
In chapter five, verse 32 of the
Quran, Allah has decreed that …

989
01:15:02,126 --> 01:15:09,376
… the death of one innocent is
equal to the death of humanity.

990
01:15:20,043 --> 01:15:27,043
I knew that the death of
innocents in 9/11 …

991
01:15:27,043 --> 01:15:29,168
… would cost the entire humanity.

992
01:15:29,585 --> 01:15:34,460
But I did not know that
you and I would have to pay …

993
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:36,960
… the biggest price, Mandira.

994
01:15:37,293 --> 01:15:41,668
Why did this happen
to us, Mandira? Why?

995
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:54,210
Reese. Just talk to me man.

996
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:57,001
Wait a minute. Why are
you ignoring me, Reese?

997
01:15:57,001 --> 01:15:58,418
Its been so many days since …

998
01:15:58,418 --> 01:16:00,751
Reese, listen to me. Wait a minute.

999
01:16:01,626 --> 01:16:03,585
Please listen to me man.

1000
01:16:03,918 --> 01:16:06,043
What's the problem?
What have I done?

1001
01:16:06,293 --> 01:16:08,168
Reese, just listen to me.
- Piss off.

1002
01:16:08,168 --> 01:16:09,585
Listen to me.

1003
01:16:16,376 --> 01:16:19,001
Hello. I have got new shoes for you.

1004
01:16:19,001 --> 01:16:21,585
Pele Shoe Stores, 34/99. Try them.

1005
01:16:21,585 --> 01:16:24,626
Not now.
- Return policy, only fourteen days.

1006
01:16:24,626 --> 01:16:25,793
Try now.
- Not now.

1007
01:16:25,793 --> 01:16:27,335
No, no try now, try now.

1008
01:16:27,335 --> 01:16:29,751
I said not now.
- Okay.

1009
01:16:31,835 --> 01:16:33,001
Okay.

1010
01:16:35,376 --> 01:16:37,543
Return policy, only
fourteen days. Okay.

1011
01:16:42,418 --> 01:16:43,835
Hey.

1012
01:16:44,585 --> 01:16:48,626
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled.
- Yes, very loud.

1013
01:16:48,626 --> 01:16:51,668
Very, very loud. Not nice,
not nice. - Khan.

1014
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,793
Khan, please don't be angry with me.

1015
01:16:53,793 --> 01:16:55,668
I don't have any
friends apart from you.

1016
01:16:55,668 --> 01:16:57,626
Liar. Liar.

1017
01:16:57,835 --> 01:16:59,126
Reese is your friend.

1018
01:16:59,126 --> 01:17:00,293
He's your friend.
- Right.

1019
01:17:00,293 --> 01:17:02,585
You're a liar. He's your friend.

1020
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:04,835
Cool shoes.
- Thank you.

1021
01:17:04,835 --> 01:17:06,376
Can I try them?
- No.

1022
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:08,168
Please.
- No, please.

1023
01:17:09,085 --> 01:17:11,001
Want to play?
- No.

1024
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:12,251
I'll beat you.

1025
01:17:12,251 --> 01:17:14,543
I'll kick your butt.
- Oh, you'll kick my butt.

1026
01:17:14,543 --> 01:17:15,751
You suck.
- I suck.

1027
01:17:15,751 --> 01:17:17,210
You suck.
- No, I think you suck.

1028
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:19,001
I'll kick your butt.
- You'll kick my butt.

1029
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:20,251
Yeah.
- Here, catch.

1030
01:17:20,251 --> 01:17:21,751
Okay, here catch.

1031
01:17:21,751 --> 01:17:24,126
Thank you, bye.
- Bye.

1032
01:17:24,126 --> 01:17:25,960
Hey, Sam.

1033
01:17:26,918 --> 01:17:30,918
Liar. Liar. Bum on fire.

1034
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,001
Mom, I'm off.

1035
01:17:39,001 --> 01:17:42,001
I'm going to school.
- Good morning.

1036
01:17:42,001 --> 01:17:43,585
Mom, be quick.

1037
01:17:43,585 --> 01:17:45,501
Please mom. Mom I'm getting late.

1038
01:17:45,501 --> 01:17:49,418
Chill out mom.
- Don't try to be cool. - Why, dude?

1039
01:17:49,418 --> 01:17:51,543
Whatever. I'll be late today,
I have soccer practise.

1040
01:17:51,543 --> 01:17:53,751
Do you have to play soccer?

1041
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:55,126
Do you have to cut hair?

1042
01:17:55,126 --> 01:17:56,376
Very clever.

1043
01:17:56,376 --> 01:17:59,960
The apple of my eye!
Love me till I die!

1044
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,376
Sam. Sam.

1045
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:06,668
Why is Sam walking so strangely?

1046
01:18:08,668 --> 01:18:10,460
Why are you laughing so strangely?

1047
01:18:13,001 --> 01:18:14,668
You're too cute.
- No, no.

1048
01:18:14,668 --> 01:18:16,085
You're too cute.
- No, no, please, please.

1049
01:18:16,085 --> 01:18:17,376
Please, don't hug me.
- Khan, please.

1050
01:18:17,376 --> 01:18:19,751
No, no.
- Khan, please.

1051
01:18:19,751 --> 01:18:21,710
No, no, please.
Please, don't hug me.

1052
01:18:22,585 --> 01:18:27,293
November 27, 2007. 8:23 a.m.

1053
01:18:28,918 --> 01:18:33,460
I still remember the day … That's
the last time I heard you laugh.

1054
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:36,168
Reese. Reese.

1055
01:18:37,001 --> 01:18:38,168
Reese, you haven't
spoken in eight days now.

1056
01:18:38,168 --> 01:18:39,543
What's up?
- Just leave me alone.

1057
01:18:39,543 --> 01:18:41,585
What's with you? You
know I loved your dad.

1058
01:18:41,585 --> 01:18:43,501
Just … don't talk about my dad.

1059
01:18:43,501 --> 01:18:45,710
Come on, Reese, we're best friends.
Our moms are best friends.

1060
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:47,960
You know what you people
are nobody's best friends.

1061
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,376
All you people care is about
your damn 'Jihad' or whatever.

1062
01:18:50,376 --> 01:18:51,751
What are you talking about man?

1063
01:18:51,751 --> 01:18:53,626
Reese, just listen to me.
- Just go away.

1064
01:18:53,626 --> 01:18:55,710
No, Reese, you listen …
- Shut up, and go! - Listen.

1065
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:58,751
Sameer, I said go away.
- Listen to me man.

1066
01:18:58,751 --> 01:19:00,043
Just go away.

1067
01:19:00,043 --> 01:19:01,251
Look at those two little brats.

1068
01:19:01,251 --> 01:19:04,251
Hey, ladies, come on
time out. Come on.

1069
01:19:04,251 --> 01:19:05,710
Didn't you hear him?

1070
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:07,251
He said "Leave him alone".

1071
01:19:07,251 --> 01:19:09,043
So why don't you go
home to your mummy.

1072
01:19:09,043 --> 01:19:12,210
Stay out of it.
- What?

1073
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:13,835
I said, stay out of it.
- What did you say?

1074
01:19:13,835 --> 01:19:15,335
You heard me, stay out of it.

1075
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:18,710
Jim, let him go.
- What's the matter?

1076
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:20,376
Don't you care about your dead dad?
- Yeah, but …

1077
01:19:20,376 --> 01:19:23,043
Is Osama your lover?
- Let him go.

1078
01:19:23,043 --> 01:19:24,543
So … dead.

1079
01:19:29,168 --> 01:19:31,460
Stop it guys, you're hurting him.

1080
01:19:32,335 --> 01:19:34,043
Oh, he liked that one.

1081
01:19:37,085 --> 01:19:38,210
What did he just do.

1082
01:19:39,168 --> 01:19:40,710
Let's get him guys.

1083
01:19:47,543 --> 01:19:49,585
Hey, Osama's son.

1084
01:19:49,585 --> 01:19:51,168
Bloody Paki.

1085
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:20,001
Get away.

1086
01:20:20,793 --> 01:20:22,335
Get away.

1087
01:20:30,543 --> 01:20:34,293
Screw you assholes
- What did you say?

1088
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,168
Screw you.

1089
01:20:58,168 --> 01:21:00,960
Sameer. Come on buddy, get up.

1090
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,126
Sameer.

1091
01:21:02,126 --> 01:21:03,751
Sameer, come on.

1092
01:21:03,751 --> 01:21:06,626
Sameer. Sameer.

1093
01:21:06,626 --> 01:21:08,918
Oh, shit.
- Come on.

1094
01:21:09,543 --> 01:21:11,126
This didn't happen, okay.

1095
01:21:11,126 --> 01:21:13,585
This didn't happen
this didn't happen.

1096
01:21:13,876 --> 01:21:15,126
Or else …

1097
01:21:15,418 --> 01:21:16,876
Do you hear me?

1098
01:21:43,251 --> 01:21:45,001
Mrs. Khan. I'm detective Garcia.

1099
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:47,043
I need to ask you some
questions about this?

1100
01:21:47,043 --> 01:21:48,876
Later.
- Let's get him into the ER.

1101
01:21:48,876 --> 01:21:52,251
Is the trauma team ready?
- Yes, they are …

1102
01:21:52,251 --> 01:21:54,418
Lip discolouration …
discolouration of the face.

1103
01:21:54,418 --> 01:21:55,793
How is his pulse?
- Rapid pulse.

1104
01:21:55,793 --> 01:21:59,126
Possible internal bleeding.
Possible spleen rupture.

1105
01:21:59,126 --> 01:22:01,626
What's going on?
- We got to do this fast, you guys.

1106
01:22:01,835 --> 01:22:04,126
He's losing blood. I think
we got to give him blood.

1107
01:22:04,126 --> 01:22:05,835
We got to do this fast.

1108
01:22:06,793 --> 01:22:08,376
Spleen rupture.

1109
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:13,960
Spleen rupture. Spleen rupture.
Spleen rupture.

1110
01:22:15,585 --> 01:22:17,585
Go, go, go.

1111
01:22:17,585 --> 01:22:19,835
Ma'am, you need to stay out.

1112
01:22:23,043 --> 01:22:24,585
Okay, what've we got here,
what've we got?

1113
01:22:24,585 --> 01:22:25,960
No signs of internal bleeding.

1114
01:22:27,001 --> 01:22:28,210
Give me vitals.

1115
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:30,085
Heart is throbbing extremely low.
- Okay.

1116
01:22:30,085 --> 01:22:32,251
Okay, defib now.
- He's technicardiac.

1117
01:22:32,501 --> 01:22:34,835
Give me the defib.
- Ready for defib.

1118
01:22:34,835 --> 01:22:36,460
Okay, we're going to shock in 200.

1119
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:37,960
Ready now.

1120
01:22:38,293 --> 01:22:39,543
Clear.

1121
01:22:40,168 --> 01:22:41,585
200.

1122
01:22:41,585 --> 01:22:47,793
One, two, three … clear.
- Still no pulse.

1123
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:49,835
Okay go to 300.

1124
01:22:49,835 --> 01:22:50,918
Clear.

1125
01:22:52,376 --> 01:22:54,418
Still no pulse, doctor.

1126
01:23:01,001 --> 01:23:02,418
We lost him.

1127
01:23:02,918 --> 01:23:05,168
Time of death, 8:05 p.m.

1128
01:23:25,585 --> 01:23:26,918
Sam.

1129
01:23:32,876 --> 01:23:34,585
Ruptured spleen … spleen.

1130
01:23:34,585 --> 01:23:37,293
It's the only part
of the human body …

1131
01:23:37,293 --> 01:23:39,501
… the use of which is
not known to doctors.

1132
01:23:39,876 --> 01:23:42,085
When the capsule
containing the spleen is ruptured …

1133
01:23:42,085 --> 01:23:45,043
… a splenectomy is performed,
and the spleen is removed.

1134
01:23:45,293 --> 01:23:51,626
But that can lead to
pneumococcal infection.

1135
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:53,210
He's dead.

1136
01:23:55,585 --> 01:23:57,001
He's dead.

1137
01:24:02,418 --> 01:24:08,168
The splenic … artery is clamped.
- Time of death, 8:05 p.m.

1138
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:14,043
Time of death, 8:05 p.m.

1139
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:21,293
Time of death, 8:05 p.m.

1140
01:24:24,085 --> 01:24:27,501
Time of death, 8:05 p.m.

1141
01:25:11,126 --> 01:25:12,543
Sam.

1142
01:25:16,251 --> 01:25:18,293
Come back to me.

1143
01:25:21,043 --> 01:25:22,960
Come back to me, baby.

1144
01:25:27,251 --> 01:25:29,126
Come back to me, baby.

1145
01:25:33,668 --> 01:25:35,418
Don't leave me.

1146
01:25:37,668 --> 01:25:39,793
Don't leave me, please.

1147
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:48,960
Come back to me please.
Please come back. Please.

1148
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:58,626
Come back to me, Sam.

1149
01:25:59,585 --> 01:26:01,793
Sam, come back.

1150
01:26:03,001 --> 01:26:05,876
Don't leave me.

1151
01:26:33,001 --> 01:26:34,710
I apologise for the late hour.

1152
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:38,835
But 48 hours is our best window
to catch the attackers. - Yeah.

1153
01:26:38,835 --> 01:26:41,543
Now, I've gone through the
medical examiner's reports.

1154
01:26:41,543 --> 01:26:44,335
The attack on your son
seems very personal Mrs. Khan.

1155
01:26:44,335 --> 01:26:46,751
It happened at the
community soccer field.

1156
01:26:47,751 --> 01:26:51,793
Inspector Garcia told us
that our Sam's death …

1157
01:26:51,793 --> 01:26:54,085
… may have been a racial attack.

1158
01:26:54,085 --> 01:26:58,043
His wounds were proof of that.

1159
01:26:58,043 --> 01:27:01,210
He was a Muslim, so he was killed.

1160
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:04,335
But I couldn't understand.

1161
01:27:04,335 --> 01:27:08,918
Being a Muslim is not
a bad thing, Mandira.

1162
01:27:31,918 --> 01:27:33,668
Sam.

1163
01:27:35,001 --> 01:27:36,210
My baby.

1164
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:37,460
Mandira …

1165
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:38,918
We killed him.

1166
01:27:38,918 --> 01:27:40,168
Mandira …

1167
01:27:40,168 --> 01:27:42,085
We killed him.

1168
01:27:42,626 --> 01:27:43,960
We killed him.

1169
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,168
Mandira …

1170
01:27:45,168 --> 01:27:47,001
Let's go home.

1171
01:27:47,001 --> 01:27:49,210
We killed him.

1172
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:52,751
It's time for dinner.

1173
01:27:52,751 --> 01:27:53,918
Doctors say that post-traumatic
disorder causes people …

1174
01:27:53,918 --> 01:27:55,043
… to ignore their health.

1175
01:27:55,043 --> 01:27:58,668
Both of us killed him. - You
need to take care of your health.

1176
01:27:58,668 --> 01:28:00,585
Just shut up, just shut up.

1177
01:28:00,585 --> 01:28:01,918
Are you listening
to what I am saying?

1178
01:28:01,918 --> 01:28:04,626
We killed him!

1179
01:28:06,501 --> 01:28:10,043
It's all my fault.

1180
01:28:11,126 --> 01:28:13,668
If I hadn't married you …

1181
01:28:13,668 --> 01:28:15,460
… all this wouldn't have happened.

1182
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:21,251
I thought you loved me so much.

1183
01:28:21,585 --> 01:28:23,335
Loved Sam so much.

1184
01:28:23,335 --> 01:28:27,751
What difference would it
make if his name is changed?

1185
01:28:28,001 --> 01:28:29,585
What difference would it make …

1186
01:28:29,585 --> 01:28:31,960
… if a 'Khan' was added to his name?

1187
01:28:33,085 --> 01:28:35,001
But I was wrong.

1188
01:28:35,001 --> 01:28:36,793
It makes a difference.

1189
01:28:37,210 --> 01:28:39,168
It does make a difference.

1190
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:42,168
I should never have
married a Muslim man!

1191
01:28:42,751 --> 01:28:45,960
If Sam had been a Rathod (Hindu),
he would have been alive today.

1192
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,835
He was a Khan, so, he died.

1193
01:28:47,835 --> 01:28:51,085
He died because of you.
Because of your surname!

1194
01:28:52,335 --> 01:28:55,001
I don't understand
what you are saying.

1195
01:28:55,001 --> 01:28:58,126
I don't understand what you
are saying. You are not well.

1196
01:28:58,126 --> 01:28:59,376
God.

1197
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:02,418
I want to die.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1198
01:29:02,418 --> 01:29:03,668
I want to die.

1199
01:29:03,668 --> 01:29:05,585
No, no, no Mandira please don't die.

1200
01:29:05,835 --> 01:29:09,668
No, no, please don't die.

1201
01:29:10,085 --> 01:29:12,668
You can't die. Please don't die.

1202
01:29:12,668 --> 01:29:15,668
Just leave me alone, please.

1203
01:29:15,668 --> 01:29:17,543
Leave me please.

1204
01:29:17,543 --> 01:29:19,668
I don't even want to see you.

1205
01:29:19,668 --> 01:29:23,793
Whenever I see you I
remember Sam's wounds.

1206
01:29:25,668 --> 01:29:27,126
I can't do this.

1207
01:29:28,751 --> 01:29:30,751
I can't do this anymore.

1208
01:29:31,043 --> 01:29:32,793
I'm leaving you, Khan.

1209
01:29:32,793 --> 01:29:35,126
I'm leaving you!

1210
01:29:35,126 --> 01:29:36,710
Why should you leave?

1211
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:38,585
The house is yours. I will leave.

1212
01:29:38,585 --> 01:29:41,168
Go right now! This instant!

1213
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:43,585
Go right now.

1214
01:29:43,585 --> 01:29:47,293
Go! Go!

1215
01:29:55,543 --> 01:29:56,960
Mandira …

1216
01:30:00,251 --> 01:30:02,085
When should I come back?

1217
01:30:03,376 --> 01:30:05,210
When should you be back?

1218
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:08,835
When should you be back?

1219
01:30:09,835 --> 01:30:11,668
You know Banville?

1220
01:30:12,001 --> 01:30:14,543
It has a population of 30,000.

1221
01:30:14,543 --> 01:30:19,126
And each one of those
30,000 people hates you.

1222
01:30:19,126 --> 01:30:21,585
Tell all of them that
you are not a terrorist.

1223
01:30:21,585 --> 01:30:23,418
Why only them?

1224
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:27,710
Tell every person in America.

1225
01:30:28,626 --> 01:30:31,918
Can you do that? Can you?

1226
01:30:31,918 --> 01:30:33,418
No, you can't.

1227
01:30:33,418 --> 01:30:36,418
Why don't you tell the
President of United States then?

1228
01:30:36,835 --> 01:30:41,751
Mr. President, my name is
Khan and I'm not a terrorist.

1229
01:30:42,668 --> 01:30:44,835
So, he can tell all these people …

1230
01:30:45,085 --> 01:30:48,960
… that my Sam was not the
terrorist son of a terrorist father.

1231
01:30:49,376 --> 01:30:51,501
He was just a baby.

1232
01:30:52,876 --> 01:30:54,668
My baby.

1233
01:30:57,876 --> 01:30:59,751
When you do that …

1234
01:31:01,085 --> 01:31:02,918
… come back.

1235
01:31:04,043 --> 01:31:05,960
Come back then!

1236
01:31:14,501 --> 01:31:27,335
Mr. President, my name is
Khan and I'm not a terrorist.

1237
01:31:27,626 --> 01:31:34,793
My name is Khan and
I'm not a terrorist.

1238
01:31:34,793 --> 01:31:37,043
Not a terrorist.

1239
01:32:47,793 --> 01:32:52,626
Mandira, I felt a stab of pain
in my chest when I left you.

1240
01:32:52,626 --> 01:32:55,501
I thought it was chest congestion.

1241
01:32:55,501 --> 01:33:00,751
But no amount of ginger juice
could make the pain go away.

1242
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:02,460
It's still there.

1243
01:36:57,626 --> 01:37:01,960
Bhabhi, whatever you
said then was said in anger.

1244
01:37:02,418 --> 01:37:04,835
It was Sam's grief
that made you say it.

1245
01:37:05,293 --> 01:37:07,960
We all know you love him a lot.

1246
01:37:08,168 --> 01:37:11,585
Then why don't you … - There is no
space for love in my life right now.

1247
01:37:12,001 --> 01:37:13,918
Love will weaken me.

1248
01:37:14,418 --> 01:37:16,876
Hate will help me fight this battle.

1249
01:37:17,251 --> 01:37:19,668
And I have to fight for Sam.

1250
01:37:20,293 --> 01:37:22,960
I can't be Khan's wife right now.

1251
01:37:23,793 --> 01:37:27,251
I'm just a mother
whose son has been killed.

1252
01:37:39,335 --> 01:37:42,376
I've had a long day, and
I've sold enough tickets.

1253
01:37:42,835 --> 01:37:45,918
I'll have to call you back, alright.

1254
01:37:48,418 --> 01:37:51,751
For dinner with the
president is $500 you know.

1255
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:59,293
That's … that's 500.

1256
01:38:01,543 --> 01:38:04,835
What church are you from?
- Church? Church?

1257
01:38:05,501 --> 01:38:08,085
This is a Christian's only event.

1258
01:38:08,085 --> 01:38:12,960
But … but it says, it's a fund
raiser for the draught in Africa.

1259
01:38:13,335 --> 01:38:14,710
For Christians, honey.

1260
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,668
Honey, Honey keep it.

1261
01:38:20,168 --> 01:38:22,210
For those are not
Christian in Africa.

1262
01:38:25,293 --> 01:38:28,751
Honey. Honey, feed Africa.

1263
01:38:43,043 --> 01:38:44,751
Offer it to him as well?

1264
01:38:48,418 --> 01:38:50,876
Excuse me, would you
like to have some?

1265
01:39:35,001 --> 01:39:39,043
What's your name?
- Rizvan Khan. Khan.

1266
01:39:39,918 --> 01:39:42,835
I'm Imran and this is Sajida.

1267
01:39:44,710 --> 01:39:46,001
Where are you off to?

1268
01:39:46,001 --> 01:39:47,543
It's time for the bus to leave.

1269
01:39:47,793 --> 01:39:49,251
Prayer time.

1270
01:39:49,251 --> 01:39:51,001
Prayer time?

1271
01:39:51,001 --> 01:39:53,126
Now? Here?

1272
01:39:54,543 --> 01:39:58,710
You should pray depending upon
the place and the people around.

1273
01:40:01,251 --> 01:40:04,418
No. No, no.

1274
01:40:05,793 --> 01:40:08,251
Prayer should never depend
upon the place or the people.

1275
01:40:08,251 --> 01:40:10,501
It should depend
only on your belief.

1276
01:41:50,668 --> 01:41:52,210
My God, my knee.

1277
01:41:52,210 --> 01:41:54,335
Oh my God, my knee is bleeding.

1278
01:41:56,126 --> 01:42:00,001
I'm sorry, but I
can't repair your knee.

1279
01:42:00,293 --> 01:42:03,960
But can you at least
help me please. - Help?

1280
01:42:05,418 --> 01:42:07,835
Oh, yes I can do that.

1281
01:42:08,585 --> 01:42:10,043
Okay, thanks.

1282
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:12,585
Joel, that better be you.

1283
01:42:15,001 --> 01:42:16,543
Hello.

1284
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,918
You are an angel.

1285
01:42:18,918 --> 01:42:20,126
You've saved my baby.

1286
01:42:20,126 --> 01:42:22,293
He could've been out
there lying, bleeding.

1287
01:42:22,293 --> 01:42:23,710
Oh, thank you, thank you.

1288
01:42:23,710 --> 01:42:26,876
You little frisky thing,
aren't you? - Please don't hug me.

1289
01:42:26,876 --> 01:42:28,835
Alright.
- That's my Mama Jenny.

1290
01:42:28,835 --> 01:42:32,001
Always trying to hug everyone.
- Mama Jenny, please don't hug me.

1291
01:42:32,001 --> 01:42:38,001
Joel Izale Williams. I told
you not take that bicycle out.

1292
01:42:38,001 --> 01:42:40,751
Now off to bed with you.
- Yes, ma'am.

1293
01:42:40,751 --> 01:42:43,960
You. You Mr. Repair man.
- Rizvan.

1294
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:47,168
Rizvan. Oh, you hungry child?
You want little dinner?

1295
01:42:47,168 --> 01:42:49,335
No, I want lots of dinner.

1296
01:42:52,001 --> 01:42:54,043
First we've got to get
you out of those clothes.

1297
01:42:54,043 --> 01:42:57,376
You want me to be naked?
- No, no, no.

1298
01:42:57,376 --> 01:42:59,918
Just get this
cleaned up, that's all.

1299
01:42:59,918 --> 01:43:04,001
Funny hair Joel and his
Mama Jenny are good people.

1300
01:43:04,001 --> 01:43:06,960
Mama Jenny is strict
and a little fat too.

1301
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:09,460
But I like her.

1302
01:43:20,043 --> 01:43:22,001
Mama Jenny's elder son, James …

1303
01:43:22,001 --> 01:43:25,960
… was killed two
months ago in the Iraq war.

1304
01:43:28,918 --> 01:43:31,293
But he loved his country.

1305
01:43:33,210 --> 01:43:37,168
Mama Jenny too
asked me about Sameer.

1306
01:43:37,501 --> 01:43:40,918
Sam has been gone for 179 days …

1307
01:43:40,918 --> 01:43:45,710
… and for the first time,
someone made a mention of him to me.

1308
01:43:51,001 --> 01:43:53,460
Poor baby.

1309
01:43:54,293 --> 01:43:57,251
Poor baby.

1310
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:04,043
Mama Jenny and Funny Hair
Joel live in Wilhemina …

1311
01:44:04,043 --> 01:44:06,543
… Tarrow County, Georgia.

1312
01:44:08,251 --> 01:44:15,460
This small town has 204
people and 754 cows exactly.

1313
01:44:18,001 --> 01:44:21,543
All the people here
work at the dairy farm.

1314
01:44:21,543 --> 01:44:25,126
And pray at the Church Of Rock.

1315
01:44:29,501 --> 01:44:35,501
Today, there's a memorial service
for all the soldiers killed in Iraq.

1316
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:45,043
Mama Jenny has added Sameer's
name to the list of martyrs.

1317
01:44:47,501 --> 01:44:53,085
Mama Jenny said by
remembering and talking about them …

1318
01:44:53,085 --> 01:44:55,876
… we can get closer to them.

1319
01:44:55,876 --> 01:44:57,960
Letters just stopped.

1320
01:44:58,626 --> 01:45:02,126
My mom's never been the same,
she cries all the time.

1321
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:06,001
I loved my brother so much,
and I just want him to know …

1322
01:45:06,001 --> 01:45:08,501
… if he's out there,
that I miss him.

1323
01:45:08,876 --> 01:45:10,001
He's always …

1324
01:45:10,001 --> 01:45:16,251
I too tried to get closer to Sam.

1325
01:45:17,001 --> 01:45:20,501
Sameer Rathod Khan, my son.

1326
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:25,335
Weight 56 kilogram,
blood group O positive.

1327
01:45:25,585 --> 01:45:28,251
Sameer loved Xbox and soccer.

1328
01:45:28,251 --> 01:45:32,876
He loved his soccer shoes so
much that he would sleep in them.

1329
01:45:32,876 --> 01:45:35,585
That was the only bad habit he had.

1330
01:45:35,585 --> 01:45:38,876
Sam was six years old
when I married his mother.

1331
01:45:38,876 --> 01:45:41,168
Sameer was a good son.

1332
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:46,835
He did not mind sharing
his mom's love with me.

1333
01:45:47,168 --> 01:45:52,001
But I couldn't be
such a good dad to him.

1334
01:45:52,793 --> 01:45:58,001
Other dads sense their children's
unsaid needs and fulfil them.

1335
01:45:58,376 --> 01:46:02,376
But I can't sense
unexpressed feelings.

1336
01:46:02,376 --> 01:46:04,835
So, I couldn't fulfil them.

1337
01:46:05,585 --> 01:46:08,585
But … but, Sam never complained.

1338
01:46:08,585 --> 01:46:11,751
He never complained.

1339
01:46:13,418 --> 01:46:15,710
Sam had one more bad habit.

1340
01:46:15,710 --> 01:46:17,501
He told us only good things.

1341
01:46:17,751 --> 01:46:19,835
He always hid bad news from us.

1342
01:46:21,126 --> 01:46:23,043
He would never tell me
when my favorite …

1343
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:24,835
… team Manchester United lost.

1344
01:46:24,835 --> 01:46:26,251
Never.

1345
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:29,960
Unless we had a bet.
Then he would tell me.

1346
01:46:30,293 --> 01:46:35,835
Then I would I have to give him
his mint chocolate-chip ice cream.

1347
01:46:36,918 --> 01:46:38,751
Two scoops.

1348
01:46:39,543 --> 01:46:41,460
Two scoops, always.

1349
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:46,668
Two scoops.

1350
01:46:47,418 --> 01:46:50,376
On 27th November 2007,
he was killed.

1351
01:46:52,293 --> 01:46:55,168
He was 13 years, nine
months and four days old.

1352
01:46:56,793 --> 01:47:00,585
Sameer was not only my son,
he was my dearest friend.

1353
01:47:00,585 --> 01:47:03,793
Actually, my only friend.

1354
01:47:03,793 --> 01:47:05,293
My …

1355
01:47:05,793 --> 01:47:10,668
My … only best friend.

1356
01:47:18,751 --> 01:47:22,418
I'm sure Allah is happy that
Sam is with him in heaven.

1357
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:30,418
I … Mama Jenny, I
don't know what to say.

1358
01:47:31,501 --> 01:47:36,168
I don't want to say anymore.

1359
01:48:12,710 --> 01:48:14,585
Come on, Rizvan.

1360
01:49:53,043 --> 01:49:54,501
Okay.
- Okay.

1361
01:49:54,501 --> 01:49:56,001
Bye.

1362
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:59,335
Bye, Rizvan.
- Bye.

1363
01:49:59,335 --> 01:50:00,960
Bye.
- Bye.

1364
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,126
Okay, okay bye.

1365
01:50:03,126 --> 01:50:05,543
God bless you, my son.

1366
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:08,668
What do you mean
you're shutting the case?

1367
01:50:09,043 --> 01:50:11,043
Understand it's been six months.

1368
01:50:11,043 --> 01:50:13,668
Okay, no witnesses, no suspects,
no evidence.

1369
01:50:13,668 --> 01:50:16,168
There's been no movement
on this case, Mrs. Khan.

1370
01:50:16,168 --> 01:50:17,960
Look, I really have no choice.

1371
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:20,293
But you know, maybe … maybe
there's somebody at school …

1372
01:50:20,293 --> 01:50:21,501
… who will remember something.

1373
01:50:21,501 --> 01:50:23,710
You know, maybe you can go
door to door, class to class.

1374
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:25,460
Door to door and homes,
and something …

1375
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:28,001
You know I've done that already.
- But, you know …

1376
01:50:28,001 --> 01:50:29,626
Maybe there's something
else that you'll find.

1377
01:50:29,626 --> 01:50:31,001
You see these files?

1378
01:50:31,376 --> 01:50:33,793
These are all those
waiting for justice too.

1379
01:50:34,418 --> 01:50:36,751
Look, I'm sorry,
Mrs. Khan. I truly am.

1380
01:50:37,001 --> 01:50:40,001
Sometimes there really
are no answers. - No.

1381
01:50:40,585 --> 01:50:42,626
I don't accept that.

1382
01:50:43,001 --> 01:50:45,168
I do not accept that.

1383
01:50:45,168 --> 01:50:47,460
There has to be an answer.

1384
01:50:49,001 --> 01:50:51,835
And if you can't find it, I will.

1385
01:51:15,543 --> 01:51:16,960
Hi.
- Hi.

1386
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,626
I'm looking for any lead on
the boys who killed my son.

1387
01:51:19,876 --> 01:51:23,085
Any information at all. My
number is there. - Okay.

1388
01:51:36,376 --> 01:51:38,835
I have reached Los Angeles now.

1389
01:51:39,918 --> 01:51:43,960
The President is coming
visit the college campus here.

1390
01:51:48,626 --> 01:51:51,001
I have reached
three days before him …

1391
01:51:51,001 --> 01:51:53,793
… so that I don't miss
him this time around.

1392
01:51:59,168 --> 01:52:02,626
I am going to pray that
Allah wills it so too.

1393
01:52:12,668 --> 01:52:15,168
Listen, listen, listen brothers.

1394
01:52:15,626 --> 01:52:17,668
We are digressing.

1395
01:52:18,085 --> 01:52:20,335
I have said it before.

1396
01:52:20,876 --> 01:52:25,251
I have no problem with
Christians or the Jews.

1397
01:52:26,376 --> 01:52:30,460
In fact, I have no problems
with our Hindu brothers too.

1398
01:52:30,918 --> 01:52:36,585
I treat a lot of Hindu
patients in St. Benedict's hospital.

1399
01:52:37,001 --> 01:52:40,335
I get angry only
when this same grace …

1400
01:52:40,335 --> 01:52:42,793
… is not
reciprocated towards us Muslims.

1401
01:52:43,043 --> 01:52:45,460
My blood boils …

1402
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:52,168
… when Israeli Jews
massacre our Palestinian brothers.

1403
01:52:52,668 --> 01:52:54,293
Or when Hindus in India …

1404
01:52:54,293 --> 01:52:57,585
… cut our women and children
to pieces with their swords.

1405
01:52:57,876 --> 01:53:02,376
That's when my blood boils.

1406
01:53:02,668 --> 01:53:05,210
Doesn't your blood boil? Answer me.

1407
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:07,001
Doesn't your blood boil?
- It does. It does.

1408
01:53:07,001 --> 01:53:08,460
It does. It does.

1409
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:11,835
So, do something then. Do something!

1410
01:53:13,585 --> 01:53:18,751
I, Dr. Faisal Rehman,
take an oath that I'm ready.

1411
01:53:18,751 --> 01:53:20,001
Are you people ready? Are you?

1412
01:53:20,001 --> 01:53:21,210
Yes, we are. Yes. Yes, we are.

1413
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:24,126
Are you people ready?

1414
01:53:24,126 --> 01:53:27,543
Yes, we are. Yes. Yes, we are.

1415
01:53:31,418 --> 01:53:37,710
Mighty Allah had even asked
Ibrahim to sacrifice his son.

1416
01:53:39,543 --> 01:53:46,460
And without asking a single question,
Ibrahim agreed to sacrifice him.

1417
01:53:47,376 --> 01:53:50,668
It's our turn today.

1418
01:53:50,668 --> 01:53:55,043
It's our duty to let our blood
flow for the cause of Islam.

1419
01:53:55,293 --> 01:53:56,960
This is what Allah demands!

1420
01:53:57,251 --> 01:54:01,168
This is what Islam demands!

1421
01:54:01,168 --> 01:54:05,585
No, no, no, no.

1422
01:54:05,876 --> 01:54:07,251
No.

1423
01:54:07,793 --> 01:54:10,751
You are lying.

1424
01:54:11,126 --> 01:54:12,876
Wait … Wait …

1425
01:54:13,126 --> 01:54:14,626
Why, brother?

1426
01:54:15,126 --> 01:54:18,210
Don't you believe that the Lord
had asked for Ismail's sacrifice?

1427
01:54:18,210 --> 01:54:20,001
No, no.

1428
01:54:21,376 --> 01:54:23,210
My Ammi has told me the story.

1429
01:54:24,126 --> 01:54:29,126
Saint Ibrahim did not doubt
the compassion of the Lord.

1430
01:54:29,126 --> 01:54:31,668
No, no, no. No.

1431
01:54:32,335 --> 01:54:35,626
The story is an example of his
immense strong faith and belief.

1432
01:54:36,293 --> 01:54:37,668
And that's the reason …

1433
01:54:38,793 --> 01:54:41,793
… why despite being incited
by a stranger repeatedly …

1434
01:54:42,626 --> 01:54:45,668
… Saint Ibrahim did not waver
from his path of righteousness.

1435
01:54:45,668 --> 01:54:47,001
No.

1436
01:54:47,001 --> 01:54:49,085
He didn't listen to the stranger.

1437
01:54:49,085 --> 01:54:53,710
He was sure Allah would never allow
the blood of his progeny to be shed.

1438
01:54:54,918 --> 01:54:56,460
And he was right.

1439
01:54:57,418 --> 01:55:01,585
The mighty Allah
saved Ismail's life.

1440
01:55:02,335 --> 01:55:06,168
My Ammi also said, "Rizvan …

1441
01:55:07,668 --> 01:55:13,835
… this story shows that the
path of Allah is that of love …

1442
01:55:13,835 --> 01:55:19,043
… not of hatred and war."

1443
01:55:21,543 --> 01:55:23,335
You are lying.

1444
01:55:23,335 --> 01:55:27,376
Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar.
- You are lying.

1445
01:55:27,376 --> 01:55:28,668
Look. The meaning of
the story is clear.

1446
01:55:28,668 --> 01:55:32,710
Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar.
- Our brother here speaks the truth.

1447
01:55:32,710 --> 01:55:34,501
Allah's path is that of compassion.

1448
01:55:34,501 --> 01:55:36,876
That's why his loved ones are called
'blessed by the compassionate!'

1449
01:55:36,876 --> 01:55:40,376
Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar.
Ask him who was that stranger?

1450
01:55:40,376 --> 01:55:41,501
I'm not lying!

1451
01:55:41,501 --> 01:55:42,751
You are lying!

1452
01:55:42,751 --> 01:55:44,710
Our times demand …
- Ask him …

1453
01:55:44,710 --> 01:55:47,751
The stranger who tried to
veer Ibrahim from his path …

1454
01:55:47,751 --> 01:55:48,960
… was he an infidel?

1455
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,085
How does it matter who he was?

1456
01:55:50,085 --> 01:55:51,460
But Doctor, who was he?

1457
01:55:51,460 --> 01:55:53,460
Listen I can explain everything.

1458
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:56,710
Brother, tell us who he was.

1459
01:56:03,251 --> 01:56:09,168
Satan! Satan! Satan!

1460
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:27,543
The world is strange, Mandira.

1461
01:56:27,543 --> 01:56:32,960
The more I try to understand
it the lesser I understand.

1462
01:56:33,668 --> 01:56:36,126
I miss you.

1463
01:56:40,001 --> 01:56:42,418
Hello.
- Hello.

1464
01:56:42,876 --> 01:56:45,710
Bhai … You? Where are you?

1465
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:49,960
FBI. Do you have a
number for the FBI?

1466
01:56:50,418 --> 01:56:52,835
FBI? Why?

1467
01:57:20,376 --> 01:57:21,710
Please.

1468
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:23,210
It's our college, and
they are pushing us around.

1469
01:57:23,210 --> 01:57:25,668
I wonder why they are so excited.
That too for this President.

1470
01:57:25,668 --> 01:57:27,835
Lousy pods of garlic!

1471
01:57:28,376 --> 01:57:29,835
I love it.

1472
01:57:29,835 --> 01:57:33,960
There are no better cusswords
than Indian ones. - Really.

1473
01:57:44,043 --> 01:57:46,293
Boys and girls.

1474
01:57:46,293 --> 01:57:49,585
Come on. This is the man
you waited for hours to see.

1475
01:57:49,585 --> 01:57:52,126
Let's give him a
warm round of applause.

1476
01:57:52,126 --> 01:57:55,835
I present to you,
the man, the legend.

1477
01:57:55,835 --> 01:57:59,251
The president of the
United States of America.

1478
01:58:00,793 --> 01:58:03,043
Alright, yes.

1479
01:58:07,168 --> 01:58:08,918
Alright, come on everybody.

1480
01:58:08,918 --> 01:58:12,585
Let's give this guy a nice
warm round of applause …

1481
01:58:12,585 --> 01:58:14,793
… for his esteemed support.

1482
01:58:17,293 --> 01:58:18,626
And there he is.

1483
01:58:18,626 --> 01:58:20,793
Alright everybody, alright.

1484
01:58:20,793 --> 01:58:23,710
Everybody, make some noise.

1485
01:58:23,710 --> 01:58:25,210
President.

1486
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:28,960
Mr. President.

1487
01:58:30,168 --> 01:58:32,168
Mr. President.

1488
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:40,335
Mr. President.

1489
01:58:44,001 --> 01:58:48,210
My name Khan, and
I'm not a terrorist.

1490
01:58:54,335 --> 01:58:56,543
Mr. President.

1491
01:58:57,543 --> 01:59:00,835
My name Khan, and
I'm not a terrorist.

1492
01:59:01,668 --> 01:59:03,335
Did he just say terrorist?

1493
01:59:03,335 --> 01:59:05,501
I'm not a terrorist.
- Terrorist!

1494
01:59:05,501 --> 01:59:09,460
He says he's a terrorist.
- I'm not a terrorist.

1495
01:59:17,293 --> 01:59:19,126
Move.

1496
01:59:40,543 --> 01:59:42,126
Don't move.

1497
01:59:43,001 --> 01:59:44,710
I got him.

1498
01:59:58,626 --> 02:00:00,585
Don't move, man. Don't move.

1499
02:00:00,585 --> 02:00:03,960
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

1500
02:00:08,085 --> 02:00:11,543
My name is Khan, and
I'm not a terrorist.

1501
02:00:12,001 --> 02:00:13,626
I don't understand.

1502
02:00:14,251 --> 02:00:16,043
He is strange.

1503
02:00:16,626 --> 02:00:18,585
First, he was standing silently.

1504
02:00:18,876 --> 02:00:20,126
Then all of a sudden,
he was screaming.

1505
02:00:20,126 --> 02:00:21,376
And what was he screaming …

1506
02:00:21,376 --> 02:00:24,793
I'm not a terrorist. I'm
not a terrorist. Strange.

1507
02:00:24,793 --> 02:00:26,835
There's something more to his story.

1508
02:00:27,085 --> 02:00:29,418
Yes. But why are
we after this story?

1509
02:00:29,793 --> 02:00:32,085
Listen, Raj. This
can't be our project.

1510
02:00:32,085 --> 02:00:35,085
I don't want to get into
this Khan story. I'm scared.

1511
02:00:35,085 --> 02:00:36,960
Scared because he is a Khan?

1512
02:00:37,626 --> 02:00:39,460
If he was a Khanna,
you wouldn't be, right?

1513
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:40,960
What do you mean?

1514
02:00:41,293 --> 02:00:43,210
You know what I'm saying, Komal.

1515
02:00:45,668 --> 02:00:48,043
Listen, this is
going to be my project.

1516
02:00:48,376 --> 02:00:50,251
Are you with me?

1517
02:00:54,835 --> 02:00:57,126
He's been following the
President for some weeks now.

1518
02:00:57,126 --> 02:01:00,668
And we … frankly can't know
whether he's a 'Jihadi' or not.

1519
02:01:02,418 --> 02:01:05,001
I have made a
mistake again, Mandira.

1520
02:01:05,001 --> 02:01:08,126
And now, the
President is angry with me.

1521
02:01:08,126 --> 02:01:10,626
He has even told the judge about it.

1522
02:01:11,001 --> 02:01:15,376
That's why the judge has
asked me to be shut away.

1523
02:01:26,710 --> 02:01:31,126
He has also ordered that I
should meet a psychiatrist.

1524
02:01:31,126 --> 02:01:34,835
He says he will meet me after that.

1525
02:01:34,835 --> 02:01:39,085
I will tell him then
that I'm not an enemy.

1526
02:01:39,085 --> 02:01:40,793
I'm not evil.

1527
02:01:40,793 --> 02:01:43,960
I am unable to say
anything now, Mandira.

1528
02:01:45,626 --> 02:01:48,543
I'm very scared.

1529
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:57,168
His name is Rizvan Khan.
- Rizvan Khan. - Yes.

1530
02:01:57,168 --> 02:01:58,626
They are not saying
anything beyond that right now.

1531
02:01:58,626 --> 02:02:01,210
I knew the police wasn't
going to tell us anything … Now?

1532
02:02:01,210 --> 02:02:04,293
Now what? There are
other ways of finding out.

1533
02:02:04,501 --> 02:02:05,876
Come on, let's go.

1534
02:02:07,168 --> 02:02:08,918
Guys, you know this is illegal.

1535
02:02:08,918 --> 02:02:11,585
Yes. And you never do
anything illegal, right?

1536
02:02:13,876 --> 02:02:16,668
Here. Complete
information on Rizvan Khan.

1537
02:02:16,668 --> 02:02:18,626
House, work address,
social security number.

1538
02:02:18,626 --> 02:02:21,251
Credit records, salary statement.
In short, his entire life!

1539
02:02:21,251 --> 02:02:24,001
Wow, dude, Inder you're a rockstar.
- Yes, thanks.

1540
02:02:24,001 --> 02:02:25,460
Bye.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1541
02:02:25,460 --> 02:02:26,918
Stay out of jail.

1542
02:02:27,126 --> 02:02:28,835
Yeah, I'll call you back. Bye.

1543
02:02:28,835 --> 02:02:31,501
Yeah, I'm telling you, it's a
great piece for your paper, okay.

1544
02:02:31,501 --> 02:02:33,418
This man, Rizvan Khan,
is a simple guy.

1545
02:02:33,418 --> 02:02:35,210
He sells beauty
products for a living.

1546
02:02:35,210 --> 02:02:36,460
Listen.

1547
02:02:36,460 --> 02:02:37,793
He's no enemy combatant.

1548
02:02:37,793 --> 02:02:39,001
That's what you think.

1549
02:02:39,001 --> 02:02:41,751
I just interviewed an extremist
in a Kabul prison last year.

1550
02:02:42,001 --> 02:02:44,960
He was just a tailor.
There's no story here, bud.

1551
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:52,210
This place is strange, Mandira.

1552
02:02:52,210 --> 02:02:56,793
There are no windows to any room
and the bathrooms don't have a door.

1553
02:02:57,043 --> 02:03:00,085
And the toilet has a lock.

1554
02:03:02,626 --> 02:03:06,043
My eyes burn and I feel sleepy too.

1555
02:03:07,710 --> 02:03:10,335
At times, it's very hot here.

1556
02:03:10,335 --> 02:03:12,335
At other times, it is very cold.

1557
02:03:12,335 --> 02:03:16,460
I told them I would
repair their air conditioner …

1558
02:03:16,918 --> 02:03:18,793
… but they won't let me.

1559
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:23,418
They don't even tell me
the time so that I can pray.

1560
02:03:23,418 --> 02:03:26,001
That's why every
time I feel scared …

1561
02:03:26,293 --> 02:03:29,418
I bow and pray.

1562
02:03:30,251 --> 02:03:32,960
Oh, sorry guys, sorry.
Give me two minutes, okay.

1563
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:34,835
Look, I've looked over the details.

1564
02:03:34,835 --> 02:03:36,460
I'm not really interested, but …

1565
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:38,293
… why don't you try
Bobby Ahuja, at PBC.

1566
02:03:38,293 --> 02:03:41,085
He might able to
help you. Okay. Alright.

1567
02:03:41,376 --> 02:03:44,001
But why? Why do you want
to meet the President?

1568
02:03:44,001 --> 02:03:46,501
Why do you know so
much about the President?

1569
02:03:46,501 --> 02:03:49,085
Why were you reading
up on the President?

1570
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:51,210
Do you know these people?

1571
02:03:51,210 --> 02:03:53,585
Azhar Mahmood, Omar Khan …

1572
02:03:53,585 --> 02:03:55,918
I think they are angry …

1573
02:03:55,918 --> 02:03:59,710
… because I'm not able to answer
their questions about the Al Qaeda.

1574
02:04:00,001 --> 02:04:03,001
But I don't know
anything about them.

1575
02:04:03,293 --> 02:04:07,793
Mandira, I should have
read up on Al Qaeda before.

1576
02:04:07,793 --> 02:04:11,585
Why? Why were you at
the Rally? Okay, what?

1577
02:04:13,210 --> 02:04:15,293
It's time for his session with me.

1578
02:04:15,626 --> 02:04:17,585
As ordered by the judge.

1579
02:04:18,335 --> 02:04:22,376
Do you really buy this, "My wife
told me to meet the President" shit?"

1580
02:04:22,376 --> 02:04:24,501
Would it matter if I said yes?

1581
02:04:26,043 --> 02:04:27,210
Hello.
- Hi.

1582
02:04:27,210 --> 02:04:30,376
Raj.
- Raj, Bobby Ahuja. Please sit.

1583
02:04:33,376 --> 02:04:37,043
I didn't have your number or I
would have called to tell you that …

1584
02:04:37,043 --> 02:04:40,085
… I can't cover the
Rizvan Khan story.

1585
02:04:40,085 --> 02:04:42,210
I have a busy schedule.

1586
02:04:42,626 --> 02:04:45,418
I have no time for
another two months.

1587
02:04:46,001 --> 02:04:48,960
You know otherwise, you know
I would've done something.

1588
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:51,668
But … you know what I mean?

1589
02:04:51,668 --> 02:04:54,210
If you don't mind me asking, sir.

1590
02:04:54,626 --> 02:04:57,668
Was this photograph
taken before 9/11?

1591
02:04:59,543 --> 02:05:01,501
Yes. Why?

1592
02:05:04,085 --> 02:05:05,293
What's so funny?

1593
02:05:05,293 --> 02:05:09,335
No, it's not funny at all actually.

1594
02:05:10,543 --> 02:05:14,335
They confused a Sikh for a Muslim
and you changed your entire life.

1595
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:18,501
And here, they are not even
treating a Muslim like a human …

1596
02:05:19,001 --> 02:05:20,668
… and you aren't able
to change your schedule?

1597
02:05:23,335 --> 02:05:25,168
Thank you for your time, sir.

1598
02:05:36,376 --> 02:05:38,793
You have one new message.

1599
02:05:38,793 --> 02:05:41,960
Hi Raj, this is
Bobby Ahuja from PBC.

1600
02:05:42,168 --> 02:05:44,210
Don't forget to
watch the news tomorrow.

1601
02:05:45,793 --> 02:05:49,001
My name is Khan, and
I'm not a terrorist.

1602
02:05:49,001 --> 02:05:50,585
Mr. President.

1603
02:05:50,585 --> 02:05:52,918
Rizvan Khan of Banville
California was arrested …

1604
02:05:52,918 --> 02:05:56,001
… on June 15th at the
CLA Presidential Rally.

1605
02:05:56,001 --> 02:05:57,543
He has been accused
of being a terrorist …

1606
02:05:57,543 --> 02:05:59,501
… and has been jailed
for the last 15 days.

1607
02:05:59,501 --> 02:06:01,001
Without any evidence.

1608
02:06:01,001 --> 02:06:03,210
And without legal representation.

1609
02:06:03,210 --> 02:06:06,501
And today, we have with us Mr.
and Mrs. Zakir Khan.

1610
02:06:06,501 --> 02:06:07,835
Family of Rizvan Khan.

1611
02:06:07,835 --> 02:06:10,793
Imran, the Khan from the bus is
on PBC. Quick, switch on the TV!

1612
02:06:10,793 --> 02:06:13,376
Very angry and very upset.

1613
02:06:14,210 --> 02:06:16,793
I mean, how can anyone
call him a terrorist?

1614
02:06:17,835 --> 02:06:19,543
That too without any evidence.

1615
02:06:19,543 --> 02:06:22,960
Tell them how last month
Bhai called for the FBI.

1616
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:26,710
Bhai had called last month.
He wanted the number for the FBI.

1617
02:06:26,710 --> 02:06:31,210
He wanted to report some terrorist
recruiter called, Dr. Faisal Rehman.

1618
02:06:32,001 --> 02:06:35,501
Yo, how's business, asshole?

1619
02:06:36,168 --> 02:06:37,876
Fuck you.

1620
02:06:38,168 --> 02:06:41,168
I mean we're told to
report suspicious characters.

1621
02:06:41,168 --> 02:06:44,001
Participate in … protecting
the country from extremists.

1622
02:06:44,001 --> 02:06:45,876
And then when we do that …

1623
02:06:45,876 --> 02:06:48,501
… we're just put into
the jail, like my brother.

1624
02:06:48,501 --> 02:06:51,918
Yeah, this is judge Preston,
can you give me the FBI please?

1625
02:06:52,251 --> 02:06:55,668
The question over here is, not why
he's trying to meet the President.

1626
02:06:55,668 --> 02:06:57,710
The question is, what's
wrong in an ordinary citizen …

1627
02:06:57,710 --> 02:06:59,835
… wanting to meet the
President of his country?

1628
02:07:00,460 --> 02:07:04,168
Or is it just wrong for
a Muslim man to even try?

1629
02:07:06,501 --> 02:07:09,793
And as Rizvan Khan
continues to be treated as guilty …

1630
02:07:09,793 --> 02:07:14,918
… until proven innocent, for
PBC News, my name is Bobby Ahuja.

1631
02:07:15,293 --> 02:07:16,960
And I'm not a terrorist.

1632
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:19,251
He is right. Zakir Bhai is right.

1633
02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:24,585
We are told to report to the
government any information …

1634
02:07:24,585 --> 02:07:27,626
… we have on any terrorist activity.

1635
02:07:28,251 --> 02:07:31,876
And when we do that,
what happens is before you.

1636
02:07:32,126 --> 02:07:35,251
Why is this being
asked over and over again?

1637
02:07:35,251 --> 02:07:37,960
"Why does Khan want to
meet the President?"

1638
02:07:38,293 --> 02:07:43,210
What's the harm if an ordinary
citizen wants to meet the President?

1639
02:07:43,210 --> 02:07:44,835
What's wrong?

1640
02:07:44,835 --> 02:07:48,585
Or then tell us clearly that
Muslims don't have right to do so.

1641
02:07:51,293 --> 02:07:53,626
Yes, good afternoon.
This is Tracy Brennan …

1642
02:07:53,626 --> 02:07:57,001
… Chairperson of the American
Autistic society in San Francisco.

1643
02:07:57,001 --> 02:07:59,793
Would you put me on to your
officer in-charge of the …

1644
02:07:59,793 --> 02:08:02,001
… Rizvan Khan case, please?

1645
02:08:02,001 --> 02:08:04,501
This is about the Rizvan Khan case.

1646
02:08:04,876 --> 02:08:08,001
Any information you
have on Rizvan Khan.

1647
02:08:08,251 --> 02:08:09,918
Look I've been calling all morning.

1648
02:08:09,918 --> 02:08:13,251
I need to know where Rizvan
Khan has been taken, please.

1649
02:08:16,585 --> 02:08:17,918
Hello, hello.

1650
02:08:17,918 --> 02:08:21,126
My name is Rizvan Khan.
Khan, from the epiglottis.

1651
02:08:21,126 --> 02:08:23,460
I want to report a man.

1652
02:08:23,460 --> 02:08:25,376
I have to report a man.

1653
02:08:25,376 --> 02:08:29,335
I met him at a downtown mosque.

1654
02:08:29,335 --> 02:08:31,876
His name is Dr. Faisal Rehman.

1655
02:08:31,876 --> 02:08:35,085
Faisal Rehman, he works at
the St. Benedicts Hospital.

1656
02:08:35,085 --> 02:08:37,001
He is a bad man.

1657
02:08:37,001 --> 02:08:39,460
He is a very bad man.

1658
02:08:41,168 --> 02:08:44,251
Your call helped
them arrest Dr. Rehman.

1659
02:08:44,501 --> 02:08:46,960
Eight others were arrested with him.

1660
02:08:47,835 --> 02:08:50,210
It's a big catch, Rizvan.

1661
02:08:50,210 --> 02:08:52,001
You are free to go now.

1662
02:08:52,001 --> 02:08:54,001
You are free.

1663
02:09:12,210 --> 02:09:13,751
Hey, watch it.

1664
02:09:20,001 --> 02:09:23,168
Finally, Rizvan Khan's
innocence has been proved.

1665
02:09:23,543 --> 02:09:26,251
He will be freed in a few moments.

1666
02:09:26,668 --> 02:09:28,043
A small, but increasing
group of supporters …

1667
02:09:28,043 --> 02:09:29,918
… have gathered here today …

1668
02:09:29,918 --> 02:09:31,960
… and have shown
no signs of leaving.

1669
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:36,668
Bano, come quickly! Rizvan Khan
has been released. He's been freed.

1670
02:09:44,210 --> 02:09:47,210
Bare Essentials Mystique,
Mandira's perfume …

1671
02:09:47,793 --> 02:09:52,626
35 dollars, 99 cents.
On sale now, at Walmart.

1672
02:09:53,585 --> 02:09:55,710
Hey, you famous or something?

1673
02:09:55,710 --> 02:09:58,210
On sale now at Walmart.
- You some Guru or something?

1674
02:09:58,210 --> 02:10:00,751
Some crazy lady was just
here shouting about your …

1675
02:10:00,751 --> 02:10:03,293
… innocence and what not.
- Crazy lady. Mandira.

1676
02:10:03,668 --> 02:10:05,043
Mandira was here.

1677
02:10:05,543 --> 02:10:07,543
Crazy lady, Mandira was here.

1678
02:10:07,543 --> 02:10:08,626
Where did she go?

1679
02:10:09,126 --> 02:10:11,501
Where did she go?

1680
02:10:11,835 --> 02:10:14,001
Where did she go?
- She went out the back way.

1681
02:10:21,793 --> 02:10:23,001
Mandira.

1682
02:10:24,918 --> 02:10:26,043
Mandira.

1683
02:10:32,251 --> 02:10:33,418
Mandira.

1684
02:11:36,418 --> 02:11:39,793
Sorry Mandira, I couldn't meet you …

1685
02:11:40,126 --> 02:11:42,876
… since I haven't
fulfilled my promise to you yet.

1686
02:11:46,710 --> 02:11:50,960
But somehow Mandira,
as soon as I saw you …

1687
02:11:51,335 --> 02:11:53,960
… the pain in my chest vanished.

1688
02:11:58,376 --> 02:12:00,210
Where did Rizvan Khan go?

1689
02:12:00,376 --> 02:12:03,418
And why does he want to meet
the President? No one knows.

1690
02:12:03,751 --> 02:12:05,543
So why he wants to
meet the President …

1691
02:12:05,543 --> 02:12:08,751
… and what is his message about
continues to remain a mystery.

1692
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:11,001
This is Bobby Ahuja, PBC news.
- Yeah, so …

1693
02:12:11,335 --> 02:12:13,085
Thank you so much for
this internship, sir.

1694
02:12:13,085 --> 02:12:14,460
We promise not to let you …

1695
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:16,668
Thank me later …
First find this Khan …

1696
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:19,418
His story has moved
thousands of Muslims.

1697
02:12:20,210 --> 02:12:22,251
I wish I knew where Bhai was, Raj.

1698
02:12:22,418 --> 02:12:23,710
He calls me.

1699
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:28,251
Yeah. Yeah, next time he
calls me I'll let you know.

1700
02:12:32,751 --> 02:12:34,251
Yo, Paki loser.

1701
02:12:44,210 --> 02:12:46,710
Hey! My name is Abdul!

1702
02:12:48,126 --> 02:12:50,168
You want a piece of me.

1703
02:12:51,460 --> 02:12:53,543
You show me the finger?
- Enough, okay buddy.

1704
02:12:53,751 --> 02:12:56,126
Come, I'll show you once
and for all. - I'm done.

1705
02:12:56,126 --> 02:12:57,251
Come I'll show you!

1706
02:12:58,001 --> 02:12:59,001
What you looking at?

1707
02:13:17,543 --> 02:13:22,293
For a while now I have
been fighting with myself.

1708
02:13:22,710 --> 02:13:28,168
I teach you about identity when my
own has been changed so drastically.

1709
02:13:30,001 --> 02:13:33,668
My hijab is not just
my religious identity.

1710
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:39,835
It is a part of my existence.

1711
02:13:42,376 --> 02:13:44,460
Khan stayed in room 22 only.

1712
02:13:45,168 --> 02:13:46,876
You want to stay in the same room?

1713
02:13:47,210 --> 02:13:51,335
Only 25 dollars extra,
to be a part of history.

1714
02:13:52,251 --> 02:13:55,376
And mind you, my name is Jitesh.

1715
02:13:55,751 --> 02:13:57,751
And I'm not a terrorist.

1716
02:13:58,710 --> 02:14:00,960
Mummy, I want to tell
you something today.

1717
02:14:01,876 --> 02:14:04,126
Today I'm proud to
be a computer hacker.

1718
02:14:06,001 --> 02:14:07,418
Ya … I have eaten already.

1719
02:14:07,585 --> 02:14:09,043
At least listen to
what I'm saying first.

1720
02:14:18,335 --> 02:14:24,376
Hurricane Molly … now
moving at 125 miles per hour …

1721
02:14:24,376 --> 02:14:26,460
… has severely hit
the southern coast.

1722
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:29,085
And the authorities around the
southern region have been alerted.

1723
02:14:29,251 --> 02:14:32,043
We now go live to Alex,
who's on location.

1724
02:14:32,210 --> 02:14:33,376
Thank you, Janice.

1725
02:14:33,376 --> 02:14:34,751
Attention all passengers …

1726
02:14:35,085 --> 02:14:38,293
… E-52 bus to Portland has
been delayed by 10 minutes.

1727
02:14:38,293 --> 02:14:41,585
Again, E-52 Portland bus
has a ten minute delay.

1728
02:14:41,585 --> 02:14:42,960
We regret the inconvenience.

1729
02:14:43,210 --> 02:14:45,585
We have a fresh update,
this just in.

1730
02:14:45,585 --> 02:14:48,460
We've news that the hurricane
has hit Wilhemina, Georgia.

1731
02:14:48,460 --> 02:14:51,293
I repeat, Wilhemina,
Georgia has been hit.

1732
02:14:51,293 --> 02:14:53,210
Full on by hurricane Molly.

1733
02:14:53,918 --> 02:14:56,960
At this point we don't
have any indication as to …

1734
02:14:56,960 --> 02:15:04,168
Mama Jenny … Mama
Jenny I have to go to her.

1735
02:15:18,585 --> 02:15:22,293
Raj … Bhai called … You wanted
to know where he was, didn't you?

1736
02:15:22,501 --> 02:15:23,751
Yes, Zakir bhai?

1737
02:15:23,751 --> 02:15:25,251
He's going to Wilhemina.

1738
02:15:25,251 --> 02:15:30,043
Wilhemina? That's in Georgia, right?

1739
02:15:30,043 --> 02:15:31,418
Ya … Somewhere there.

1740
02:15:32,001 --> 02:15:33,126
What is he doing there?

1741
02:15:33,126 --> 02:15:35,168
He said that he has to
meet some Mama Jenny there.

1742
02:16:07,751 --> 02:16:12,085
Mandira, there's going to be a
delay in meeting the President.

1743
02:16:13,710 --> 02:16:15,710
I have come to Wilhemina, Georgia.

1744
02:16:16,126 --> 02:16:20,126
Mama Jenny and Funny
hair Joel are in trouble.

1745
02:16:20,501 --> 02:16:23,126
There's too much
water here, Mandira …

1746
02:16:23,543 --> 02:16:27,251
… and I don't think
Mama Jenny can swim.

1747
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:29,751
She's a little fat.

1748
02:17:26,168 --> 02:17:28,460
Rizvan. Mama Rizvan.

1749
02:17:29,126 --> 02:17:32,876
Rizvan. What are you doing here?

1750
02:17:33,460 --> 02:17:40,168
Mama Jenny, I'm happy, Funny
hair Joel and you are not dead.

1751
02:17:40,168 --> 02:17:41,835
I'm happy.

1752
02:17:44,585 --> 02:17:46,668
Thank you for coming, Rizvan.

1753
02:17:47,210 --> 02:17:50,626
But you should not be here.
- I'm happy, I'm here.

1754
02:17:50,626 --> 02:17:51,793
No, you must go.

1755
02:17:52,001 --> 02:17:53,876
No, you must go.
- No, no, no.

1756
02:17:53,876 --> 02:17:55,210
Listen to me.
- No, no, no.

1757
02:17:56,376 --> 02:17:57,751
You should not be here.

1758
02:17:58,126 --> 02:18:01,335
This one you cannot repair. Now go.

1759
02:18:16,668 --> 02:18:18,126
Mama, Rizvan.

1760
02:18:22,293 --> 02:18:24,626
Oh, God the church is going to fall.

1761
02:18:24,626 --> 02:18:25,960
We're going to die.

1762
02:18:26,418 --> 02:18:28,043
The church is going to fall.

1763
02:19:19,335 --> 02:19:22,751
Hadith says that the Almighty
does not judge by colour or creed …

1764
02:19:22,751 --> 02:19:24,085
… but by actions and deeds.

1765
02:19:24,085 --> 02:19:25,293
If that is the truth …

1766
02:19:25,293 --> 02:19:27,335
… then Rizvan Khan by the
sheer force of his actions …

1767
02:19:27,335 --> 02:19:30,085
… has elevated the entire
humanity in the eyes of God.

1768
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:33,710
Just recently this
man was arrested …

1769
02:19:33,710 --> 02:19:36,751
… and tortured for being an
enemy combatant of this country.

1770
02:19:37,585 --> 02:19:40,001
Wonder what the government
officials would call this …

1771
02:19:40,001 --> 02:19:41,960
… Muslim enemy combatant today?

1772
02:19:42,293 --> 02:19:45,835
As he selflessly tries to save
the remaining lives in Wilhemina.

1773
02:19:45,835 --> 02:19:48,335
Just a few days ago this
man was called a terrorist …

1774
02:19:48,335 --> 02:19:49,835
… and tortured mercilessly.

1775
02:19:49,835 --> 02:19:52,043
Today we wait for the response
of the government officials …

1776
02:19:52,376 --> 02:19:55,918
… as he tirelessly
strives to save innocent lives.

1777
02:19:55,918 --> 02:19:58,001
If the authorities want
to find the true enemy …

1778
02:19:58,001 --> 02:19:59,418
… combatant of this country.

1779
02:19:59,710 --> 02:20:03,376
Then they would find it in the
grief and debris of Wilhemina.

1780
02:20:04,001 --> 02:20:06,501
It's a long journey
to change the world.

1781
02:20:07,001 --> 02:20:11,710
But the first few steps have been
taken by Rizvan Khan in Wilhemina.

1782
02:20:13,293 --> 02:20:16,085
Isn't it our duty now to
take this journey forward?

1783
02:20:16,876 --> 02:20:18,710
Raj Burman, Star News.

1784
02:20:29,376 --> 02:20:35,626
Please don't take my
baby away from me.

1785
02:20:37,876 --> 02:20:41,585
Mandira, people are suffering
here and are very helpless.

1786
02:20:42,543 --> 02:20:46,543
I wish I could take
all of them from here.

1787
02:20:46,876 --> 02:20:49,043
But I don't have the
physical strength to do that.

1788
02:20:52,001 --> 02:20:54,085
Mama Jenny is right …

1789
02:20:54,626 --> 02:20:57,960
This one … this one I can't repair.

1790
02:21:01,376 --> 02:21:04,876
Now we can only await
the Lord's merciful eye.

1791
02:21:12,585 --> 02:21:14,543
Mama! Mama!

1792
02:21:15,876 --> 02:21:18,543
Mama! Mama!

1793
02:22:15,210 --> 02:22:17,335
While several hurricane hit areas …

1794
02:22:17,335 --> 02:22:19,501
… have suffered from
government inaction.

1795
02:22:19,501 --> 02:22:23,335
One small town in Georgia is
slowly getting back on its feet.

1796
02:22:24,043 --> 02:22:26,751
This group has brought
something more valuable than money.

1797
02:22:27,001 --> 02:22:28,376
They brought themselves.

1798
02:22:29,001 --> 02:22:31,335
The US government may
have forgotten the flood …

1799
02:22:31,335 --> 02:22:33,085
… inflicted area of Wilhemina,
Georgia …

1800
02:22:33,085 --> 02:22:35,043
… but one man has
refused to be indifferent …

1801
02:22:35,043 --> 02:22:37,126
… to the plight of its inhabitants.

1802
02:22:37,293 --> 02:22:39,835
This one man has spared
no efforts in helping …

1803
02:22:39,835 --> 02:22:43,043
… rehabilitate the
population of Wilhemina.

1804
02:22:43,876 --> 02:22:46,376
Looking at him as an
inspiration today …

1805
02:22:46,376 --> 02:22:49,085
… many Americans have
rushed to Wilhemina …

1806
02:22:49,085 --> 02:22:53,293
… and its neighbouring towns to help
in rebuilding the destroyed towns.

1807
02:22:53,501 --> 02:22:56,210
And all this just
because of one man …

1808
02:22:56,210 --> 02:22:58,501
… whose name is Rizvan Khan …

1809
02:22:58,501 --> 02:23:02,085
… and who, in his own words,
is not a 'terrorist'…

1810
02:23:13,293 --> 02:23:15,043
Following the example of Wilhemina …

1811
02:23:15,043 --> 02:23:17,210
… towns are being
adopted across the country.

1812
02:23:17,585 --> 02:23:19,710
And while our military
is tied up in Iraq …

1813
02:23:19,710 --> 02:23:21,376
… reconstruction of these towns …

1814
02:23:21,585 --> 02:23:24,335
… has been taken on
by ordinary Americans.

1815
02:23:24,585 --> 02:23:28,210
And today, as our
special guest from Wilhemina …

1816
02:23:28,210 --> 02:23:30,085
… we have the man, who
got the whole ball rolling.

1817
02:23:30,376 --> 02:23:31,876
Mr. Rizvan Khan.

1818
02:23:32,126 --> 02:23:36,168
Oh no, no, no it's Khan.
- Excuse me.

1819
02:23:36,168 --> 02:23:38,418
Khan.
- Excuse me.

1820
02:23:38,751 --> 02:23:40,001
Khan.
- One minute.

1821
02:23:40,001 --> 02:23:41,960
From the epiglottis, ma'am. Khan.

1822
02:23:42,460 --> 02:23:43,626
I'm sorry, Rizvan.

1823
02:23:44,085 --> 02:23:46,710
Maybe you could tell us why
you want to meet the president?

1824
02:23:47,418 --> 02:23:50,543
Senator, you need to take a look
at these campaign accounts. - Later.

1825
02:23:50,543 --> 02:23:51,585
I want to watch this.

1826
02:23:52,793 --> 02:23:54,751
My beautiful wife, Mandira.

1827
02:23:55,710 --> 02:24:02,710
She … she told me to go and
meet the President of America.

1828
02:24:03,126 --> 02:24:06,460
A long tiring journey,
Rizvan. What kept you going?

1829
02:24:06,460 --> 02:24:09,210
My son's soccer shoes.

1830
02:24:09,460 --> 02:24:14,585
My son Sam, and his best friend
Reese, they they love playing soccer.

1831
02:24:23,001 --> 02:24:25,126
I'm sorry Mrs. Khan,
I didn't know what to do.

1832
02:24:25,126 --> 02:24:27,835
And I was scared. And
they threatened hurt me.

1833
02:24:27,835 --> 02:24:29,168
And I'm sorry.

1834
02:24:29,168 --> 02:24:31,710
I'm just really, really sorry.

1835
02:24:31,710 --> 02:24:37,210
I'm sorry Mrs …
- Sorry is not good enough.

1836
02:24:39,210 --> 02:24:41,210
That's just not good enough.

1837
02:25:15,626 --> 02:25:17,501
Thank you for asking
for leniency for me.

1838
02:25:20,460 --> 02:25:23,043
I didn't do it for you,
I did it for your mom.

1839
02:25:24,501 --> 02:25:25,876
My mom won't forgive me.

1840
02:25:27,668 --> 02:25:30,001
She will. She's a mom.

1841
02:26:10,210 --> 02:26:12,585
Mandira, this is Sarah.

1842
02:26:13,293 --> 02:26:14,460
Thanks.

1843
02:26:14,460 --> 02:26:16,626
Thank you for Reese.

1844
02:26:18,460 --> 02:26:20,460
And I hope and pray that
Sam's soul rests in peace.

1845
02:26:23,585 --> 02:26:28,668
Mandira, we both know what it
feels like to lose people we love.

1846
02:26:29,126 --> 02:26:31,835
I lost my husband to hate.

1847
02:26:31,835 --> 02:26:33,626
Don't lose Rizvan.

1848
02:26:33,876 --> 02:26:40,460
Let go of your anger, just let go.

1849
02:26:53,793 --> 02:26:55,001
I love you son.

1850
02:27:12,001 --> 02:27:13,460
Zakir, Hasina.

1851
02:27:14,085 --> 02:27:15,418
I'm leaving now … Bye, bye.

1852
02:27:15,626 --> 02:27:18,460
Bhai why do you have to
leave so late at night?

1853
02:27:18,793 --> 02:27:20,543
I've to go now.

1854
02:27:20,543 --> 02:27:22,293
It is three days to the
Presidential election.

1855
02:27:22,626 --> 02:27:23,876
After that the
President will change.

1856
02:27:23,876 --> 02:27:25,585
I have to meet him before that.

1857
02:27:25,751 --> 02:27:27,960
Now, I need to meet
him now. Now, now.

1858
02:28:44,085 --> 02:28:45,710
Leave me!

1859
02:28:45,876 --> 02:28:48,876
You got Dr. Rehman arrested!

1860
02:28:49,126 --> 02:28:52,085
You are an infidel! This
is your punishment, Khan!

1861
02:28:52,460 --> 02:28:54,251
This is your punishment!
You have to die!

1862
02:28:54,793 --> 02:28:56,501
Islam will never forgive you!

1863
02:28:56,751 --> 02:28:58,001
Leave me!

1864
02:28:58,418 --> 02:29:01,376
Oh Lord!!

1865
02:29:01,751 --> 02:29:05,501
The United States of
America has a new President.

1866
02:29:05,501 --> 02:29:06,751
Doctor, he just got up.

1867
02:29:06,751 --> 02:29:08,710
Let me check all
his vitals, lets go.

1868
02:29:47,793 --> 02:29:50,876
There are only two kinds
of people in this world.

1869
02:29:53,710 --> 02:29:56,710
He died because of you.
Because of your surname!

1870
02:29:58,793 --> 02:30:00,168
Leave me alone.

1871
02:30:00,918 --> 02:30:03,376
Go right now! This instant!

1872
02:30:03,376 --> 02:30:05,876
Go now, now.

1873
02:30:08,168 --> 02:30:09,835
When should I come back, Mandira?

1874
02:30:52,460 --> 02:30:55,501
I … I didn't die, Mandira.

1875
02:30:57,710 --> 02:31:01,001
No, you didn't.

1876
02:31:03,751 --> 02:31:07,168
Can I get a hug, please?

1877
02:31:07,668 --> 02:31:08,876
Please.

1878
02:31:17,418 --> 02:31:20,585
I love you.
- I know.

1879
02:31:21,335 --> 02:31:22,668
I love you too.

1880
02:31:33,293 --> 02:31:35,960
Today the President elect visits
flood inflicted Georgia State.

1881
02:31:36,418 --> 02:31:38,626
The question is
whether Rizvan Khan …

1882
02:31:38,626 --> 02:31:42,918
… who has just been discharged from
the hospital will get to meet him.

1883
02:31:43,251 --> 02:31:48,168
Khan has refused to go back home
until he meets the President elect.

1884
02:31:48,335 --> 02:31:49,835
Raj Burman … Star News.

1885
02:31:51,501 --> 02:31:53,876
Khan … let's go home. You
don't need to do this now.

1886
02:31:53,876 --> 02:31:55,085
No, no, no.

1887
02:31:55,085 --> 02:31:57,293
Why?
- No, no, no.

1888
02:31:57,293 --> 02:31:59,793
I have to meet the President.

1889
02:32:00,418 --> 02:32:05,418
Ammi had said, "A Khan
always keeps his word!"

1890
02:32:07,918 --> 02:32:11,960
Folks, we'll make sure
we do everything we can …

1891
02:32:11,960 --> 02:32:14,376
… to bring Georgia back on its feet.

1892
02:32:16,085 --> 02:32:17,168
Thank you.

1893
02:32:19,376 --> 02:32:21,668
After winning the election …

1894
02:32:21,668 --> 02:32:23,210
… the President elect in
his first Presidential tour …

1895
02:32:23,210 --> 02:32:25,126
… has announced a
special relief package …

1896
02:32:25,335 --> 02:32:27,335
… for the flood
inflicted Georgia State.

1897
02:32:31,376 --> 02:32:33,918
After offering aid to
the state of Georgia …

1898
02:32:33,918 --> 02:32:36,418
The President will go to
New York from here to …

1899
02:32:36,418 --> 02:32:38,585
… participate in the
United Nations' special summit.

1900
02:32:42,626 --> 02:32:45,960
Back off please, clear the area.
Please clear the area.

1901
02:32:46,126 --> 02:32:48,335
The President has left. Please.

1902
02:32:48,335 --> 02:32:49,543
That's Rizvan Khan.

1903
02:32:49,543 --> 02:32:52,460
Please back. - I want to see the
President. - President's left please.

1904
02:32:52,460 --> 02:32:56,001
Rizvan Khan who has been in the news
for all his efforts in Wilhemina …

1905
02:32:56,001 --> 02:32:57,960
… is now at the Governor's mansion.

1906
02:32:59,751 --> 02:33:03,710
He has been trying to meet
the President for a while now.

1907
02:33:03,710 --> 02:33:08,418
It's sad that he won't
meet the President even today.

1908
02:33:08,418 --> 02:33:10,918
Rizvan Khan's supporters are
quite dejected at this prospect.

1909
02:33:10,918 --> 02:33:14,376
However it looks like he'll face
disappointment all over again.

1910
02:33:14,918 --> 02:33:17,501
A disappointed group
of Khan's supporters …

1911
02:33:17,501 --> 02:33:19,710
… are getting ready to turn back.

1912
02:33:21,501 --> 02:33:23,168
Copy that, Regal is on foot.

1913
02:33:24,376 --> 02:33:26,876
Repeat that please.
- Regal is on foot.

1914
02:33:55,668 --> 02:33:57,960
Are you Rizvan Khan?
- Yes, sir.

1915
02:33:57,960 --> 02:33:59,085
Yes.
- Yes, sir.

1916
02:33:59,085 --> 02:34:00,251
The President wants to meet you.

1917
02:34:35,001 --> 02:34:37,168
Greetings …

1918
02:34:38,126 --> 02:34:41,751
Rizvan Khan, good to
see you hale and hearty.

1919
02:34:42,710 --> 02:34:44,210
You're on TV more than me now.

1920
02:34:44,210 --> 02:34:46,001
Mandira. He knows my name.

1921
02:34:46,210 --> 02:34:48,626
You already know my name.
- Yes, I do.

1922
02:34:49,043 --> 02:34:50,418
Your name is Khan.
- Yes.

1923
02:34:50,668 --> 02:34:53,960
And you're not a terrorist.
- Oh no, no I'm not a terrorist. No.

1924
02:34:54,210 --> 02:34:57,960
And … this is my son.

1925
02:35:00,168 --> 02:35:04,960
He … he wasn't a terrorist either.
My son. - I know.

1926
02:35:05,293 --> 02:35:06,460
You know.

1927
02:35:08,126 --> 02:35:10,501
I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Okay.

1928
02:35:10,501 --> 02:35:11,751
Yeah, thank you.

1929
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:15,126
He's sorry.

1930
02:35:17,293 --> 02:35:21,710
All of us share this world
before brief moment in time.

1931
02:35:22,460 --> 02:35:27,626
And I'm honoured to share
the time of Rizvan Khan.

1932
02:35:31,001 --> 02:35:32,960
Rizvan has reminded us …

1933
02:35:33,876 --> 02:35:35,085
Sam …

1934
02:35:36,043 --> 02:35:40,501
Our Khan has managed to achieve,
with his love and humanity …

1935
02:35:41,126 --> 02:35:43,001
… what my hatred
could never achieve.

1936
02:35:44,168 --> 02:35:45,918
My anger threw us apart …

1937
02:35:46,918 --> 02:35:50,376
… but today his love has
brought us together in a way …

1938
02:35:50,918 --> 02:35:54,168
… where we remember
you with renewed hope.

1939
02:36:03,293 --> 02:36:05,751
Now I will never let
him go anywhere, Sam.

1940
02:36:06,793 --> 02:36:09,126
I will keep this love with me …

1941
02:36:10,751 --> 02:36:15,835
For me … For you … Forever!

1942
02:36:19,210 --> 02:36:21,751
Anything else, Rizvan?
- Yes.

1943
02:36:22,168 --> 02:36:26,376
John Marshall, Homeland security,
San Francisco said to say, "Howdy".

1944
02:36:27,501 --> 02:36:28,960
Howdy?
- Howdy.

1945
02:36:29,918 --> 02:36:33,501
I tell you what, security has
any other messages, you call me.

1946
02:36:33,668 --> 02:36:35,251
Good, good can I
have your number please?

1947
02:36:36,001 --> 02:36:38,460

- Thank you.

1948
02:36:38,460 --> 02:36:40,210
Shall we go home?
- Yes, let's go home.
