1
00:01:04,406 --> 00:01:06,806
Thank you. Have a nice day.

2
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,446
Hello, Mr Chandler.

3
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:09,926
Hey, Alice. How are you?

4
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:13,086
Bec and Mrs Chandler
have a nice time in Thredbo?

5
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:16,486
A lovely time. Thank you very much.

6
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:19,886
Has Bec started exams yet?

7
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:22,566
Uh, next week, I...

8
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:26,886
Oh, shit.

9
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:31,166
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

10
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:35,566
Just hit me!

11
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:38,246
Come on. Just hit me.
I'll give you a free shot.

12
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:39,726
Leave my property, please.

13
00:01:39,886 --> 00:01:43,286
Barn, hit me, you fuckwit!
Come on, come on!

14
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:44,806
I deserve it.
Would you shut up?

15
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:46,286
The kids are home.
OK, sorry, sorry.

16
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:50,086
Look, Barn, I know this isn't
a usual cock-up, mate.

17
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:54,086
I know I can't excuse it
by saying that we were drunk

18
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:56,326
or that I was simply trying
to comfort your wife.

19
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:57,806
Save your bullshit
for the courtroom.

20
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:00,406
It's not bullshit, mate.
I have too much respect for you.

21
00:02:00,566 --> 00:02:02,126
Oh, respect?!

22
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:05,366
How dare you
talk about respect to me!

23
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,006
You see, this is your problem.

24
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:10,726
You can talk about respect,
talk about it brilliantly.

25
00:02:10,886 --> 00:02:13,246
I'm sure you can quote
Shakespeare or Einstein

26
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:15,606
or Groucho on the subject.

27
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:17,606
But what makes you a tragedy

28
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:20,086
is that as well as you
can talk about respect,

29
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:22,966
you never fucking give it.

30
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:25,246
You're a selfish turd.

31
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:29,166
So for the hundredth time, piss off!

32
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:51,246
Hi, mate.

33
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:53,966
Come in?
Nup.

34
00:02:54,126 --> 00:02:55,886
I beg your pardon?

35
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:58,126
Mum doesn't want you here
and I don't want you here.

36
00:02:58,286 --> 00:03:00,486
Oh, what? You're forbidding entry?
That's right.

37
00:03:00,646 --> 00:03:02,806
Why am I in the shit here?
I don't understand.

38
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:04,766
I thought you were
having sex with a classmate.

39
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:08,246
You didn't tell me it was a teacher.
I let you use my flat.

40
00:03:08,406 --> 00:03:10,766
Yeah, well, then you told her
to go fuck off.

41
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,926
Wendy!

42
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:17,486
What's going on?

43
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:19,446
Fuzz, get inside now, please.

44
00:03:20,446 --> 00:03:22,726
Oh, come on. Forbidden access?

45
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,646
Well, you went behind my back.

46
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:27,686
Wendy, I didn't know
it was his teacher. I swear.

47
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:29,486
What? You think that's
some kind of defence?

48
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:32,566
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact,
and funnily enough not a bad one.

49
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:34,206
Don't you think
you ought to have known?

50
00:03:34,366 --> 00:03:35,686
What?

51
00:03:35,846 --> 00:03:37,326
Jesus, Cleaver, you're a barrister.

52
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:40,126
You cross-examine people for
a living, yet a 15-year-old boy...

53
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:44,406
I asked him if it was a girl in his class
and he said, yes, it was.

54
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:46,526
Did you ask him what her name was?

55
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:48,006
What difference could that have made?

56
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,206
I don't know the names
of anybody in his class.

57
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:51,686
No, you don't.
Doesn't matter, does it?

58
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:53,526
Doesn't matter what her name is,
what she's like.

59
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:55,006
None of that matters
because your son

60
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,366
is finally becoming a man,
a chip off the old block.

61
00:03:57,526 --> 00:04:00,606
I didn't know she was 28, alright?
I thought she was 15.

62
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:02,966
Well, did you find out if he thought

63
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:05,046
this 15-year-old girl
was ready for intercourse?

64
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:07,206
I mean, did you make sure
he wasn't pressuring her?

65
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:10,446
Wendy, it's Fuzz. What... It's Fuzz!

66
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:12,766
I thought it was
a couple of kids in love.

67
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:15,286
It's a story as old
as mankind itself.

68
00:04:15,446 --> 00:04:19,726
Why do you have to over-analyse
absolutely everything?

69
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:23,366
Cleaver, because
I'm the responsible parent, OK?

70
00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:25,886
And it's not a role
I relish particularly.

71
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:28,766
I'm sick to death of being
the only grown-up in this family.

72
00:04:28,926 --> 00:04:31,006
I'd love to share the load.
I really would.

73
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,806
So if you can convince me
that you can shoulder some of it,

74
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:35,806
come back then.

75
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,726
“Did you have a good day
at the office, darling?”

76
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:43,206
“Yes, I had a lovely day.
And how was your day?”

77
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,166
“Good. Would you like
a cocktail of some description?”

78
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,646
“That'd be marvellous.”

79
00:04:46,806 --> 00:04:48,446
Oh, fuck me.

80
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:18,046
Bronwyn, another beautiful soul
has just taken her first breath.

81
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:22,486
Doctor, your briefcase
has been handed in to the police.

82
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:26,686
Oh, my briefcase. Good, good.
Thank you, Bronwyn.

83
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:29,886
Um, they're here, actually —
the police.

84
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:33,206
They'd like to have a word.

85
00:05:46,406 --> 00:05:48,486
What's going on?

86
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:52,886
They found the DVD.

87
00:05:54,526 --> 00:05:57,846
What do you mean,
“They found the DVD”?

88
00:05:58,006 --> 00:05:59,846
It was in my case.

89
00:06:00,846 --> 00:06:02,286
What?

90
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,806
It was in my briefcase
when it was stolen.

91
00:06:04,966 --> 00:06:07,606
What was it doing in your briefcase,
for God's sake?

92
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,966
lt...

93
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:13,086
I needed to know where it was.

94
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,526
We have a perfectly good
safe at home!

95
00:06:17,686 --> 00:06:22,726
It's not safe.
Bec has the combination.

96
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:28,446
Oh, no. God. Ohh.

97
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:30,966
Colin.
Cleave.

98
00:06:31,126 --> 00:06:33,366
How's it dangling?
To the left, mate.

99
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,446
Good, good.

100
00:06:43,766 --> 00:06:46,246
Come on. Fucking hit him!

101
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:49,766
Come on, get off the ropes!

102
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:53,006
Come on. Get in there!

103
00:06:59,446 --> 00:07:01,606
Come on!
Want a beer?

104
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:03,526
The pope shit in the woods?

105
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:06,286
Manos. How are we?

106
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:09,126
Cleave. Long time no see.

107
00:07:09,286 --> 00:07:11,366
Yeah.

108
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:19,390
http://hiqve.com/

109
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:57,166
Hey! It's only me.

110
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,686
Let me do the talking.

111
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:04,406
OK.

112
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:20,526
So are you gonna be charged?

113
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:23,166
It looks like it, yeah.

114
00:08:23,326 --> 00:08:26,126
Can I see it?
What?

115
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:29,686
The DVD.
What? No!

116
00:08:29,846 --> 00:08:34,606
You must promise us
you will never watch that DVD.

117
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,846
Well, they'll show it
if there's a trial, won't they?

118
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:40,206
If there's a trial,
I don't want you to be there,

119
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:42,406
for your sake as much as ours.

120
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:45,246
Please, sweetheart,
it cannot do you any good.

121
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:48,046
I mean, you mustn't let
this silliness distract you.

122
00:08:48,206 --> 00:08:49,526
You've got exams coming up.

123
00:08:49,686 --> 00:08:51,246
Distract me?

124
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,406
Mum, you can't possibly think
that this is just a distraction.

125
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:56,446
I'm so sorry, darling.

126
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:00,166
Ironically, my first exam's crim.

127
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:03,886
Sweetheart.

128
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:09,166
When in doubt,
stick your left out. That's my boy!

129
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:13,366
When in doubt,
stick your left out. That's my boy!

130
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:15,006
Come on, you joke!

131
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,966
Oh, you're a joke.
You're a fool to your family.

132
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:20,726
Col, double it.
Come on, mate. He's getting smashed.

133
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:23,126
Double it.
I'm good for it. Double it.

134
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:24,966
I'll have to ring Mick.

135
00:09:25,126 --> 00:09:27,246
Ring him, fast.
Alright.

136
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:30,046
Come on. Come on, you little poof!

137
00:09:30,206 --> 00:09:32,406
Yeah! That's the way. That's my boy.

138
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:35,286
Come on, you little prick. Come on!

139
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:39,886
Ohh!

140
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:44,286
I don't understand, Cleave.
You said you had the cash.

141
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:45,926
Mick's gonna fucking flip out.

142
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,726
Come on, Col. Let's get on with it.

143
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:49,526
Life's too short
to wait for a beating.

144
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:51,486
Justice delayed is justice denied

145
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:53,646
and if justice is denied,
the whole system crashes,

146
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:55,326
the walls come tumbling down, mate.

147
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:57,326
Just... Ooh!

148
00:10:09,126 --> 00:10:10,966
Will this do?

149
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:12,446
Piss off.

150
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:14,486
Come on, mate.
Look at this. He was a pro.

151
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:16,766
He did a much better job
than you could ever do

152
00:10:16,926 --> 00:10:18,246
and it didn't cost you a cent.

153
00:10:18,406 --> 00:10:19,526
Go home.

154
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:23,366
Come on, mate. Are we square?
Look, I've taken my beating.

155
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:25,446
Come on. Barney, are we quits?

156
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:28,766
Come on, mate. Are we cool? Huh?

157
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:30,566
Ohh.

158
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:34,446
Thank you for coming.

159
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:36,606
You're welcome.

160
00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:40,486
Can I ask why you came?

161
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:43,446
One good deed, you know?

162
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:46,286
When did I ever do a good deed?

163
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:50,086
Rumour has it
there have been one or two.

164
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:55,166
Does Harry-sorry-David
know you're here?

165
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,686
No.

166
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:26,166
I slept with my best friend's wife.

167
00:11:26,326 --> 00:11:28,366
I know.

168
00:11:30,846 --> 00:11:32,646
How do you know?

169
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:36,366
How do you think?

170
00:11:49,766 --> 00:11:51,086
Yeah.

171
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:53,846
Hi. It's me.
Who's ‘me'?

172
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,366
- Scarlet.
- Oh.

173
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:58,086
Welcome.

174
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:08,726
Jesus, Cleave!

175
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:10,366
What's going on?

176
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:12,366
Barney's kicked me out.

177
00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:15,926
He said he couldn't
bear to look at me anymore,

178
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:19,686
that I was the one who fucked up
so I was the one who had to leave.

179
00:12:19,846 --> 00:12:21,806
I had to leave my babies.

180
00:12:22,806 --> 00:12:25,126
Listen, Red, I don't have any tea.

181
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,686
Um, this could be
some sort of a yeast extract.

182
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:31,006
Uh, I've actually gotta fly.
I've gotta get to work.

183
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,486
That's OK. I've cleared my day
so I'll just stay here, if that's OK.

184
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:37,046
Sure.

185
00:12:43,566 --> 00:12:45,166
We're down here, blossom.

186
00:12:45,326 --> 00:12:47,486
Lincoln's running five minutes late.

187
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:49,806
Right. Who's Lincoln?

188
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:53,046
He's briefing you
on the Chandler thing.

189
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,766
Don't tell me you walked
into another cupboard door.

190
00:12:55,926 --> 00:12:59,406
Cupboard doors are the natural
enemy of the sw...swine.

191
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:03,166
Cleave, you alright?

192
00:13:04,526 --> 00:13:08,766
Hay fever. Is ‘Lincoln'
this guy's first name or his surname?

193
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:14,006
Uh...the correspondence
is still unclear. It could be both.

194
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:17,566
Let me just... Hang on.
It's a DVD, yeah?

195
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:21,006
Yeah, I've hit ‘DVD'. I've hit ‘AV',
I've hit ‘DVD', I've hit ‘Pr List'.

196
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:22,806
Good, good. Don't hit it.

197
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:24,886
NICOLE! What? It...

198
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:35,406
Ohh,
Jesus Christ, on a bicycle!

199
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,846
You are fucking kidding me.

200
00:13:39,006 --> 00:13:42,206
Oh-ho-ho-ho! No. Ohh.

201
00:13:42,366 --> 00:13:47,846
Oh, my sweet sainted aunt.

202
00:13:49,526 --> 00:13:51,726
Have you got a copy
of the record of interview?

203
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:56,806
I was sure I had it with me.
[...must have left it at the office.

204
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:58,526
Well, it's sort of important,
don't you think?

205
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:00,046
You might want to get your secretary

206
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,286
to fax it through
or email it or something.

207
00:14:02,446 --> 00:14:05,366
Uh, no. She's, um...
she's not in today.

208
00:14:05,526 --> 00:14:08,726
She found out her sister
has a...a lump.

209
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:10,406
I don't mean to sound
uncaring or anything...

210
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:11,886
Hold on a minute. Yes, I do.

211
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:17,326
Have you at least read
the record of interview? Lincoln?

212
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:20,206
Mr Lincoln?
Yes. Yeah. I've read it.

213
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:21,726
Yes?
Like...yeah.

214
00:14:22,886 --> 00:14:26,286
Well, he...
At first what he initially...

215
00:14:26,446 --> 00:14:29,686
He initially denies
that it is he in the room.

216
00:14:29,846 --> 00:14:32,926
Oh, itis he. It is he. I know he.

217
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:37,286
He delivered my son
and about 12,000 of my godchildren.

218
00:14:37,446 --> 00:14:40,806
Oh, well, perhaps that's why
he requested you as counsel.

219
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:46,326
He then goes on to tell the police
that, yes, he was in the room,

220
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,286
but that the room was in Canada...

221
00:14:49,326 --> 00:14:53,526
..and therefore he's committed
no crime under New South Wales law.

222
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:55,366
Canada.

223
00:14:56,366 --> 00:14:59,206
What the hell is he talking about?

224
00:15:01,406 --> 00:15:03,646
I could see the Opera House
out of your window, Bruce.

225
00:15:03,806 --> 00:15:05,126
It's as clear as day.

226
00:15:05,286 --> 00:15:07,646
There's a copy of the ‘Sydney
Morning Herald' on your coffee table.

227
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,966
I panicked.
You didn't do yourself any favours.

228
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:12,726
Listen, Cleaver. Cleaver.

229
00:15:12,886 --> 00:15:16,126
All Jan and I care about is Bec,
you understand?

230
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:18,086
Whatever happens to me,

231
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:21,206
she'd be lost without Jan
and Jan would be lost without her.

232
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:24,166
Jan hasn't been charged yet.
And it has to stay that way.

233
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:26,726
Well, what exactly have you told Bec?

234
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:31,126
Well, uh, I was with a prostitute
and I'd been taking drugs.

235
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:34,806
Mate, look, I'm usually
not one to be defeatist,

236
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:39,646
but it's only a matter of time
before everyone knows it was Jan.

237
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,766
You've seen the DVD.
We were masked!

238
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:46,246
Bruce, it's your house and
your mask falls off YOUR face

239
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:49,046
for eight and a half
exceptionally visible seconds.

240
00:15:49,206 --> 00:15:53,486
I know that, but Jan's... The other
woman's mask didn't come off.

241
00:15:53,646 --> 00:15:55,886
Let's...let's forget about
the mask for a minute, OK?

242
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:57,446
Forget about the mask.

243
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:59,246
You and the “other woman”

244
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:01,566
were having a three-way
with the family dog, alright?

245
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:03,966
Masks are the least
of my problem at the moment.

246
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:06,886
Bruce, drinks.

247
00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:12,966
The prosecution's gonna
want to see receipts, Bruce.

248
00:16:13,126 --> 00:16:16,686
- They will want the...
- the hooker.

249
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:19,846
I paid cash. I don't know her name.
I picked her up off the street.

250
00:16:20,006 --> 00:16:21,726
What, you just happened
to pick up a hooker

251
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:23,606
who was happy to take it
from a rottweiler?

252
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,686
Mate, it doesn't work that way.
Believe me.

253
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:27,246
That is a job for a specialist.

254
00:16:27,406 --> 00:16:30,006
I picked her up off the street,
we took a combination of drugs...

255
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,046
Bruce.

256
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:32,526
..and things got out of hand.

257
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:34,046
It wasn't Jan!

258
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:38,486
Then why is she
standing by her man, huh? Why?

259
00:16:38,646 --> 00:16:41,886
Why wasn't she on the first
Greyhound out of town

260
00:16:42,046 --> 00:16:43,406
when this thing came to light?

261
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:45,606
Please, Cleaver.

262
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:49,326
The woman I was with
was a prostitute.

263
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:51,566
It wasn't Jan.

264
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:57,286
Bless you.

265
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:59,086
Are you alright?

266
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:02,126
Am I alright?

267
00:17:02,286 --> 00:17:02,326
And finally I want to assure you

268
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:03,806
And finally I want to assure you

269
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:06,926
that if I am selected as
Labor Party candidate for this seat,

270
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:08,926
it will be my honour
to fight for you.

271
00:17:09,086 --> 00:17:10,686
And as some of you may be aware,

272
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:12,846
I am not one
to back away from a fight.

273
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:14,606
Thank you.

274
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,046
Good.

275
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,766
So Sussex Street wants to parachute
in another celebrity candidate,

276
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:28,046
someone who's their own man,
someone whose vote they can control.

277
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:31,286
Mr Potter has spent
his working life as a tax lawyer.

278
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:34,006
I spent my working life
as an electrician.

279
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,846
Mr Potter spends his time
helping the big end of town

280
00:17:37,006 --> 00:17:38,446
evade their responsibilities.

281
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:42,286
I've had 15 years experience
on the Leichhardt council,

282
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:43,766
serving the community.

283
00:17:43,926 --> 00:17:47,086
If anyone can fend off
the Greens at the next poll,

284
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:49,646
it's a local who knows the issues,

285
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:54,606
not some Macquarie Street blow-in
backed by the machine.

286
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:57,326
We might have to go
a bit retail on this one, mate.

287
00:17:57,486 --> 00:17:59,766
The electrician will trump
the tax lawyer every time.

288
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:01,566
I thought it was
going to be uncontested.

289
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:04,046
What can we say?
The Labor Party's a democracy.

290
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:06,646
Well, at least it has
to be seen to be one

291
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:08,326
until an actual decision
needs to be made.

292
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:12,206
So what? Jack Fulton's
a threat? NOT a threat?

293
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:15,406
Oh, look, I don't think
we need to worry about him.

294
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:18,286
He's just a hardworking local who's
worked his way up through the ranks.

295
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:19,766
He hasn't got a chance.

296
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:22,166
Still...
Still?

297
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:24,486
Well, Jack's a tough customer.

298
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:28,286
25 years, he's been an active member
of the Electrical Trades Union.

299
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:31,006
I mean, you're not even
a union member, are you, Dave?

300
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,566
He's been selling raffle tickets

301
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:35,246
at every branch meeting
since Gough Whitlam was a boy.

302
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:41,406
Do you know what they say in
the Boy Scouts, Davo? “Be prepared.”

303
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,406
Hi.
Hey.

304
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,286
I got us some chicken from Deluca.

305
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:04,246
Was it a little wrinkled?

306
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:07,606
On my return,
I went to turn on your oven,

307
00:19:07,766 --> 00:19:09,366
which, of course,
was a fool's errand

308
00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:15,086
because on opening it, I did
discover it is in fact a library.

309
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:16,926
Well, that may well be the case, Red,

310
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:19,726
but I won't have a word
said against this iron.

311
00:19:19,886 --> 00:19:23,406
This iron has heated up many a fine
casserole for me over the years.

312
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:25,646
How do you live like this?

313
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:28,046
By setting it on ‘Cottons'.

314
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:29,846
I'll be a sec.

315
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:33,246
You want some wine?
Please.

316
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:39,726
Didn't you move in here
after Wendy kicked you out?

317
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:42,686
Uh...yeah.

318
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:45,566
Cleave, that was 11 years ago.

319
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,446
Really?

320
00:19:47,606 --> 00:19:49,166
I thought this was
just a temporary thing

321
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:51,446
until you found your own place.

322
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,486
Itis.

323
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:03,726
Well, here's to long nights
on slow trains.

324
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:05,406
Cheers.

325
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:13,486
Speaking of moving in,
is that what this is, Red?

326
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:17,086
Um, ‘cause, you know, I've been
thinking. There's your sister.

327
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:20,486
Yeah, well,
Alex's parents are in town.

328
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:25,006
Oh, yeah. What about a hotel?
Or a motel?

329
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,446
Or a YWCA or a bus shelter
or a park bench?

330
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:30,246
Anywhere but here.

331
00:20:30,406 --> 00:20:32,606
Come on, Red.
What if Barney finds out?

332
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:35,766
He dropped me here.

333
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:38,366
Red, Red, Red.

334
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:40,406
Don't!

335
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:46,166
This had to happen for a reason.

336
00:20:46,326 --> 00:20:50,006
You and I, that night.
It had to be for a reason.

337
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,606
It did happen for a reason —

338
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:54,046
because we were drunk
and miserable and lonely.

339
00:20:54,206 --> 00:20:55,566
Oh, I won't have that.

340
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:59,646
I won't... won't lose
my house and my family

341
00:20:59,806 --> 00:21:02,126
just for one miserable drunken fuck.

342
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:04,126
It's too easy. It's way too easy.

343
00:21:07,006 --> 00:21:09,326
Where the fuck is my bag?

344
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:12,886
You know what?

345
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:14,646
Even after Barney and I
were married,

346
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,766
you still kept flirting with me,

347
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:18,966
you still used to give me that look.

348
00:21:19,126 --> 00:21:20,886
What look?
You know the look!

349
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,886
What are you talking about, Red?
I only have one look with women.

350
00:21:25,046 --> 00:21:27,406
Yeah, that's your problem.

351
00:21:28,406 --> 00:21:30,566
Red, come on, come on. Red, Red.

352
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:33,686
Red, it's OK.

353
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:36,286
Come on. It's OK.

354
00:21:36,446 --> 00:21:40,446
Come on. Drop them.
You don't have to leave.

355
00:21:42,086 --> 00:21:44,486
You don't have to leave.

356
00:21:44,646 --> 00:21:46,086
So I'm guessing “Be prepared”

357
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:50,686
means we better start to think about
finding some dirt on Jack Fulton.

358
00:21:50,846 --> 00:21:52,246
No, in the ALP,

359
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:55,566
“Be prepared” means “We already
have some dirt on Jack Fulton.”

360
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:58,086
What?

361
00:21:58,246 --> 00:21:59,886
23 seconds into
your political career

362
00:22:00,046 --> 00:22:02,566
and you're already
going Karl Rove on me.

363
00:22:02,726 --> 00:22:05,366
I thought you were meant to be
one of those rare honest ones.

364
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:09,246
Oh, come on. Since when does
“Be prepared” mean “Be dishonest?”

365
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:11,086
You know what Joe and Gav are like.

366
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,846
Yeah, Joe and Gav
live in the real world.

367
00:22:14,006 --> 00:22:15,326
They've been doing this for years.

368
00:22:15,486 --> 00:22:16,886
That is such bullshit.

369
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:20,526
This is your campaign, David,
your name, your responsibility.

370
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:22,006
Hold on.

371
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:25,486
Do you honestly believe
that Jack isn't out there right now

372
00:22:25,646 --> 00:22:27,046
trying to dig up dirt on me?

373
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:28,526
It's the way of the world.

374
00:22:28,686 --> 00:22:31,766
And you want to be
a part of this world?

375
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:36,446
Look, I've been given
an opportunity, alright?

376
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:39,366
It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

377
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,046
Now, Joe's got it all figured out —

378
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:43,726
a couple of terms in
Macquarie Street and then Canberra.

379
00:22:43,886 --> 00:22:45,966
Who knows what then, OK?

380
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:49,006
I can do this. Joe thinks
I can do it with him backing me.

381
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,406
The higher you get,
the deeper they'll dig.

382
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:53,646
Well, that's the price you pay.

383
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:55,726
I'm not prepared to pay it.

384
00:22:55,886 --> 00:22:57,366
I didn't mean you.

385
00:22:57,526 --> 00:23:00,086
But it will mean me, won't it?

386
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:02,966
Well, who cares? I mean, Jesus,
what have you got to hide?

387
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:04,846
That's not the point.
Well, what is the point?

388
00:23:05,006 --> 00:23:07,766
I'm a very private person.

389
00:23:07,926 --> 00:23:10,326
You said you were OK
with me going into politics.

390
00:23:10,486 --> 00:23:12,886
Yeah, well, I'm beginning
to have second thoughts.

391
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:15,166
Well, it's a bit bloody late.

392
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:39,886
Can I come up?

393
00:23:40,046 --> 00:23:43,486
Uh, you know those lines
in the sand you keep drawing...

394
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:45,646
I've left David.

395
00:23:45,806 --> 00:23:47,366
Really?

396
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,726
I think so, yeah.

397
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,486
Right, and you've got
nowhere else to go?

398
00:23:52,646 --> 00:23:57,766
I've got plenty of places to go.
It's just I wanted to see YOU.

399
00:23:59,126 --> 00:24:00,486
Oh.

400
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:02,006
Have you got company?

401
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:06,126
Yeah. Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.

402
00:24:06,286 --> 00:24:08,806
Shit. Sorry.

403
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:11,366
Silly idea. Sorry.

404
00:24:12,486 --> 00:24:14,606
Missy!

405
00:24:15,646 --> 00:24:17,566
Come back, come back. It's alright.

406
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:22,046
She's just a mate. Come on.
We'll just have to be quiet.

407
00:24:24,886 --> 00:24:27,686
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

408
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:39,646
Uh, you two have met,
I seem to recall.

409
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:42,446
Hi.

410
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,486
What do you mean,
David's too good for you?

411
00:24:44,646 --> 00:24:45,966
Just that.

412
00:24:46,126 --> 00:24:47,846
Yes, just that, Red, alright?

413
00:24:48,006 --> 00:24:50,686
It's a thing. I've read about this.
It's documented.

414
00:24:50,846 --> 00:24:52,246
It's a kind of goodness imbalance

415
00:24:52,406 --> 00:24:53,766
that happens in
a lot of relationships

416
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,246
and more often than not it's fatal.

417
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:56,926
Oh, what rot!

418
00:24:57,086 --> 00:24:59,286
Listen to me. David's
an exceptionally good guy.

419
00:24:59,446 --> 00:25:02,286
I mean, how can that be a negative?

420
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:06,046
Oh, it's getting late.
I'm talking to Melissa.

421
00:25:07,046 --> 00:25:09,086
Are you... What?
Are you unfulfilled?

422
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:11,886
I mean...
No, no, the sex is great.

423
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:15,806
Red, you're looking really tired.
It's been a big day for all of us.

424
00:25:15,966 --> 00:25:19,526
So, to summarise,
David is a good guy.

425
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:24,006
He's great-looking,
he's smart, terrific in bed...

426
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:27,886
God, are you out of your mind?

427
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:33,406
What? What is it?

428
00:25:36,646 --> 00:25:40,566
I used to be a prostitute, Scarlet.

429
00:25:42,766 --> 00:25:44,326
Oh.

430
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,886
Melissa?

431
00:25:48,886 --> 00:25:51,686
As in...this is Missy?

432
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:55,366
Small world, huh?

433
00:26:06,486 --> 00:26:09,646
What the hell, Jan?
What is he doing in here?

434
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:10,806
Sit!

435
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:14,006
Oh, he was so lonely outside.

436
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:19,606
We talked about this.
We agreed. We promised we wouldn't.

437
00:26:19,766 --> 00:26:23,086
He was crying.
He doesn't understand.

438
00:26:23,246 --> 00:26:25,006
Oh, come on, darling.
Don't be silly now.

439
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,886
Silly? This isn't silliness, Jan.

440
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:31,566
This is our life.

441
00:26:32,686 --> 00:26:35,646
Everything we have has been
built on my good name

442
00:26:35,806 --> 00:26:37,446
which has been more
than a little sullied

443
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:40,766
by having been caught
buggering the family hound!

444
00:26:43,486 --> 00:26:46,486
Darling, you can't go on like this.

445
00:26:47,486 --> 00:26:48,806
Like what?

446
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:50,926
What's happening to us is real.

447
00:26:51,086 --> 00:26:53,606
It's not a minor setback.
It's not silly.

448
00:26:53,766 --> 00:26:59,406
You can't keep believing that
everything will be the same.

449
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:05,166
Bruce?

450
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:07,206
Darling.

451
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:15,086
How did we get to this place?

452
00:27:17,246 --> 00:27:19,366
I was a Rhodes scholar.

453
00:27:19,526 --> 00:27:24,206
I brought thousands of children
into the world.

454
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:27,046
I believe I've been
a good and loving father.

455
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:29,766
And yet for the rest of my life,

456
00:27:29,926 --> 00:27:34,246
I will be known for one thing
and one thing only.

457
00:27:34,406 --> 00:27:36,566
No, I won't have that.

458
00:27:36,726 --> 00:27:39,966
You're still a marvel of a man.

459
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,446
Whatever they say,

460
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:47,766
you are still the kindest,
the most decent and loving man.

461
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:51,926
l, um...

462
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:54,806
..I think I'm going to tell Cleaver
to change my plea to guilty.

463
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:56,286
What?!

464
00:27:56,446 --> 00:27:59,126
A trial will only make things
worse for you and Bec. It will.

465
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:01,046
Don't be ridiculous!

466
00:28:01,206 --> 00:28:03,366
You've done nothing wrong.

467
00:28:03,526 --> 00:28:06,166
We are going to fight this thing
and you're going to be acquitted.

468
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:09,246
Now come back to bed.
You're being silly. Come on.

469
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:15,366
Even if I am acquitted, you...

470
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:16,846
..you have to realise

471
00:28:17,006 --> 00:28:22,806
that our lives as we know them
are over, my love.

472
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:24,846
It's over.

473
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:27,166
Ohh!

474
00:28:31,366 --> 00:28:34,086
Oh, fuck!

475
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:49,366
What the f...

476
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,406
- Yeah.
- It's me.

477
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:54,806
Is Fuzz there?

478
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,806
He hasn't texted or anything?

479
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:03,006
No. I thought I was
persona non grata.

480
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:04,966
God. He's with her. He has to be.

481
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:06,606
Well, then we know he's safe.

482
00:29:06,766 --> 00:29:08,406
Not with that woman, he isn't.

483
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:11,046
Well, why don't you go round
to her place and find out?

484
00:29:11,206 --> 00:29:13,606
I did. She must have moved.

485
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:16,406
OK, here. Have a drop of this.
You look like a nervous wreck.

486
00:29:16,566 --> 00:29:18,406
Oh, I haven't slept for 36 hours.

487
00:29:18,566 --> 00:29:20,126
Jesus!

488
00:29:21,446 --> 00:29:25,806
Mm, she...she's a succubus.
I thought she was born in July.

489
00:29:25,966 --> 00:29:28,686
Don't you dare be glib about this.
I'm not being glib.

490
00:29:28,846 --> 00:29:31,246
You know, we tried being heavy
and that didn't work.

491
00:29:31,406 --> 00:29:32,726
He's still a boy.

492
00:29:32,886 --> 00:29:34,526
We're gonna have
to change tack at some stage.

493
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:36,326
He's gonna be 16
in a couple of weeks.

494
00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:38,686
I don't care what the law says,
Cleaver. He's our son!

495
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:41,566
At some point, he's going to need
to see some moral leadership.

496
00:29:41,726 --> 00:29:43,246
Yeah.

497
00:29:44,646 --> 00:29:46,526
Who is in your bed with Scarlet?

498
00:29:47,526 --> 00:29:51,566
Uh, who is... Oh, yeah,
that would be my friend Missy.

499
00:29:51,726 --> 00:29:55,126
I may have mentioned her
a couple of times.

500
00:29:55,286 --> 00:29:56,606
Oh.

501
00:29:56,766 --> 00:30:00,486
Hello, mate. This is your
sometime-father here.

502
00:30:00,646 --> 00:30:02,966
Um, your mother and I are
a little worried about you.

503
00:30:03,126 --> 00:30:04,486
We assume you're with Fiona.

504
00:30:04,646 --> 00:30:06,966
Could you at least
confirm that's the case.

505
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:09,086
We don't want to cause a fuss.

506
00:30:09,246 --> 00:30:13,566
I may deserve to suffer, mate,
but your mum doesn't, OK?

507
00:30:13,726 --> 00:30:15,246
See ya.

508
00:30:16,726 --> 00:30:19,046
Yeah.
So what's the story with these two?

509
00:30:19,206 --> 00:30:21,206
Oh, well, the presidential suite
at the Intercontinental

510
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:22,726
was taken by Lady Gaga so...

511
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:29,126
..we just had to make do.

512
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:32,366
I'm not, uh...I'm not doing the deed.

513
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:34,726
I know. I can tell.
That's what's so funny.

514
00:30:34,886 --> 00:30:37,126
Good.

515
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:41,726
Oh, yes, yes. He's fine.
He's with her.

516
00:30:41,886 --> 00:30:43,846
He's gonna see you in the morning.

517
00:30:47,286 --> 00:30:51,366
Would you like a bit more?
Mm, I shouldn't.

518
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:30,046
Are you kidding?
I was desperate to go.

519
00:31:30,206 --> 00:31:32,686
I would have winged myself to
Melbourne to meet Michael Hutchence.

520
00:31:32,846 --> 00:31:34,166
Cleaver didn't want to go.

521
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,406
He cannot stand the idea
of being in a room

522
00:31:36,566 --> 00:31:38,886
and not being the man with
the highest testosterone level.

523
00:31:39,046 --> 00:31:41,646
Barney and I, we took him
to see the Dalai Lama once

524
00:31:41,806 --> 00:31:45,166
and we got invited backstage
and Cleaver just stood in the corner.

525
00:31:45,326 --> 00:31:47,366
He couldn't even
go near the Dalai Lama.

526
00:31:47,526 --> 00:31:50,046
Oh, and here he is.

527
00:31:50,206 --> 00:31:53,286
- Morning.
- Morning.

528
00:31:54,286 --> 00:31:56,566
I was thinking ‘Witches of Eastwick'
for a minute,

529
00:31:56,726 --> 00:31:59,126
but then I realised
it was a bit more ‘Macbeth'.

530
00:31:59,286 --> 00:32:02,086
Hi, Cleave!
Beasts, how are we all, huh?

531
00:32:02,246 --> 00:32:04,166
Barney's got an abscess
in one of his teeth

532
00:32:04,326 --> 00:32:06,006
so he had to drop them over.

533
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:09,206
So I see. Ohh! Oh, yes. Good.

534
00:32:09,366 --> 00:32:13,766
Well, the more, the merrier, I say.

535
00:32:23,966 --> 00:32:27,286
I gotta pee, Cleave.
What's that under your nose?

536
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,726
Oh, well, I was trying
to brush my teeth

537
00:32:30,886 --> 00:32:33,606
and I missed my mouth and hit
my nose, and it's all your fault!

538
00:32:33,766 --> 00:32:35,086
It's your fault!

539
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:36,726
It's your fault, you little pest.

540
00:32:41,766 --> 00:32:45,406
Oh, Alice, where's the rosemary
hiding, sweetheart?

541
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:48,286
Um, I'll... just...

542
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,966
Branch warfare has
broken out today in the ALP...

543
00:33:03,126 --> 00:33:07,566
Counting really good, Max.
Really good.

544
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:09,886
Hello.
Hey.

545
00:33:10,046 --> 00:33:12,966
..an affair with Greens MP
Lenore Harris.

546
00:33:13,126 --> 00:33:17,086
Mr Fulton and Miss Harris have both
been referred to ICAC.

547
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:19,286
for misusing council resources...

548
00:33:19,446 --> 00:33:22,206
One day? You couldn't
even wait one lousy day?

549
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:23,686
Where are you?

550
00:33:23,846 --> 00:33:25,806
The poor bastard
didn't even have a chance!

551
00:33:25,966 --> 00:33:27,286
I have been worried blind.

552
00:33:27,446 --> 00:33:29,326
Come home, please.
Hold on a minute.

553
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:34,886
In 2007, Lenore Harris and I had
an affair lasting several months...

554
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,366
Why are the children still here?

555
00:33:37,526 --> 00:33:39,766
Barney's still not very well,
apparently.

556
00:33:41,406 --> 00:33:42,726
I need some time to think.

557
00:33:47,486 --> 00:33:50,206
I betrayed my wife and family
at the worst possible...

558
00:33:50,366 --> 00:33:53,286
- What's the time, Mr Wolf?
- Go, go, go, go, go!

559
00:34:08,086 --> 00:34:09,486
Boy Wonder?

560
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:13,246
What's the deal?

561
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:19,846
[... don't know, Cleave.
I just don't see how it can work.

562
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:24,806
Oh, that poor man!

563
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:26,166
Who?

564
00:34:26,326 --> 00:34:28,126
Jack Fulton.

565
00:34:28,286 --> 00:34:30,726
I mean, he just made one mistake

566
00:34:30,886 --> 00:34:35,086
and courtesy of the party machine,
his past came back to haunt him.

567
00:34:39,486 --> 00:34:43,486
Please don't mistake this for
me being compassionate or anything,

568
00:34:43,646 --> 00:34:48,846
but you really need to either
tell David the truth

569
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:50,726
or end it.

570
00:34:50,886 --> 00:34:52,206
I know.

571
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:55,686
If you think you can keep a secret in
this town, you're out of your mind.

572
00:34:56,686 --> 00:35:00,486
But, look, if you need a distraction,
I could use a hand at the moment.

573
00:35:00,646 --> 00:35:01,966
I've got this doggy case on.

574
00:35:02,126 --> 00:35:04,406
The solicitor is a complete mutt

575
00:35:04,566 --> 00:35:08,886
and I need a good retriever
I can rely on.

576
00:35:10,286 --> 00:35:11,846
Oh, my God.

577
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:14,926
Oh! Oh, my... Oh, God!

578
00:35:15,086 --> 00:35:17,446
I thought you'd seen everything
and done everything.

579
00:35:17,606 --> 00:35:19,606
Oh, make it stop!

580
00:35:19,766 --> 00:35:21,526
It's amazing, you know —

581
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:24,286
when I first saw it,
I was reaching for a bucket too,

582
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:28,606
but after about 50 times, it's a bit
like watching ‘Itchy and Scratchy'.

583
00:35:28,766 --> 00:35:30,726
Who are these people?

584
00:35:30,886 --> 00:35:33,486
Well, that's Dr Bruce Chandler...

585
00:35:34,726 --> 00:35:38,686
Actually, do you know a girl
called Bec Chandler?

586
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:41,806
She'd be about a year
ahead of you at law school.

587
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:44,126
So?

588
00:35:44,286 --> 00:35:46,286
That's her dad.

589
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:11,846
Thanks. It'll only
be for a few nights.

590
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:13,486
Yeah. I'll just get the kids settled.

591
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:51,166
Jules is going away so I can have
her place while I work things out!

592
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:54,206
Oh.

593
00:36:56,526 --> 00:36:59,046
Don't you want to stay here?

594
00:37:00,606 --> 00:37:03,766
I don't know what I want
at the moment, Cleave.

595
00:37:22,886 --> 00:37:24,886
Hey, Bec! Come on,
give us a smile, will ya?

596
00:37:25,046 --> 00:37:27,286
That's it. Give us a smile!
Come on, Bec. Come on.

597
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:29,406
Woof, woof, woof, woof!
Bark for me, baby.

598
00:37:29,566 --> 00:37:31,486
Bark for me, baby. That's it.

599
00:37:31,646 --> 00:37:33,526
Come on, come on...
Hey, do you mind?

600
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:35,286
Oh, I'm so sorry!

601
00:37:35,446 --> 00:37:37,686
Ohh! Fuck.

602
00:37:39,726 --> 00:37:41,046
Thanks.

603
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:43,126
It was my pleasure. Believe me.

604
00:37:44,126 --> 00:37:46,566
Do you know why
he was taking those pictures?

605
00:37:46,726 --> 00:37:48,726
‘Cause of your father?

606
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,286
You know, it's not that unusual, Bec.

607
00:37:53,446 --> 00:37:54,926
What isn't?

608
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:58,446
There are lots of good people
into weird shit.

609
00:37:58,606 --> 00:37:59,926
What?

610
00:38:00,086 --> 00:38:02,046
Everyone's into something, Bec.

611
00:38:02,206 --> 00:38:05,886
Tits, undies, hair, shoes,

612
00:38:06,046 --> 00:38:08,686
back, front, black, white,

613
00:38:08,846 --> 00:38:11,886
pure, dirty, leather, rubber, SMBD.

614
00:38:12,046 --> 00:38:13,926
Trust me. They've run out of letters.

615
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:15,446
What are you saying?

616
00:38:15,606 --> 00:38:18,566
I'm saying that sex
can be totally separate

617
00:38:18,726 --> 00:38:22,686
to the rest of someone's personality,
particularly men.

618
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:26,086
You can be a good employee,
a wonderful parent,

619
00:38:26,246 --> 00:38:28,366
you can devote your life
to those less fortunate...

620
00:38:28,526 --> 00:38:31,046
You can be any and all
of these things, Bec,

621
00:38:31,206 --> 00:38:33,366
and still have a dirty little secret,

622
00:38:33,526 --> 00:38:37,406
which for all practical purposes has
no bearing on the rest of your life,

623
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:41,846
so long as that dirty little secret
is adult and consensual

624
00:38:42,006 --> 00:38:45,766
and nobody gets hurt
more than they really want to be.

625
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:55,246
By the way, I'm working
for your father.

626
00:39:06,766 --> 00:39:08,726
I'll just be another 10, darling.

627
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:11,646
Dad.

628
00:39:11,806 --> 00:39:13,486
Oh, sweetheart.

629
00:39:13,646 --> 00:39:16,366
Can you explain it to me?

630
00:39:18,726 --> 00:39:20,966
What possible explanation
could I give

631
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:24,126
that would be satisfactory
to you, really?

632
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:27,486
OK.

633
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:31,006
Why was Mum so quick to forgive you?

634
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:33,126
Well, she's a...

635
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:36,566
..she's a very forgiving person,
your mum.

636
00:39:36,726 --> 00:39:38,046
Are you protecting her?

637
00:39:38,206 --> 00:39:40,446
Don't be absurd. Of course not.

638
00:39:40,606 --> 00:39:42,646
How could you possibly believe
that Mum would be involved...

639
00:39:42,806 --> 00:39:45,286
I don't know what
to believe anymore, Dad.

640
00:39:45,446 --> 00:39:47,086
Oh, darling.

641
00:40:02,406 --> 00:40:04,246
Arggh!

642
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:08,086
So, Dr D'Antonio, we've heard
a lot from the prosecution

643
00:40:08,246 --> 00:40:10,846
about the dog Felix's lack of ability

644
00:40:11,006 --> 00:40:15,406
to consent to the acts that were
recorded in exhibit A-1.

645
00:40:15,566 --> 00:40:18,726
As a professor of animal
behavioural psychology,

646
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:21,166
what would you say
are the traditional signs

647
00:40:21,326 --> 00:40:24,966
that a male rottweiler is up for sex?

648
00:40:25,126 --> 00:40:30,286
Um, well, the classical signs
are an erection, obviously,

649
00:40:30,446 --> 00:40:32,806
panting, salivating, wagging tail.

650
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:34,286
I see.

651
00:40:34,446 --> 00:40:36,926
But as I wrote in ‘Nature', June 2006,

652
00:40:37,086 --> 00:40:40,406
despite the fact that consent is not
an issue that crosses a dog's mind,

653
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:41,966
it should not be taken for granted

654
00:40:42,126 --> 00:40:45,326
that we humans therefore
are free to do as we please.

655
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:46,846
There is a moral dimension.

656
00:40:47,006 --> 00:40:49,806
A moral dimension?
Certainly.

657
00:40:49,966 --> 00:40:51,606
We abhor paedophiles.

658
00:40:51,766 --> 00:40:54,406
In those cases, consent
is not an issue either.

659
00:40:54,566 --> 00:40:57,566
Consent for human beings
is not an issue up to the age of 16

660
00:40:57,726 --> 00:41:01,606
because the law says
the consent must be informed.

661
00:41:01,766 --> 00:41:04,086
Jesus, did you really write that?

662
00:41:04,246 --> 00:41:06,246
Oh, no.

663
00:41:07,246 --> 00:41:09,846
Oh, she's gonna
compare him to a paedophile.

664
00:41:10,006 --> 00:41:11,326
Almost certainly.

665
00:41:11,486 --> 00:41:14,606
She's made the comparison in
at least six articles I could find.

666
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:16,166
Magic fucking word.

667
00:41:16,326 --> 00:41:17,646
You want a conviction,

668
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:21,246
throw the word ‘paedophile'
in front of a jury in any context.

669
00:41:21,406 --> 00:41:24,566
God. She got any religious
affiliations or anything?

670
00:41:24,726 --> 00:41:26,246
She goes to church.

671
00:41:26,406 --> 00:41:30,326
Right, but no sort of nut bag thing
we can throw at the old bitch?

672
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:31,886
“Old bitch”?

673
00:41:32,046 --> 00:41:37,566
She's 35 and this is the photo from
the dust jacket of her latest book.

674
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:40,646
Ooh, hello.

675
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:43,646
I don't want to cross-examine her.
I want her phone number.

676
00:41:45,286 --> 00:41:47,046
If I were the prosecution,

677
00:41:47,206 --> 00:41:51,486
I would just hand out
sick bags to the jury

678
00:41:51,646 --> 00:41:53,446
and make them watch that DVD,

679
00:41:53,606 --> 00:41:56,926
get them worked up,
get them scared, you know?

680
00:41:57,086 --> 00:41:58,966
As soon as they put
on that bloody DVD...

681
00:41:59,126 --> 00:42:01,446
Maybe we shouldn't
be afraid of the DVD.

682
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:03,006
I mean, like you said,

683
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:06,286
after you see it 50 times,
you become immune.

684
00:42:06,446 --> 00:42:12,046
So, what? Just play it
and play it and play it?

685
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:14,366
Maybe.

686
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:16,726
Oh.

687
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:20,766
I may have come up with a way

688
00:42:20,926 --> 00:42:24,846
to minimise the times the jury
has to look at that DVD.

689
00:42:27,326 --> 00:42:29,326
Oh, yeah.

690
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:33,566
But if we turn to frame 379...

691
00:42:33,726 --> 00:42:36,726
Mr Greene, really.

692
00:42:36,886 --> 00:42:39,606
The jury has already
watched this footage 13 times.

693
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:42,486
With great respect, Your Honour,
they have not seen it in slow motion,

694
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:45,086
nor frame-by-frame.

695
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:46,926
Frame-by-frame?

696
00:42:47,086 --> 00:42:51,086
Your Honour, this DVD
is the prosecution's case.

697
00:42:51,246 --> 00:42:53,766
It would be,
in my respectful submission,

698
00:42:53,926 --> 00:42:55,766
most prejudicial
to my client's defence

699
00:42:55,926 --> 00:42:59,166
if the jury did not become
intimately acquainted

700
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,366
with the act of which
he's being accused.

701
00:43:01,526 --> 00:43:03,486
Very well.

702
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:06,526
As you can see, there's
an unknown prostitute

703
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:10,046
sitting naked but for her face mask.

704
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:14,046
Then, uh, Felix enters frame,

705
00:43:14,206 --> 00:43:17,886
salivating, his tail bobbing about,

706
00:43:18,046 --> 00:43:20,246
his eagerness to participate

707
00:43:20,406 --> 00:43:24,246
evidenced by a very
impressive erection.

708
00:43:24,406 --> 00:43:28,166
Oh, and look — he's happily
wearing protective socks

709
00:43:28,326 --> 00:43:30,926
presumably so as to not scratch
the unknown prostitute

710
00:43:31,086 --> 00:43:33,166
with whom he's...

711
00:43:33,326 --> 00:43:36,046
Yeah. And there he goes.

712
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:41,126
Frame 32,875.

713
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:44,806
As you can see, Felix's tail
is still bobbing around.

714
00:43:44,966 --> 00:43:49,406
Frame 32,876.

715
00:43:49,566 --> 00:43:52,246
Oh, the lighting here is very good.

716
00:43:53,246 --> 00:43:59,486
And again if we turn to 86,426...

717
00:44:00,606 --> 00:44:03,686
..as you can see,
Felix's tail is still wagging about,

718
00:44:03,846 --> 00:44:05,806
he's still enjoying
the loving embraces

719
00:44:05,966 --> 00:44:08,406
of his master
and an unknown prostitute.

720
00:44:08,566 --> 00:44:10,686
Your Honour,
these constant references

721
00:44:10,846 --> 00:44:12,166
to an “unknown prostitute”...

722
00:44:12,326 --> 00:44:15,486
Yes,
I'm with you, Ms Habib.

723
00:44:15,646 --> 00:44:18,126
Can I see counsel
in chambers, please?

724
00:44:18,286 --> 00:44:20,446
We'll take 15 minutes.

725
00:44:20,606 --> 00:44:22,166
All rise.

726
00:44:23,726 --> 00:44:26,806
What's going on, Cleave?
We all know it's Mrs Chandler.

727
00:44:26,966 --> 00:44:29,046
My instructions are
that on December 27,

728
00:44:29,206 --> 00:44:32,886
Mrs Chandler was watching the cricket
with her mother in Rose Bay.

729
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:35,126
Ken, it's an insult to the court.

730
00:44:35,286 --> 00:44:38,326
Nadia, if you've got the evidence against
them, why haven't you charged her?

731
00:44:38,486 --> 00:44:40,606
Do I have to do
your job for you as well?

732
00:44:40,766 --> 00:44:42,966
When he gets in the box
I'll ask him about her

733
00:44:43,126 --> 00:44:45,446
and if he's lying
I'll have him for perjury as well.

734
00:44:45,606 --> 00:44:49,766
OK, my instructions
are the doctor and Mrs Chandler

735
00:44:49,926 --> 00:44:54,246
love their daughter Rebecca very much

736
00:44:54,406 --> 00:44:58,526
and wish her a long and happy life.

737
00:45:02,926 --> 00:45:05,886
Come on, guys. Give the kid a break.

738
00:45:10,766 --> 00:45:10,806
So, Dr D'Antonio, do you equate
the act my client is accused of

739
00:45:10,806 --> 00:45:15,166
So, Dr D'Antonio, do you equate
the act my client is accused of

740
00:45:15,326 --> 00:45:17,006
with the act of paedophilia?

741
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:18,806
Yes, I would, as a matter of fact.

742
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,446
In a moral sense?
Yes.

743
00:45:21,606 --> 00:45:24,886
So children and dogs,
they're pretty much the same to you?

744
00:45:25,046 --> 00:45:26,406
Objection.

745
00:45:26,566 --> 00:45:29,046
Mr Greene.
Your Honour.

746
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:33,606
Uh, Doctor, do you believe
the life of an animal

747
00:45:33,766 --> 00:45:36,406
equates to the life of a human being?

748
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:38,166
We are all animals, Mr Greene.

749
00:45:38,326 --> 00:45:40,406
I know I'm all animal, Dr D'Antonio.

750
00:45:42,046 --> 00:45:46,966
Doctor, do you value
the life of a dog or a sheep

751
00:45:47,126 --> 00:45:49,446
or a guinea pig

752
00:45:49,606 --> 00:45:52,086
as much as you value human life?

753
00:45:52,246 --> 00:45:54,886
I believe we've erred
in creating classes of people,

754
00:45:55,046 --> 00:45:56,366
classes of animals.

755
00:45:56,526 --> 00:45:59,766
It's affected our values, it's
affected the way we run the planet.

756
00:45:59,926 --> 00:46:01,686
Please answer the question, Doctor.

757
00:46:02,686 --> 00:46:04,166
Yes.

758
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:05,726
I don't see why a dog's life

759
00:46:05,886 --> 00:46:07,766
should be less valuable
than a human's life.

760
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,046
I see.

761
00:46:11,606 --> 00:46:17,086
Doctor, I put it to you that your
views on animal welfare are extreme

762
00:46:17,246 --> 00:46:19,806
and uncharacteristic of
current thinking on the subject.

763
00:46:19,966 --> 00:46:21,286
I reject that.

764
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:24,566
So you think that a dog should
be able to vote and drive a car?

765
00:46:24,726 --> 00:46:26,566
You're being ridiculous, Mr Greene.

766
00:46:26,726 --> 00:46:30,406
I don't think a dog should be forced
to have sex against his or her will.

767
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:33,166
Let's have another look
at the DVD, then, shall we?

768
00:46:33,326 --> 00:46:35,366
I'd encourage you, Doctor,

769
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:39,206
to show me the exact moment,
or moments,

770
00:46:39,366 --> 00:46:44,006
where you feel that Felix
is being forced or coerced

771
00:46:44,166 --> 00:46:46,006
or even encouraged.

772
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:48,726
There we go.

773
00:46:56,206 --> 00:46:58,646
Bec? Bec, what are you doing?

774
00:46:58,806 --> 00:47:00,286
My father's on trial in there.

775
00:47:00,446 --> 00:47:02,206
You don't want to go in there.

776
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:04,886
‘Cause of my mother?
Is she the other woman?

777
00:47:05,046 --> 00:47:06,046
No.

778
00:47:06,206 --> 00:47:07,766
Swear it wasn't
my mother in that room.

779
00:47:07,926 --> 00:47:09,846
You should know I'm an atheist,
so swearing really won't...

780
00:47:10,006 --> 00:47:13,006
Was it my mother? Please.

781
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:15,806
No, it's a prostitute.

782
00:47:16,806 --> 00:47:19,126
How can you be so sure?

783
00:47:19,286 --> 00:47:22,046
Her name's Wendy Brenner. She works
in a brothel called Club Jules.

784
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:25,886
Animals are her speciality.
I have her number if you want it.

785
00:47:27,046 --> 00:47:28,606
How do you know all this?

786
00:47:28,766 --> 00:47:30,846
It's my job.

787
00:47:35,406 --> 00:47:39,046
So where did you pick up
this prostitute, Dr Chandler?

788
00:47:40,406 --> 00:47:42,806
Well, I rang a brothel

789
00:47:42,966 --> 00:47:46,846
and I asked if there were any girls
that specialised in...

790
00:47:47,846 --> 00:47:49,166
..that sort of thing.

791
00:47:49,326 --> 00:47:51,366
I see.

792
00:47:51,526 --> 00:47:55,366
And how much did you pay
for this...specialisation?

793
00:47:56,366 --> 00:47:57,966
$3,000.

794
00:48:00,486 --> 00:48:02,806
No further questions.

795
00:48:04,846 --> 00:48:09,366
Australians as a nation
have always rooted for the underdog.

796
00:48:10,566 --> 00:48:16,286
Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is
my client didn't hurt anyone or anything.

797
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,166
Under New South Wales law,

798
00:48:20,326 --> 00:48:25,606
the maximum sentence I can get
for poisoning a water supply

799
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:27,926
is five years,

800
00:48:28,086 --> 00:48:32,606
but having sex with Felix,
the rottweiler with a waggly tail,

801
00:48:32,766 --> 00:48:37,446
allows for a sentence of 14 years.

802
00:48:38,446 --> 00:48:40,326
Now, Peter Singer —
considered the founding father

803
00:48:40,486 --> 00:48:42,606
of the animal rights movement —

804
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:46,446
has himself stated
that having sex with animals

805
00:48:46,606 --> 00:48:50,126
does not necessarily involve cruelty.

806
00:48:50,286 --> 00:48:54,566
The prosecution keep
banging on about consent,

807
00:48:54,726 --> 00:48:57,806
but do horses consent
to being ridden around a track,

808
00:48:57,966 --> 00:48:59,366
having their backsides whipped?

809
00:48:59,526 --> 00:49:02,166
Do rabbits consent to being tested

810
00:49:02,326 --> 00:49:05,566
for something Posh Spice
dabs on her pulse points?

811
00:49:05,726 --> 00:49:09,606
46 million families in America

812
00:49:09,766 --> 00:49:11,646
own at least one dog...

813
00:49:13,246 --> 00:49:15,326
..and this year they're going to cook

814
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:21,246
roughly 27 billion pounds of beef

815
00:49:21,406 --> 00:49:25,246
sliced from some 35 million

816
00:49:25,406 --> 00:49:31,126
harmless, sweet, vegetarian cows.

817
00:49:33,046 --> 00:49:35,166
It's a devastating hypocrisy.

818
00:49:35,326 --> 00:49:41,046
Ladies and gentlemen,
how many of you here own a dog

819
00:49:41,206 --> 00:49:43,006
but love a T-bone?

820
00:49:50,686 --> 00:49:53,806
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

821
00:49:54,806 --> 00:49:56,726
Yes, Your Honour.
What say you?

822
00:49:56,886 --> 00:50:00,006
We the jury find the defendant

823
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:01,006
not guilty.

824
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:04,726
- Thank you. Anything else?
- No, Your Honour.

825
00:50:04,886 --> 00:50:09,206
See, this scares me because I thought
he was completely screwed.

826
00:50:09,366 --> 00:50:12,206
How do you feel?
Pretty pumped.

827
00:50:26,126 --> 00:50:27,446
Hello.

828
00:50:27,606 --> 00:50:30,206
Ah. Joe Sandilands. Can you talk?

829
00:50:30,366 --> 00:50:31,686
Yeah.

830
00:50:31,846 --> 00:50:36,206
Good, good. Look, um,
I just got off the phone from David.

831
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,366
He sounds pretty low, Miss.
So?

832
00:50:38,526 --> 00:50:41,086
Look, I don't think you realise
how hard this is for him.

833
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,446
He didn't want to go
Karl Rove on Jack,

834
00:50:43,606 --> 00:50:45,166
but we gave him no other choice.

835
00:50:45,326 --> 00:50:46,646
Bravo.

836
00:50:46,806 --> 00:50:49,806
Come on, Miss.
You know he's crazy about you.

837
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:54,646
Look, the system
is morally bankrupt.

838
00:50:54,806 --> 00:50:57,526
That is why we need
people like David.

839
00:50:57,686 --> 00:51:00,366
Without them, how do you think
it's ever gonna change?

840
00:51:00,526 --> 00:51:03,766
Isn't that why you got into
politics, Joe? To change things?

841
00:51:05,086 --> 00:51:06,606
I forget.

842
00:51:11,046 --> 00:51:15,246
Right. Got it. We're off.
Where do you wanna go?

843
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,846
You know what? I'm beat.

844
00:51:18,006 --> 00:51:19,526
No. Really?

845
00:51:19,686 --> 00:51:22,246
Yeah. Another time?

846
00:51:29,726 --> 00:51:33,806
‘D' is for ‘Dog'. ‘Dog'.

847
00:52:26,606 --> 00:52:29,766
I love you so much.
I'm so sorry.

848
00:52:29,926 --> 00:52:32,806
Shh, shh, shh.

849
00:52:32,966 --> 00:52:34,406
It's not your fault.
