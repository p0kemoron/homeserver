1
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:41,245
Bosoms don't have to be big.

2
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:44,245
Surely the great test of a democracy

3
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:47,525
is its enduring ability
to handle truth.

4
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:49,805
That's not what it's about for me.

5
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:52,965
They can be small and pert.

6
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,605
When the Athenian Draco
began to wrestle with

7
00:00:55,765 --> 00:01:00,525
the inherent difficulties posed by
the notion of democracy in 631 BC,

8
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:04,285
he set forward a series of propositions
that have reverberated

9
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:07,125
over the brutal passage
of the past 2,500 years.

10
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:09,325
It's about the nipple.

11
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:13,605
We in the Western world
still struggle to understand

12
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:16,325
all that the term ‘democracy' entails.

13
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:19,125
No, correction.
It's more than that.

14
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:21,565
It's about the areola.

15
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:24,405
When Western governments
stifle information

16
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:27,005
in the pretence they are
protecting democracy,

17
00:01:27,165 --> 00:01:29,485
when through
the uncritical gaze of media

18
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:32,325
they extol the need for secrecy
and covert operation,

19
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:36,005
then bit by bit
we erode the very fundamentals

20
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:37,645
of free and open government.

21
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:40,005
I love the dark bit
around the nipple.

22
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:42,885
Sometimes it isn't dark.

23
00:01:43,045 --> 00:01:45,005
Sometimes it's more pink.

24
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,765
I don't like that as much.

25
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:50,565
I am effectively
charged with treason,

26
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:53,605
‘heresy' in the language
of the Spanish Inquisition,

27
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:56,245
where this trial rightly belongs.

28
00:01:56,405 --> 00:02:01,245
Treason because I chose to release
so-called top secret information.

29
00:02:01,405 --> 00:02:04,645
Only top secret because
they didn't want the public to know

30
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:07,485
of the lies and the deceit
that they were trying to conceal.

31
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:13,485
I could have fought extradition,
but I chose not to.

32
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:16,685
I have come home voluntarily,

33
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:20,245
not only to defend these charges
but to defend democracy,

34
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:23,645
and if that is a crime...
then hang me.

35
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:26,885
Josh, do you think
you'll get a fair trial?

36
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:37,965
Thank you.

37
00:02:39,685 --> 00:02:44,005
Care to accompany me to the police
station for my twice daily weigh-in?

38
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,525
Oh, Josh, that's
just what I had in mind.

39
00:02:46,685 --> 00:02:49,805
We going the right way?
“If that is a crime then hang me”?

40
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:53,605
It's pretty butch, right?
You are the consummate wanker.

41
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:56,565
Oh! Come on, remind me not to
call you as a character witness.

42
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:58,805
They will call me, won't they?
Mm-hm.

43
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:00,845
Ex-prostitute, political contacts.

44
00:03:01,005 --> 00:03:02,845
They're gonna throw
everything they can at us, huh?

45
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:04,045
Bet on it.

46
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:07,125
If I do end up going to prison
for the rest of my natural life,

47
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:09,365
at least you can write another
warts-and-all novel about it.

48
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:11,445
You'll make millions.
Left.

49
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:15,405
What is this place?

50
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:17,605
A portal to a lion's den

51
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,805
somehow springs to mind.

52
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:22,565
I wouldn't be surprised.

53
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,125
Yeah?

54
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:29,205
It wasn't as though
I was touching the nipples.

55
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:31,805
I was metres away each time.

56
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:34,085
That's not a crime, is it?

57
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:37,165
I think you'll find, Alistair,
that being a peeping Tom

58
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:40,925
does actually infringe the democratic
rights of other free citizens,

59
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:45,765
particularly those with pouting,
or even sagging, breasts.

60
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,685
Would you mind waiting outside
for a minute

61
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:52,765
while I go over the nuances of
this matter with Mr Lincoln Lincoln?

62
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:54,405
Sure.

63
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:05,525
Where's the file?

64
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:10,605
There is, um, a tad of confusion
with the paperwork.

65
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:14,925
Yes, well, unless that fella
is a 53-year-old mother of two,

66
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:17,725
there would appear
to be some confusion.

67
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:22,885
I think that that is a photograph
of the woman whose breasts were...

68
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:25,045
I think it might be useful
for the case

69
00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:27,125
if we have the file
of the accused.

70
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:29,245
No, that's exactly right.

71
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:32,485
No, it's either right
or it's not right.

72
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:34,725
It's either exact or it's inexact.

73
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:36,485
The combination of the two words

74
00:04:36,645 --> 00:04:39,245
doesn't make it either
more right or more exact.

75
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:42,205
That's very true, isn't it?

76
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:53,045
Alistair. Eyes up.

77
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:54,125
Yeah.
Yeah.

78
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:56,805
Lincoln is gonna let you know
when we have a date.

79
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:58,885
I've given Mr Emery the date.

80
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:01,805
Oh.
There's no trial date yet.

81
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:03,605
OK, then, I won't. But I will.

82
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:06,925
Do you want a hand there?
Oh, no, thanks.

83
00:05:07,085 --> 00:05:09,245
I haven't sealed it yet.
Thanks.

84
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:11,685
Uh, shall we, Mr Emery?

85
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:15,845
Um...just watch the...
Yeah. Yeah.

86
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:17,965
Sorry.
No.

87
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:25,605
Have we found a new home yet?
No, we haven't!

88
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:30,725
What else have we got on
apart from the areola-philiac?

89
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:33,765
A couple of parole violations,
AVO application,

90
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:36,845
another flasher, burglary.

91
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:39,205
Armed?
No, afraid not.

92
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:40,365
Oh.

93
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:42,365
Oh, here we are.
Got a nice little bashing.

94
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:44,205
Oh, and it's grievous.
Great.

95
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:46,445
No money in the light ones.

96
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:49,325
Sally! Come out and talk to me!

97
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:51,725
I have rights! It was my child too!

98
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:54,885
Sally, please, just talk to me!

99
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:56,965
Fuzz! For Christ's sake,
can you shut up?

100
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,885
You're humiliating us
in front of the whole neighbourhood.

101
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:00,925
What's happening?
Sally! I love you!

102
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:04,005
Do you hear me?!
Everyone except her can hear you.

103
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:05,605
You OK?
It's OK. It's fine.

104
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,485
Go back inside.
He's just having a drug episode.

105
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:08,965
No, I'm bloody well not!

106
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,445
It's better they think

107
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:12,005
you're a normal 18-year-old
with normal problems.

108
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:14,245
You tried to bash her door in
when you found out.

109
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:15,445
I had cause!

110
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:17,285
Did you know she was
having an abortion?

111
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:20,245
Oh, God! What did you expect
she was going to do? Grow up, Fuzz!

112
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:22,925
She's a divorced mother of two
and you haven't even finished school!

113
00:06:23,085 --> 00:06:25,965
OK! Mum, we had a connection.
We could have worked it through.

114
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,765
Oh, yeah, you could have
bought a small farm

115
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:31,645
and grown organic alpacas
and raised cushions.

116
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:33,205
Stop being weird.

117
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:35,685
Why can't you at least
get a girl your own age pregnant?

118
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:37,605
You're worried about
what they think?

119
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,525
They all think you're pathetic.

120
00:06:41,205 --> 00:06:42,605
Sally!

121
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:44,085
Sally!

122
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:47,045
Yell all you like.
She's gone to Byron.

123
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:48,405
SALLY!

124
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:50,365
Oh, he's single again,
if you're interested.

125
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,965
Mr Greene, I believe
you're representing yourself?

126
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,565
Yes, that's right.
I am capable of that.

127
00:06:56,725 --> 00:06:58,845
Others need a lot more help.

128
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:01,605
As I say, let's try and
keep it constructive, shall we?

129
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:04,445
Mr McManus, would you
like to kick off?

130
00:07:04,605 --> 00:07:06,725
Yes, the facts are as outlined...

131
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,485
The facts are that this man,

132
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:13,845
probably through a deep personal sense
of self-loathing and failure,

133
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:17,485
shamelessly lied and defamed me
in a blog and on radio.

134
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,965
Failure! Failure!

135
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:22,205
Before he ran off to the safety
of the stalls at State Parliament,

136
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:24,845
this cock was a hack tax lawyer,
for Christ sakes.

137
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:26,885
I'm hearing a lot
of emotional language here.

138
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:29,445
Please let Mr Potter make his case.
He doesn't have one.

139
00:07:29,605 --> 00:07:36,325
This asexual pontificating clown
slandered me and I responded in kind.

140
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:38,525
I underestimated, however,

141
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:40,565
the sensitivity
of his emotional condition...

142
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:42,285
Please, Mr Greene.

143
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:47,485
You are a pathetic, alcoholic,
drug-addled excuse of a man,

144
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:51,605
a tragic example of everything
gone wrong in the legal profession...

145
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:53,685
Yes, and I don't think that's
particularly helpful, either.

146
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:55,445
He is beyond help.

147
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:58,405
To invest any effort in him
is a waste of breath.

148
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:00,965
Shall we recalibrate here?
Recalibrate away, love.

149
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:02,965
Unless you can do it with
mime or picture cards,

150
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,445
he won't understand it.

151
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:23,485
Well, I'm sorry our mediation process
has been cut off at the nuts.

152
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:26,285
Looks like you'll be paying
your circus monkey

153
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:28,085
for a while longer, mate.

154
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,205
What?

155
00:08:32,365 --> 00:08:34,645
This one's on the house, Cleave.

156
00:08:36,325 --> 00:08:37,965
Oh, Tom!

157
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,965
Mate!

158
00:08:41,925 --> 00:08:44,685
And here's the Canadian survey
on mandatory sentencing.

159
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:46,725
It's a few years old.
Yeah, read it.

160
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:49,085
Same conclusion as
the British study, right?

161
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,565
It's never worked anywhere.

162
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:54,165
You know the Yanks jailed
a 17-year-old kid for life

163
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,965
for stealing a can of soft drink?

164
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,085
I mean, three strikes
and you're out. It's madness.

165
00:08:58,245 --> 00:08:59,565
Hold on.

166
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:02,645
I thought I was in for
an all-in brawl with you on this.

167
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:04,205
On mandatory sentencing?
Uh-huh.

168
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:07,885
No. The evidence is in.
It doesn't work.

169
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:12,525
Hey, Engels, what do you make of
this Joshua Floyd business?

170
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,165
Oh, um...

171
00:09:15,165 --> 00:09:17,285
Well, as a civil libertarian,
I'm torn.

172
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:21,325
If what he leaked endangers lives,
I don't know.

173
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:23,285
Yeah, but he's got a point,
though, hasn't he?

174
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:26,445
I mean, all this bloody secrecy
over bugger all, really.

175
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:28,965
The public already know
we're a bunch of liars and frauds.

176
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,845
Why not make it official?

177
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:34,365
Still, bloody glad
it's not our fight.

178
00:09:47,405 --> 00:09:48,245
Col.

179
00:09:48,405 --> 00:09:52,045
Very, very bad news,
I'm afraid, mate.

180
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:53,685
What's that?

181
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:55,725
Kirsty's father passed away.

182
00:09:55,885 --> 00:09:57,765
She's very upset.

183
00:09:57,925 --> 00:10:00,245
Oh, that's t...that's...

184
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:02,205
Bummer.

185
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:06,045
She was an only child,
so they were really, really close.

186
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,245
Terrific bloke.

187
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:12,645
We shared many a laugh over
a coldie, always up for a yarn.

188
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:14,965
I'm gonna order some flowers
straightaway.

189
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,445
Nicole!

190
00:10:16,605 --> 00:10:18,565
She's your woman, mate.

191
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:22,525
You need to be by her side now.
She is hurtin'.

192
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:26,165
And I will be by her side, mate.

193
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,245
It's just, you know, tomorrow's...

194
00:10:30,245 --> 00:10:33,005
Maybe I can move my 9am.

195
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:37,205
You can move them all before
I move every organ in your body.

196
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:40,845
Consider it done.

197
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:44,885
Look. Look, there he is
with me when I was five.

198
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:49,285
A fine, fine-looking man.

199
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:51,045
No, that's a farmhand.
That's him there.

200
00:10:51,205 --> 00:10:52,725
Even better-looking.

201
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:56,685
That's our farm,
and that was my pony, Wingo.

202
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:58,925
A magnificent animal.

203
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:04,205
His real name was Ringo, but when
I was little I couldn't say my ‘R's,

204
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:09,925
and so Daddy said to me, he said,
“It's alright, love...Wingo he is.”

205
00:11:11,165 --> 00:11:14,645
Too many memories.
Too many to count.

206
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:18,645
So...

207
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:23,685
So, I guess the farm's yours now?
No, no.

208
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:26,365
After all that...
after all that shit with Mick,

209
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:29,205
Daddy said to me, “You know, I know
you've got your own dreams, love.

210
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:31,205
‘I know you're not gonna
want to run the farm,”

211
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:33,645
and so he sold it
and he gave me all the money.

212
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:36,765
That's the sort of man he was.

213
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:44,885
So, he sort of willed it to you
before he died.

214
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:47,125
Is that right?

215
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:51,525
I can't believe
you're asking us this.

216
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:54,245
The gall is gobsmacking,
even by your standards.

217
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:58,045
It's common practice.
More than that, it's common sense.

218
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:00,245
He isn't dead.
And thank God for that.

219
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:02,485
But how can you possibly
claim your share of his estate

220
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:03,965
if he isn't dead?!

221
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:08,245
Look...Dad loves us, alright?
He wants us to be happy.

222
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:10,445
I'm gonna get a third anyway,

223
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:14,605
and it just so happens that I have
a great need right at the moment,

224
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:17,205
and so if I could just
get an advance on that.

225
00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:21,205
Not all of it, just enough to
get me out of a temporary bog.

226
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,925
You keep pissing your life
up against a wall, don't you, Cleaver?

227
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:26,485
I will discount my share.

228
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,205
And what about the money
we spend on him while he is alive?

229
00:12:29,365 --> 00:12:31,525
That's the beauty of the discount.

230
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,805
Cleaver, he hasn't
left you anything.

231
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:38,005
“Lily and Jane, thank you
for being such a comfort to me

232
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:40,125
“in difficult times.

233
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:42,045
“To you, I leave my house

234
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:45,085
“and any cash in whatever
accounts I may have,

235
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,405
“and I also leave you
all my shares.”

236
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:53,125
Well...yeah, he's gotta...
Does he mention me somewhere?

237
00:12:53,285 --> 00:12:55,525
“To Cleaver, I leave you my watch.

238
00:12:57,525 --> 00:13:00,125
‘I have given you
a lot in life, son,

239
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:03,085
“and you have earned a great deal
of money in your career

240
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:05,965
“and have been given
ample opportunity.

241
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,325
“Know that I love you
and still hope...still hope

242
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:13,805
‘you can make something...
better of your life.”

243
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:20,045
I told him that
I thought it was unfair.

244
00:13:20,205 --> 00:13:21,805
Cleave, he does love you.

245
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:24,205
It's just that he pinned
SO many hopes on you and...

246
00:13:30,245 --> 00:13:33,445
OK, this is worse than
the grilling I got from ASIO.

247
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:36,965
Who's grilling? I'm just asking.
You saw her yesterday.

248
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,445
Why is it necessary for her
to join us here tonight?

249
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:42,605
Your past is littered
with way more baggage than mine.

250
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:44,925
My God, woman,
you wrote a book about it.

251
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:48,005
Yes, but it's in the past.
As is Therese.

252
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:49,605
We divorced five years ago.

253
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:52,085
Our time together's precious.

254
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:54,125
Well, listen,
if it wasn't for Therese,

255
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:56,085
good plumbing probably
wouldn't even exist.

256
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:58,765
She raised a lot of money.
She still is.

257
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:04,285
I don't wanna argue. We don't even
know how many more nights we have.

258
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:06,365
I don't wanna spend it arguing.

259
00:14:06,525 --> 00:14:09,605
OK, don't overplay
the life behind bars thing.

260
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,645
It loses impact.
Hmm.

261
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:16,365
So when am I gonna meet
Cleaver Greene?

262
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:18,885
This ex-great love of yours?

263
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:20,525
Stop saying that.

264
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:23,325
And just for the record... Oh.

265
00:14:23,485 --> 00:14:25,925
How great. She's early.

266
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:33,325
I'm really tired.

267
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:36,725
I don't think I'll read
the rest of those submissions.

268
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:45,725
OK.

269
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:49,445
What?

270
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:52,685
Nothing.

271
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:55,325
Fine.

272
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:57,125
There's no reading.

273
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,525
No reading, then.

274
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:02,845
Let's have another month
without reading.

275
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:05,325
You can if you want to.
No, it's fine.

276
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:10,085
Barn, if you wanna have sex...

277
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:14,325
Who said anything about sex?

278
00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:20,565
No, I wanna read.

279
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:23,045
I wanna read all night.

280
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:26,285
Long and hard and deep.

281
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:36,525
Oh, God, I'm coming. I'm coming!

282
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:40,165
on

283
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:41,645
LAUGHS)

284
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:44,725
Oh. Oh.

285
00:15:44,885 --> 00:15:50,525
Oh, I'm feeling so many emotions
right now, you know,

286
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:56,685
like, um, oh, God, grief and joy

287
00:15:56,845 --> 00:16:00,365
and, oh, shit, maybe even love.

288
00:16:01,485 --> 00:16:02,805
Oh.

289
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:07,245
Kirsty, uh, we really need to talk.
What?

290
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:09,925
I'm just worried that
things between us are...

291
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:12,725
Are what? What?
Come on, tell me.

292
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:14,365
No, just that they're...

293
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:17,205
..too good.
Aw.

294
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:21,165
You know, the last time I ever felt
like this about anyone, you know,

295
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:22,805
it was when...it was when Mick...

296
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:27,045
Yeah, got put away for chopping
your lover up into bite-sized chunks

297
00:16:27,205 --> 00:16:28,725
and burying him under asphalt.

298
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:32,885
Mmm. I don't think
I could go through that again.

299
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:38,965
And that sentiment does you
no end of credit, Kirsty.

300
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,525
Oh, thank you.
Really.

301
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:45,405
But the thing is...

302
00:16:45,565 --> 00:16:51,325
..we just...we come from
such different worlds, you know?

303
00:16:51,485 --> 00:16:55,525
I mean, I move in such weird,
tricky little circles.

304
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:57,005
Yeah.

305
00:16:57,165 --> 00:17:02,045
I'm just worried that
that's gonna destroy us both.

306
00:17:10,805 --> 00:17:12,685
You're right.

307
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:15,805
I am, arent I?
Yeah.

308
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:18,725
Yeah.
Dammit.

309
00:17:20,445 --> 00:17:23,565
We'll just have to introduce
each other to each other's worlds.

310
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:29,445
When the Athenian Draco
began to wrestle with

311
00:17:29,605 --> 00:17:34,485
the inherent difficulties posed by
the notion of democracy in 631 BC,

312
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:37,205
he set forward a series
of propositions...

313
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:41,445
Draco the Athenian. Fuck me.

314
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:44,925
Joshua, the interminable wanker.

315
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:48,885
Wendy?

316
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:51,765
Hi. Sorry to call. I just...

317
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:55,405
Fuzz has flipped out again.
He found out she had an abortion.

318
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:58,125
Who, Sally?
No, my mother.

319
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,005
Yes, of course bloody Sally.

320
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:04,165
She's gone to Byron, so at least
I'm not gonna be a grandmother

321
00:18:04,325 --> 00:18:06,165
to a woman who's nearly
a year older than me.

322
00:18:06,325 --> 00:18:10,485
Well, um, technically you were
never actually gonna be that,

323
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:13,445
but that's a good result
then, isn't it?

324
00:18:13,605 --> 00:18:18,045
Oh, he's blaming me,
you, the universe.

325
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:19,725
Want me to come over?

326
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:22,685
No, it's alright.
I just wanted to talk to you.

327
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:28,085
Oh, well, at least
he knows we adore him.

328
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:30,965
That's gotta count
for something, hasn't it?

329
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,045
Yeah, well, we can love him
all we like,

330
00:18:33,205 --> 00:18:34,925
but he's still kicking in doors.

331
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:39,405
Do you remember
how you felt when he was born?

332
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:41,325
Yeah.

333
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:43,365
Delirious.

334
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:45,965
He was such a happy baby.

335
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,285
Well, you know, I mean,

336
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:52,605
happiness is a pretty fluid
old concept these days.

337
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,325
I mean, it's basically
people sipping lattes, isn't it?

338
00:18:56,805 --> 00:18:59,325
You know, every lifestyle ad
you see these days

339
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:02,405
has got a his or her professional
chugging down a latte.

340
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:10,165
You know, we've got
no other fucking vision of happiness,

341
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:14,245
save pouring frothy milk
over the top of beans

342
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:16,765
picked by indentured
12-year-old labour.

343
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:18,765
Have you got
someone there?

344
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:22,645
Yep, but, um, don't worry about it.

345
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:26,925
Why didn't you tell me?
Oh, no, it's...it's OK.

346
00:19:27,085 --> 00:19:32,405
She's just a...woman
I owe some money to.

347
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:37,445
You heard Dr Anastasio's view

348
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:41,845
that in Alistair's loneliness
and lack of self-worth,

349
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:49,005
he emotionally fixated on the very time
that he felt safe and loved,

350
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:52,485
when he was suckling
on his mother's bosoms.

351
00:19:52,645 --> 00:19:55,885
This is not about sex.

352
00:20:05,765 --> 00:20:09,365
He never touched any of these women.

353
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:13,885
Spied on them, yes,
and maybe masturbated in public.

354
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:17,045
But these are symptoms
of a profound condition.

355
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:20,285
Mr Emery poses no threat
to society whatsoever.

356
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:25,005
He is a sick, sick man
and he needs treatment.

357
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:28,605
We do not lock up sick people,
we treat them.

358
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:40,165
He keeps going on about that.

359
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:42,405
Cleaver. Cleaver, there's
someone I want you to meet.

360
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:44,445
Ah.
Joshua, this is Cleaver.

361
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:45,925
Hi.

362
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:48,365
“We don't lock up sick people,
we treat them.”

363
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:50,085
Great stuff. Very entertaining.

364
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:54,285
Yes, well, I was gonna invoke
the ghost of the Athenian Draco,

365
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:57,125
but it felt — what's the word? —
pretentious?

366
00:20:57,285 --> 00:20:59,125
Yeah, that's exactly what she said.

367
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:00,605
Excuse me.

368
00:21:00,765 --> 00:21:02,445
Sean, mate.

369
00:21:03,645 --> 00:21:04,965
Just give me a sec, will you?

370
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,445
Sorry, I have to take this.

371
00:21:06,605 --> 00:21:08,565
Sean Penn's coordinating
some support for me in the States.

372
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,805
It was great meeting you.
Coordinate away.

373
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:14,485
Tell the Sean-meister
he owes me a grand from Vegas.

374
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:21,365
Well, your practice
is still flourishing, I see.

375
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:25,005
“Great stuff.
Really entertaining.”

376
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:27,845
What the fuck are you supposed to say

377
00:21:28,005 --> 00:21:32,085
about a guy who jerks off over
the dark circles around nipples?

378
00:21:32,245 --> 00:21:34,485
Maybe his dad was a big darts man.

379
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:36,805
So you gonna come tomorrow or not?

380
00:21:36,965 --> 00:21:40,125
Remind me.
The lunch.

381
00:21:40,285 --> 00:21:42,645
Come on, you're frightened
that you'll like him.

382
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:46,125
He's funny, he's rude,
he loves getting up people's noses.

383
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:48,525
There's gonna be some
seriously important people there.

384
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:51,045
Oh, sweetheart, you are
talking to an open door.

385
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:52,565
Will Sean be in attendance?

386
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:55,405
Let me just... I'll park the Prius.
I'll be right along.

387
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:56,965
You know what I think?

388
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,245
I think you dislike him
on the compelling principle

389
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,965
that he's fighting a truly noble cause
you wish you were fighting.

390
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:05,245
Sweetheart, no. No.

391
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:06,245
Thank you.

392
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:09,085
And you wonder why I describe you
as a child in my book.

393
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,045
Your name will be on the door.

394
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,925
Yeah, but, look, I've gotta go.

395
00:22:13,085 --> 00:22:14,525
Alright, well, just email me
through everything,

396
00:22:14,685 --> 00:22:16,525
then I'll have a look at it, OK?

397
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:20,605
OK, how'd that go?

398
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:33,005
Cal. What the hell is this?
I don't know. What is it?

399
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:36,445
“An inside source
said it is hotly rumoured

400
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,245
“that the Attorney-General
will introduce

401
00:22:38,405 --> 00:22:41,125
‘mandatory sentencing legislation
in the life of this parliament.”

402
00:22:41,285 --> 00:22:42,605
Here.

403
00:22:42,765 --> 00:22:44,085
Fuck.

404
00:22:44,245 --> 00:22:46,005
No photo.

405
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:49,045
Um, what happened to,
“Mandatory sentencing doesn't work.

406
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:50,605
“The evidence is in”?

407
00:22:50,765 --> 00:22:53,285
It is in. It doesn't work.
Why wouldn't they print a photo?

408
00:22:53,445 --> 00:22:56,085
Why did you have me running around
chasing up all those studies?

409
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:59,045
Oh, well, I have to counter
all arguments.

410
00:22:59,205 --> 00:23:02,325
I mean, look, I don't like this
any more than you do,

411
00:23:02,485 --> 00:23:05,685
but that's what the tabloids
tell the people that they want.

412
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:09,045
Right? That's the trouble with having
a bloody democracy and a free press.

413
00:23:09,205 --> 00:23:11,365
Can't cope with both, Engels.

414
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,005
Fucking idiots.
They'd have thousands on file.

415
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:22,765
And it's still OK
if I come and watch you milk,

416
00:23:22,925 --> 00:23:25,845
and grab a couple of litres and see
if we can make ice-cream with it.

417
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,085
What do you reckon?

418
00:23:28,245 --> 00:23:32,005
This mob are exactly the kind
of self-sufficient smallholdings...

419
00:23:34,925 --> 00:23:36,925
Get out of it.

420
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:45,365
Jesus Christ!

421
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:47,845
I hope you don't mind.

422
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:49,765
I had a key cut.

423
00:23:49,925 --> 00:23:52,565
I've got a key for my apartment
to give to you as well.

424
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:55,005
Oh, beauty.

425
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:58,485
You know, I woke up this morning
and I said to myself,

426
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,885
“Kirsty Corella,
get a hold of yourself.

427
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:03,405
“Your daddy wouldn't want you
wallowing around in the blues.”

428
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:04,925
So I thought to myself, didn't I,

429
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:06,765
I thought what about...
what about a little lunch?

430
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:12,325
Ah. Oh, that'd be great, but I'm...I'm,
uh...I'm a bit busy, guys.

431
00:24:15,485 --> 00:24:17,285
Actually...
What?

432
00:24:17,445 --> 00:24:19,125
Do you know what?

433
00:24:19,285 --> 00:24:21,445
Let's do it.

434
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:24,605
Come on, all work and no play.
Come on.

435
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:29,125
Let's go, I've got...
I've got the perfect venue for us.

436
00:24:29,285 --> 00:24:30,605
Really?
Yeah.

437
00:24:30,765 --> 00:24:33,205
We are going to have a blast.

438
00:24:43,205 --> 00:24:44,885
“good plumbing”?

439
00:24:45,045 --> 00:24:47,245
I know this prick.

440
00:24:47,405 --> 00:24:50,365
This bastard sold
our country's secrets.

441
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:52,485
Let me guess which paper you read.
Yeah.

442
00:24:52,645 --> 00:24:54,725
But it's gonna be full of celebs.

443
00:24:54,885 --> 00:24:57,125
Like who?
Oh, they'll all be in here.

444
00:24:57,285 --> 00:25:00,045
Russell's in there,
Nicole'll be in there.

445
00:25:00,205 --> 00:25:02,285
The bald chef from the TV show
you're always talking about,

446
00:25:02,445 --> 00:25:03,765
he'll be in there.

447
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:05,365
Draco the Athenian will be there.

448
00:25:05,525 --> 00:25:07,805
Maybe you can get some autographs.
You've got quite a collection now.

449
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,725
This is very much
an autograph kind of an event.

450
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:14,445
If you wanna be a part of
my world, this is it.

451
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:16,045
Mate, am I dressed right for this?

452
00:25:16,205 --> 00:25:19,085
Oh, mate, it's very much
come as you are. Yeah.

453
00:25:19,245 --> 00:25:20,685
Excuse me, sir,
your name please?

454
00:25:20,845 --> 00:25:22,285
Look, we're here
with the bridal party.

455
00:25:22,445 --> 00:25:26,845
This is His Serene Highness, Prince Col
of Batavia, the Duchess Kirsty.

456
00:25:27,005 --> 00:25:29,365
Yeah, OK, mate. Piss off outta here.

457
00:25:29,525 --> 00:25:31,685
Well, let's...
Hi. Hi, you came.

458
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:33,845
Hi. I'm Melissa. Col, right?
Yeah, Col.

459
00:25:34,005 --> 00:25:36,125
G'day.
Yes, I remember. Hi.

460
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,885
And?
Kirsty. Hi.

461
00:25:39,045 --> 00:25:43,085
Yeah, I'm Cleaver's, um...
I suppose... Yeah, we're an item.

462
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:47,805
Terrific. Why don't you come in
and talk to Joshua?

463
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,445
Let's.

464
00:25:53,245 --> 00:25:57,165
Shit. That is Magda, isn't it?
Over there.

465
00:25:57,325 --> 00:25:59,605
That is Magda.

466
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:02,565
She seems nice.

467
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:05,245
She's, uh...she's extraordinary.

468
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:07,325
We're very much in love.

469
00:26:07,485 --> 00:26:10,125
If you're trying to make a scene,
Josh won't give a rat's arse.

470
00:26:10,285 --> 00:26:11,365
Hey, Cleaver.

471
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:17,005
I'm sorry. I've forgotten
your name already.

472
00:26:17,165 --> 00:26:19,165
Oh, I'm hard
to avoid, aren't I?

473
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,365
Ted's here.
We'll talk.

474
00:26:23,365 --> 00:26:24,845
Will we?

475
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:30,805
Historically, America
had the chance to back India,

476
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:33,245
but they were so fearful
of its ties to Russia,

477
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:36,805
they poured billions of dollars
in military aid into Pakistan instead.

478
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:38,845
They turned it
into a military dictatorship,

479
00:26:39,005 --> 00:26:41,005
and India is a vibrant democracy.

480
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:44,085
It's the wrong intelligence,
and everyone bought the lie.

481
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:47,645
You give people all the facts
and we can make better choices.

482
00:26:47,805 --> 00:26:51,125
It's exactly the same with
‘Dancing with the Stars'.

483
00:26:51,285 --> 00:26:53,125
I think if everyone had have known

484
00:26:53,285 --> 00:26:55,765
that Tina and Roy were dancers
before the competition,

485
00:26:55,925 --> 00:26:57,485
it would have swayed public opinion.

486
00:26:57,645 --> 00:27:00,365
Denise and Warwick were ROBBED.

487
00:27:00,525 --> 00:27:02,605
Oh, I have to say, I thought
your article in ‘Harper's

488
00:27:02,765 --> 00:27:05,405
about the reductive capacity
of media was exactly right.

489
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:07,245
Excuse me. Thanks, pal.

490
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:09,245
Ah, marvellous.

491
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:11,645
Oh, Kirsty — Russell!

492
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:14,805
Shit.

493
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:17,845
Col, drink up, mate.
The revolution's paying.

494
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,525
Melissa. You look
absolutely gorgeous.

495
00:27:21,685 --> 00:27:23,325
Thanks, Therese. So do you.

496
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:26,405
Mind if I drag this man away?
It's time to earn his keep.

497
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,205
Excuse me, folks.

498
00:27:33,725 --> 00:27:35,685
So, is he what you were expecting?

499
00:27:35,845 --> 00:27:38,245
Ladies and gentlemen...
Ah...

500
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:40,845
I hate guys with two first names.

501
00:27:41,005 --> 00:27:43,845
It is my privilege to present
our hero of the hour,

502
00:27:44,005 --> 00:27:47,005
a man who faces
an eternity in prison

503
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,165
for defending the rights
of each and every person here,

504
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:56,125
a man who has always fought
government abuse of the individual.

505
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:59,245
I admire him more
than any other man I know,

506
00:27:59,405 --> 00:28:02,005
despite the fact
he is my ex-husband.

507
00:28:03,645 --> 00:28:05,925
Ladies and gentlemen, Joshua Floyd.

508
00:28:11,645 --> 00:28:13,685
Yeah!

509
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:15,165
Thank you.

510
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:18,485
Well, look, I'm not worthy of all this,
I promise you that.

511
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:20,165
I leaked some documents.

512
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:21,645
If we'd waited long enough,

513
00:28:21,805 --> 00:28:24,205
the public service would have
leaked all that shit by accident.

514
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,645
Mate, why do we drink beer, eh?

515
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:49,485
Be quicker to avoid the middle man

516
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,885
and pour it
straight down the toilet.

517
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:58,325
How familiar are you with these charges
they're hitting me with?

518
00:28:58,485 --> 00:29:00,045
Not my area.

519
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,445
No?
Nuh.

520
00:29:04,045 --> 00:29:06,565
But if you pressed me,
I'd say you're probably guilty.

521
00:29:06,725 --> 00:29:08,525
Really?
Yeah.

522
00:29:08,685 --> 00:29:12,165
Well, the whole point of the act
is to give the government

523
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:14,285
the power to lock up people
they don't like.

524
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:16,205
I mean, there's people
under this legislation

525
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:20,125
who've been arrested for wearing
inappropriate T-shirts at airports.

526
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:22,925
So, you know, they're gonna
get you for something.

527
00:29:23,085 --> 00:29:23,925
Mmm.

528
00:29:24,085 --> 00:29:27,085
Some might call it ‘draconian'.

529
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:28,845
I call it shit.

530
00:29:29,005 --> 00:29:31,685
You should try being
on the receiving end.

531
00:29:31,845 --> 00:29:35,205
Who's heading up your team?
Geoffrey?

532
00:29:35,365 --> 00:29:38,845
No. He's a smart man,
but not what I'm chasing.

533
00:29:40,285 --> 00:29:44,245
Well, who's your wig of choice, then?
Don't know.

534
00:29:45,405 --> 00:29:46,885
You interested?

535
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:50,085
Oh, yes, very droll.

536
00:29:52,245 --> 00:29:53,965
I'm serious.

537
00:29:56,245 --> 00:30:00,045
I'm not a silk, mate.
That makes two of us.

538
00:30:02,565 --> 00:30:07,085
You don't know anything about me.
I've asked around town.

539
00:30:07,245 --> 00:30:11,005
Look, if the people you've asked
are lawyers, most of them hate me.

540
00:30:11,165 --> 00:30:12,605
No, it's much worse than that, mate.

541
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:14,685
Almost every single one of them
described you as

542
00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:17,165
“an intriguing choice”.

543
00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:20,805
Is this a game?

544
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:24,125
If you don't want the gig...
No, I...

545
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:30,685
[-I'm not un...interested.

546
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:32,205
Good.

547
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:34,685
Then let's see
if we can make it work.

548
00:30:34,845 --> 00:30:37,165
Your chambers?
Say, 11 tomorrow?

549
00:30:38,245 --> 00:30:39,725
OK.

550
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:50,605
Cleave, Cleave,
can we go now, please?

551
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,605
Col's just had a bit of a thing
with Russell.

552
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:55,845
Oh, Jesus, quick.
Come on, let's go. He's coming.

553
00:30:56,005 --> 00:30:58,205
Cleaver, come on. Let's go! Go!

554
00:31:04,285 --> 00:31:05,685
What are you doing?

555
00:31:05,845 --> 00:31:07,285
I'm packing the last of the boxes.

556
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:10,205
I told you we don't have a room as of 9.
Fuck!

557
00:31:10,365 --> 00:31:11,685
What?
Fuck. OK.

558
00:31:11,845 --> 00:31:14,765
OK, you've gotta find out
who's in court. Ask around the PAs.

559
00:31:14,925 --> 00:31:16,765
Offer anyone who's got
a spare room 100 bucks

560
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:18,805
to get out at 11:00 for one hour.

561
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:22,045
We may have a new client.
Oh, what, rapist, thug or pederast?

562
00:31:22,205 --> 00:31:23,845
Joshua Floyd.
Oh, very funny.

563
00:31:26,365 --> 00:31:29,325
Joshua. Floyd.

564
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:34,085
I will build us chambers
if I cannot find one.

565
00:31:34,245 --> 00:31:35,725
Mm-hm.

566
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:43,485
Cleave, they're coming
out of the lift.

567
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:46,925
Shit.

568
00:31:58,445 --> 00:31:59,805
Mr Floyd.

569
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:01,925
Joshua, please.
Joshua, hi.

570
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:04,205
Hello, Melissa.
Hi, Nicole.

571
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:05,685
How are you?
Good.

572
00:32:05,845 --> 00:32:08,645
Are you married yet?
No, five weeks. Five weeks to go.

573
00:32:08,805 --> 00:32:10,325
How exciting.
Yeah.

574
00:32:10,485 --> 00:32:13,005
I loved your book. That's
the best ever description of him.

575
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:17,965
Well, the child is waiting, so please,
just, um, come on through.

576
00:32:21,645 --> 00:32:23,005
Welcome.

577
00:32:24,885 --> 00:32:29,045
There are three main
areas of attack, I reckon.

578
00:32:29,205 --> 00:32:31,525
There's at...there's at least
12 sections of the act

579
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:34,005
that are generally considered
to be loosely drafted

580
00:32:34,165 --> 00:32:35,525
and open to interpretation.

581
00:32:35,685 --> 00:32:39,045
Now, the good news is
that this is all virgin territory —

582
00:32:39,205 --> 00:32:41,605
none of these sections
have ever been tested before.

583
00:32:41,765 --> 00:32:43,765
Why do you think I'm here?

584
00:32:45,845 --> 00:32:47,645
Early onset dementia?

585
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:51,365
Look, I can get any damn QC in
the world to make a good argument,

586
00:32:51,525 --> 00:32:53,165
quote the act chapter and verse.

587
00:32:53,325 --> 00:32:54,965
What I need is someone

588
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:57,325
who's prepared to play
outside of the rules.

589
00:32:57,485 --> 00:33:00,525
Someone who can say ‘mammophile'
without flinching.

590
00:33:00,685 --> 00:33:03,565
Who can bring the circus
and the carnival to court.

591
00:33:03,725 --> 00:33:08,765
I need someone who can take
top secret, highly prejudicial evidence

592
00:33:08,925 --> 00:33:10,685
and still get it before a jury,

593
00:33:10,845 --> 00:33:14,525
someone who isn't frightened
to join me in a cell for a while.

594
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:19,445
Are you that guy?
Do I get top bunk?

595
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:25,085
Well, this one thinks you and I can
stop the world turning for a while.

596
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:27,925
Who's this?

597
00:33:31,405 --> 00:33:33,645
Uncle...lan.

598
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:38,245
He's...he's just
a funny, funny uncle.

599
00:33:38,405 --> 00:33:39,725
Do you remember him?

600
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,885
He's... And he's never aged.

601
00:33:42,045 --> 00:33:44,005
He's...

602
00:33:44,165 --> 00:33:45,005
What?

603
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:48,165
Cleave, Josh knows
you don't have chambers.

604
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:50,245
Oh, that's great.

605
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:53,245
You're what's known
as a floater, I believe.

606
00:33:53,405 --> 00:33:55,725
I'm a floater.

607
00:33:55,885 --> 00:33:57,485
Let's see what we can do
about that.

608
00:33:57,645 --> 00:33:59,805
I'm told this trial
might run for a year.

609
00:34:01,085 --> 00:34:02,405
At the least.

610
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:04,565
And it is gonna take you
completely out of action,

611
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:07,805
possibly damage
your...existing practice.

612
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:11,325
Well, I'll have to just suck that up.

613
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:13,285
Well, I have very wealthy backers

614
00:34:13,445 --> 00:34:15,325
who believe passionately
in this cause.

615
00:34:15,485 --> 00:34:18,725
We could offer you
a $6,000-a-day retainer.

616
00:34:18,885 --> 00:34:21,605
That should be enough to establish
chambers of your own.

617
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:24,965
Starting from today, of course.

618
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:29,045
With me, it's never about the money.

619
00:34:42,485 --> 00:34:45,445
Some of the world's leading lawyers
have offered their services,

620
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:46,925
and I am grateful,

621
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,245
but in the end, I have decided
to go with my heart.

622
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:53,045
Let the government tie up
every silk in the country —

623
00:34:53,205 --> 00:34:54,525
they will need them.

624
00:34:54,685 --> 00:34:57,885
I need only one man
to argue my case,

625
00:34:58,045 --> 00:34:59,685
someone who has spent his career

626
00:34:59,845 --> 00:35:03,765
fearlessly crusading for the rights
of ordinary people,

627
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:06,845
my friend, Cleaver Greene.

628
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:11,805
The other day,
Josh was talking about

629
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:16,925
the Athenian Draco's struggle
to define democracy.

630
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:20,965
I remember cheering at the TV
at the time.

631
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:24,525
Oh, someone please tell me
this is a fuckin' joke.

632
00:35:24,685 --> 00:35:27,205
..an end to the great lies
of government,

633
00:35:27,365 --> 00:35:32,405
to the pretence that our security
requires great cloaks of secrecy.

634
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:34,045
It does not.

635
00:35:34,205 --> 00:35:37,565
Bit by bit, imperceptibly,

636
00:35:37,725 --> 00:35:42,925
as our politicians and media
play on our darkest fears,

637
00:35:43,085 --> 00:35:46,085
we are robbed of our freedom.

638
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:53,125
Josh, let me jump you forward
2,500 years from Draco

639
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:56,285
and quote Martin Luther King.

640
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,925
“Our lives begin to end

641
00:36:00,085 --> 00:36:05,085
“the day we become silent
about the things that matter.”

642
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:07,325
Mr Greene, who will you
be calling for the defence?

643
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:14,445
Zazie got in trouble
for hitting Kyle.

644
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:18,245
I suppose you heard the news about
Cleaver and Joshua Floyd?

645
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:20,245
Yes, I did.

646
00:36:20,405 --> 00:36:23,485
Mr Crichton says he's gonna
suspend him if he does it again.

647
00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:26,085
He's bound to sack him.
It won't last.

648
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,445
Who knows?

649
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:31,005
You seriously think that

650
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:33,165
Joshua Floyd would put up
with Cleaver Greene?

651
00:36:34,165 --> 00:36:36,965
Yes. Because he's
a brilliant choice.

652
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,485
And somewhere,
you know that as well.

653
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:43,445
Hey, Dad, Zazie says he's gonna get
his dad in to belt up Mr Crichton.

654
00:36:43,605 --> 00:36:46,485
I suppose you wish you were
part of it too, don't you?

655
00:36:46,645 --> 00:36:48,565
Would you pass the pepper, please?

656
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:51,845
And now you're blaming me.
The pepper?

657
00:36:52,005 --> 00:36:53,525
Barney?

658
00:36:53,685 --> 00:36:56,245
Yes, of course I fuckin'
wanna be a part of it.

659
00:36:56,405 --> 00:36:58,005
Why did you say the F-word?

660
00:36:58,165 --> 00:36:59,965
This is why I became
a lawyer, Scarlet.

661
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:02,565
This is why Cleaver
became a lawyer.

662
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:07,165
This is what we dreamed about
at uni, this exact sort of case.

663
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:12,245
But because of a mistake you made,

664
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:14,165
and because some shrink tells us

665
00:37:14,325 --> 00:37:18,605
it's the only way to save
this chimera of a marriage...

666
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,885
..I'm not a part of it.

667
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:31,125
Don't let me stop you.

668
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:39,149
http://hiqve.com/

669
00:37:44,605 --> 00:37:48,285
Ah! Here's Santa!

670
00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:50,525
Oh, come on.

671
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,685
Mwah!

672
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:55,365
Oh, who's a good boy!
Who's a good boy?

673
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:57,925
Find the fucker. Where is the fucker?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

674
00:37:58,085 --> 00:38:00,125
Alright, alright.
Relax!

675
00:38:00,285 --> 00:38:02,885
Ah, hang on. Yep, I've got it.
It's here, I've got it.

676
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:04,405
Are you sure?
I've got it. Yes.

677
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:06,045
Thank you.
Thank you.

678
00:38:06,205 --> 00:38:08,365
- 17, do we have that?
- Yeah, yeah.

679
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:10,725
Sub-point 4,
and then I think it was...

680
00:38:16,365 --> 00:38:17,645
10 plus 23 is...

681
00:38:17,805 --> 00:38:19,165
Ah.
There it is in sub-clause 20.

682
00:38:19,325 --> 00:38:20,685
Great. That's the one.

683
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:33,005
Come on, Cock.

684
00:38:34,285 --> 00:38:35,645
The night's a pup.

685
00:38:47,085 --> 00:38:49,725
As we still don't have
a jury of 12,

686
00:38:49,885 --> 00:38:53,085
I shall allow you both
four challenges for cause.

687
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:54,725
Mr Greene.

688
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:57,365
Your Honour.

689
00:38:57,525 --> 00:38:59,525
Please complete this sentence.

690
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:02,925
I admire Alan Jones because...

691
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:05,365
Because he always tells the truth
when no-one else will...

692
00:39:05,525 --> 00:39:07,645
Thank you. You can go.

693
00:39:10,605 --> 00:39:13,725
I admire Alan Jones because...

694
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:16,285
He stands up for all those
who can't stand up for themselves.

695
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:18,165
Thank you. You can go.

696
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:24,285
Principle among the many reasons
I admire Alan Jones is...

697
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,805
I wouldn't listen to him.

698
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:28,845
Thank you.
You can keep your seat, please.

699
00:39:31,885 --> 00:39:33,205
OK.

700
00:39:33,365 --> 00:39:35,685
Alright, fine, if you won't
release the documents,

701
00:39:35,845 --> 00:39:38,725
I will subpoena
the entire US State Department

702
00:39:38,885 --> 00:39:40,325
and question you all individually.

703
00:39:40,485 --> 00:39:42,565
Be a nice little trip
to Australia for you.

704
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:44,365
No skin off my nose, pal.

705
00:39:44,525 --> 00:39:48,925
I couldn't get a year's lease
and it's still a fortune, but...

706
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:50,445
No, it's perfect. Mmm.

707
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:54,885
Alright, now, I don't want
people looking over our shoulders,

708
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:57,245
so locks changed
on all the doors, please.

709
00:39:57,405 --> 00:39:59,885
Oh, and I'm gonna need
a pullout sofa.

710
00:40:00,045 --> 00:40:01,725
I think I'll be sleeping here a bit.

711
00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:06,445
It's like working for a real lawyer.
Cool, huh?

712
00:40:07,965 --> 00:40:11,725
Hey, your name is mentioned on
the front page of ‘America Today'.

713
00:40:11,885 --> 00:40:13,765
“Leading Australian
civil rights lawyer”?

714
00:40:13,925 --> 00:40:15,605
Yeah, I don't have time
for all of that.

715
00:40:15,765 --> 00:40:19,565
Barney's at 10:00, yes?
Yes, 10:00. Yes.

716
00:40:28,965 --> 00:40:30,525
There's something
we need to talk about.

717
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:35,085
OK, look, if this is about
the Shadow Attorney-General suing me,

718
00:40:35,245 --> 00:40:36,565
I can explain.

719
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,845
That guy is a total...
I couldn't give a shit about that.

720
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:41,605
Oh, OK.

721
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,645
I'm sitting on an unexploded bomb.

722
00:40:48,525 --> 00:40:51,045
Information they don't even
begin to know I possess.

723
00:40:52,045 --> 00:40:54,405
It's an insurance policy,
if you will.

724
00:40:54,565 --> 00:40:58,085
Most of my intelligence came through
a high-level British attaché.

725
00:40:58,245 --> 00:41:00,045
Please don't ask names.

726
00:41:01,365 --> 00:41:04,485
But there is another source,
in Germany,

727
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:10,605
so sensitive that no-one outside you
even knows that he or she exists.

728
00:41:10,765 --> 00:41:14,445
May I ask what sort
of information this is?

729
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,965
Not yet, but if something
should happen to me...

730
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:19,845
Whoa, what do you mean?
No, I'm saying ‘if.

731
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:26,005
..an email will be sent
to this address.

732
00:41:28,525 --> 00:41:30,125
That's the password.

733
00:41:32,965 --> 00:41:34,885
Have you got it?

734
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:37,685
- Have you got it?
- Yes.

735
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:42,005
Now, understand if you choose to
release the contents of this email,

736
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:44,165
all hell will break loose.

737
00:41:45,285 --> 00:41:47,365
It could conceivably
bring down three governments

738
00:41:47,525 --> 00:41:50,165
and shake the foundations
of the Western banking system.

739
00:42:00,525 --> 00:42:03,925
Hey. How is working for
Darth Vader faring?

740
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:06,085
Seconds away from
mandatory sentencing, are we?

741
00:42:06,245 --> 00:42:09,125
He's actually smart, and his politics
are not what you think.

742
00:42:09,285 --> 00:42:11,845
He has none. He doesn't believe
in anything beyond winning.

743
00:42:12,005 --> 00:42:14,765
Well, your side can't even
believe in that anymore.

744
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:16,805
I thought we were your side as well.

745
00:42:16,965 --> 00:42:19,485
Just mind he doesn't use you
as pretty front of house.

746
00:42:19,645 --> 00:42:21,965
Nice of you
to look out for me, David.

747
00:42:31,045 --> 00:42:34,565
Oh. I am so bloody proud of you!

748
00:42:37,525 --> 00:42:39,405
I don't know if I'm up to this.

749
00:42:39,565 --> 00:42:41,245
Rubbish. You absolutely are.

750
00:42:41,405 --> 00:42:43,245
You should have been doing this
a long time ago.

751
00:42:43,405 --> 00:42:45,805
Oh, should I now?
Mm-hm. Absolutely.

752
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:46,845
Where's Oedipus?

753
00:42:47,005 --> 00:42:48,885
Just remember
what Oedipus did to his dad.

754
00:42:49,045 --> 00:42:52,085
How are you, mate?
I'm shit, thanks for asking.

755
00:42:52,245 --> 00:42:55,165
Listen, I know it's hard
at the moment but, you know...

756
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:57,525
Mate, in six months
you are gonna realise

757
00:42:57,685 --> 00:42:59,965
what a very big bullet
you just dodged.

758
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:03,405
Um, Fuzz has asked me to take him
somewhere, and I've refused.

759
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:05,925
But I don't know,
you might feel differently.

760
00:43:06,085 --> 00:43:07,765
Name it, pal.

761
00:43:16,285 --> 00:43:19,805
I'm waiting in the car.
No. Will you come with me?

762
00:43:21,085 --> 00:43:24,085
It'd be like letting a cane toad
into sugar fields, mate.

763
00:43:24,245 --> 00:43:25,965
I-I don't buy any of it,

764
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:30,125
you know, the flaming bushes and
holy ghosts and walking on water.

765
00:43:30,285 --> 00:43:33,045
It's all a bit like tax law
or something.

766
00:43:33,205 --> 00:43:35,285
I know it's weird,
I know it's half-baked.

767
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:38,165
I just have it in my head
I need to do this.

768
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:40,965
I need to confess to someone to...
Confess to me.

769
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:44,045
Confessing to you is like receiving
career advice from Chopper Read.

770
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:46,125
Oh, thank you.
Please, Dad.

771
00:43:48,285 --> 00:43:49,605
OK.

772
00:43:49,765 --> 00:43:51,245
OK.

773
00:44:04,925 --> 00:44:06,925
Ah, you right?

774
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,725
You all cleansed, are you, mate?

775
00:44:09,885 --> 00:44:12,005
Satan banished?

776
00:44:12,165 --> 00:44:15,365
You gotta burn something now,
or prostrate yourself?

777
00:44:15,525 --> 00:44:18,725
It helped clear my head.
Good, mate.

778
00:44:18,885 --> 00:44:21,285
I'm gonna go call Sally.

779
00:44:22,685 --> 00:44:24,885
Tell her I'm OK.
Alright, mate.

780
00:44:25,045 --> 00:44:26,605
Make your call.

781
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:28,965
Take your time. I'll be here.

782
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,005
Go forth, my son.

783
00:44:31,165 --> 00:44:33,805
Try not to multiply this time.

784
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:56,085
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

785
00:44:56,245 --> 00:44:58,685
It's been Christ knows how long
since my last confession,

786
00:44:58,845 --> 00:45:00,725
and I've been entertaining
some impure thoughts

787
00:45:00,885 --> 00:45:03,125
about a certain choirboy.

788
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:07,085
That's more one for the Marist Brothers,
I think, Cleaver.

789
00:45:07,245 --> 00:45:09,525
That you in there, Frank?

790
00:45:10,965 --> 00:45:13,365
I see your son has
the same genetic compulsion

791
00:45:13,525 --> 00:45:16,365
to confess to a god
that he doesn't believe in.

792
00:45:16,525 --> 00:45:20,245
Yeah, you're a sort of a council tip
for spiritual guilt,

793
00:45:20,405 --> 00:45:21,765
aren't you, Frank?

794
00:45:21,925 --> 00:45:24,005
He's a good one,
that boy of yours, Cleaver.

795
00:45:24,165 --> 00:45:25,565
Take better care of him.

796
00:45:25,725 --> 00:45:27,965
He's struggling, isn't he?

797
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,565
Yet with you
as a role model?

798
00:45:31,925 --> 00:45:33,445
How are things, Cleaver?

799
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:37,685
You still Kirsty's rent boy, or
have you got some new stuff for me?

800
00:45:37,845 --> 00:45:44,445
Well, you know, I think things
might be turning, for the better.

801
00:45:44,605 --> 00:45:46,965
I'm sorry to hear that.

802
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,925
I always look forward to
the odd occasion, hearing from you.

803
00:45:50,085 --> 00:45:52,965
Good to get a man who's
actually done some serious sin.

804
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:57,085
I'm starting to wonder
if you might be right, Frank.

805
00:45:57,245 --> 00:46:01,445
Not about virgin births and
singing pigeons and all that hoo-ha,

806
00:46:01,605 --> 00:46:04,005
but...but, I don't know,

807
00:46:04,165 --> 00:46:08,805
maybe a sort of moral order
to all this madness.

808
00:46:10,405 --> 00:46:12,365
You back a winner recently,
or something?

809
00:46:12,525 --> 00:46:14,285
I think I did, mate.

810
00:46:14,445 --> 00:46:18,165
After all these years of shit and...

811
00:46:19,325 --> 00:46:23,285
..and feeling desperate
and dead inside...

812
00:46:25,605 --> 00:46:27,525
..something might have shifted.

813
00:46:28,845 --> 00:46:32,285
Sounding horribly positive here.

814
00:46:33,885 --> 00:46:35,765
Well, it's like I'm...

815
00:46:38,805 --> 00:46:41,285
I don't know, it's like
I've been given a chance.

816
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:46,565
There's all these people who've had
all these hopes for me along the way,

817
00:46:46,725 --> 00:46:49,605
you know, my...my father
and my ex-wife and...

818
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,485
..and Fuzz and Barney and...

819
00:46:52,645 --> 00:46:57,445
..and...it's like
I can maybe deliver, hey?

820
00:46:59,925 --> 00:47:02,925
Do you reckon
people can change, Frank?

821
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:05,445
Yes, I do.

822
00:47:06,685 --> 00:47:09,725
Be a little wary
of epiphanies, mate.

823
00:47:09,885 --> 00:47:12,925
They have a nasty habit
of disappearing.

824
00:47:13,085 --> 00:47:14,005
Oh, great.

825
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,965
Well, I'm gonna enjoy this one
while it's around,

826
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,765
if that's all the same to you, Frank.

827
00:47:17,925 --> 00:47:19,405
Fine.

828
00:47:20,685 --> 00:47:23,285
Maybe all the shit's
behind me now.

829
00:47:23,445 --> 00:47:25,125
I pray itis.

830
00:47:25,285 --> 00:47:27,005
Yeah. All of it.

831
00:47:27,165 --> 00:47:30,805
I'm like Moses
on the road to Damascus.

832
00:47:30,965 --> 00:47:34,965
Or was it Noah?
One of those guys, I think.

833
00:47:52,525 --> 00:47:55,525
Listen, I'm sorry about
being a prick the other day.

834
00:47:56,725 --> 00:47:58,885
We all have to work for someone,
don't we?

835
00:47:59,045 --> 00:47:59,925
Yeah.

836
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:05,085
Look at me. I'm working for
what used to pass as a political party.

837
00:48:06,205 --> 00:48:09,325
In that golden era where
there were parties and policies,

838
00:48:09,485 --> 00:48:13,765
not just polls and focus groups

839
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:16,805
and an endless procession
of mediocre minds.

840
00:48:18,165 --> 00:48:20,005
Job going well, then?

841
00:48:24,165 --> 00:48:25,885
How's Barney?

842
00:48:33,005 --> 00:48:35,365
Things are not great
at the moment.

843
00:48:37,245 --> 00:48:39,285
I'm very sorry to hear that.

844
00:48:45,645 --> 00:48:48,605
Thank you.
Ah, no, no, no. Thank you.

845
00:48:50,685 --> 00:48:56,165
Well, it all starts tomorrow, folks,
the biggest year of our lives.

846
00:48:56,325 --> 00:49:01,605
And I want to thank you both
for hanging in there with me

847
00:49:01,765 --> 00:49:06,445
and maybe now I can pay back
some of what you've given me.

848
00:49:06,605 --> 00:49:08,245
Thank you both.

849
00:49:08,405 --> 00:49:10,525
To tomorrow.
To tomorrow.

850
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:11,685
Cheers.
Oh.

851
00:49:11,845 --> 00:49:13,965
And in the middle of all this,
to the wedding.

852
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:16,125
Ah, yes. Thank you.

853
00:49:16,285 --> 00:49:19,765
A thousand happinesses
to you and your beloved Bruce.

854
00:49:19,925 --> 00:49:21,805
Yeah, Bevan.

855
00:49:21,965 --> 00:49:23,525
Thank you.
Bevan.

856
00:49:23,685 --> 00:49:25,165
Excuse me.

857
00:49:26,525 --> 00:49:28,405
Ah, yes, Josh.

858
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:31,365
Wants me to quadruple check
a couple of things.

859
00:49:31,525 --> 00:49:35,205
Alright, you two, stay put. Enjoy.

860
00:49:35,365 --> 00:49:40,125
Mm-hm.
I've, uh...settled the bill.

861
00:49:49,245 --> 00:49:52,325
Who was that masked man?

862
00:49:54,285 --> 00:49:56,605
Good old Barney.
Yeah.

863
00:49:56,765 --> 00:49:59,565
He is so...

864
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:02,605
..beautiful

865
00:50:02,765 --> 00:50:07,325
and wonderful,
and he's a generous man.

866
00:50:09,005 --> 00:50:12,565
I've always wanted
to get to know Barney.

867
00:50:12,725 --> 00:50:17,205
Oh. You should. You must.
He really, really likes you.

868
00:50:31,805 --> 00:50:33,285
No.

869
00:50:35,405 --> 00:50:37,525
I can't hurt him again.

870
00:50:39,085 --> 00:50:40,565
No.

871
00:50:42,245 --> 00:50:43,925
No, you mustn't.

872
00:50:45,605 --> 00:50:47,525
He's a wonderful man.

873
00:51:06,685 --> 00:51:08,565
Nuclear attack,

874
00:51:08,725 --> 00:51:10,565
marauding refugees,

875
00:51:10,725 --> 00:51:12,845
avian flu,

876
00:51:13,005 --> 00:51:15,165
Communists in broom closets,

877
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:17,445
white-tailed spiders.

878
00:51:17,605 --> 00:51:20,325
So many things we fear.

879
00:51:25,805 --> 00:51:29,005
Scary, scary women we fear.

880
00:51:31,165 --> 00:51:33,925
..S0 many things we fear,

881
00:51:34,085 --> 00:51:38,445
including, sometimes, the truth.

882
00:51:39,445 --> 00:51:43,365
There is, is there not,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

883
00:51:43,525 --> 00:51:46,405
so much we can learn about ourselves

884
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:50,045
if we have the integrity,
the courage,

885
00:51:50,205 --> 00:51:54,005
to stand up and not only
tell the truth,

886
00:51:54,165 --> 00:51:56,285
but to listen to it.

887
00:51:57,565 --> 00:51:59,805
It has a distinctive ring to it,
the truth,

888
00:51:59,965 --> 00:52:04,245
a purifying timbre
that will not be silenced

889
00:52:04,405 --> 00:52:09,165
even by the monotonous drone
of governments and corporations.

890
00:52:10,965 --> 00:52:16,085
Joshua Floyd has reminded us
that the truth exists

891
00:52:16,245 --> 00:52:22,045
and defines itself
as a function of who we are.

892
00:52:23,285 --> 00:52:27,325
It may be ugly, it may be unwelcome,

893
00:52:27,485 --> 00:52:30,565
and it may be the very last thing
we wish to confront,

894
00:52:30,725 --> 00:52:34,045
but the only way
that we can confront it

895
00:52:34,205 --> 00:52:36,165
is to know it...

896
00:52:37,365 --> 00:52:39,045
..to embrace it.

897
00:52:39,205 --> 00:52:42,205
The only way we can move onward

898
00:52:42,365 --> 00:52:47,485
is to know that which is manifest
about ourselves.

899
00:53:03,045 --> 00:53:05,285
We're due in.

900
00:53:06,965 --> 00:53:09,765
Yep. Absolutely.

901
00:53:13,885 --> 00:53:15,325
I hope you don't...

902
00:53:15,485 --> 00:53:18,405
No. No, not at all.

903
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:20,605
Good.

904
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:23,245
Because, you know... Oh, good.

905
00:53:23,405 --> 00:53:25,965
No, fine. It...

906
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:28,325
Great.
Great.

907
00:53:29,405 --> 00:53:30,885
It was...

908
00:53:32,245 --> 00:53:34,645
It was, yep. Yeah, it was...

909
00:53:42,565 --> 00:53:44,045
Hello?

910
00:53:56,045 --> 00:53:58,725
Have I got the wrong day?
No.

911
00:53:58,885 --> 00:54:00,805
What's going on? Where is everyone?
Where's the press?

912
00:54:00,965 --> 00:54:02,485
Trial of the century.

913
00:54:03,725 --> 00:54:05,165
He's dead.

914
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,805
Who's dead?
Josh.

915
00:54:09,445 --> 00:54:11,085
Murdered last night.

916
00:54:14,565 --> 00:54:16,085
Oh, no.

917
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:24,045
You should know, they've...
taken Missy in for questioning.
