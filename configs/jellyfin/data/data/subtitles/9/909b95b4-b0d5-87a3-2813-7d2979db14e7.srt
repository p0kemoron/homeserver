00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,640
DAVID ATTENBOROUGH:
The deep ocean.

2
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,680
For mammals,

3
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,680
it's one of the most
inhospitable places on Earth.

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,480
BEEPING

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,280
MAN OVER RADIO: Can we move another
camera to channel three? OK.

6
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,960
Anything we've got. Yeah.

7
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,000
BEEPING

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,120
Survival in this alien world...

9
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,840
...requires extreme adaptations.

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,600
We have only recently begun
to explore these depths.

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,840
BEEPING

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,040
So if you're watching on channel
one, the Supersampler is... Yeah.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,760
The heck is that?!

14
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,840
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my goodness, what is that?

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,120
Yet, some mammals
have been coming here

16
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,240
for millions of years.

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,680
It's a sperm whale.

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,880
{\an8}Oh, my goodness.
Look at that shape.

19
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,160
{\an8}WOMAN: Holy cow!

20
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,480
{\an8}Wow!
Unbelievable.

21
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,040
BEEPING

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,000
Like all mammals,
sperm whales breathe air.

23
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,840
Yet, almost a mile underwater,

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,080
in the freezing darkness,

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,600
they seem completely at home.

26
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
They, like many mammals,

27
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,760
have overcome the challenges
of living in water

28
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,520
in the most remarkable ways.

29
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,760
Many mammals, encountering water,

30
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,840
prefer to do no more
than dip their toes into it.

31
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,800
{\an8}Northern Sri Lanka,
late in the dry season.

32
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,240
A troop of macaques

33
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,560
are looking for what little fruit
is left in the forest.

34
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,840
Their search has brought them
to a jungle pool.

35
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,560
But there's more for them here

36
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,560
than just a refreshing drink.

37
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,320
Water lilies.

38
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,920
Enough to fill the empty stomachs
of the entire troop.

39
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,400
But the flowers
are just out of reach.

40
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,680
Got it!

41
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,640
But a single flower
merely whets the appetite.

42
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,360
For the real prize...

43
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,280
...they must take the plunge.

44
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,360
For an animal that spends
nearly all of its time on land,

45
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,440
macaques are surprisingly
competent in water.

46
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,880
They're looking for
the lilies' juicy seed pods...

47
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,960
...which are packed
full of nutrients.

48
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,160
An excellent solution to the
macaques' seasonal food crisis.

49
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,200
LOUD SPLASH

50
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,880
Thanks to their natural curiosity...

51
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,120
...and willingness
to explore new opportunities...

52
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,520
...these macaques have discovered
that it can pay to jump into water.

53
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,120
Freshwater ponds in a jungle
may be few and far between.

54
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,840
In Central Canada, however,

55
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,160
water is everywhere.

56
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,160
Moist soil is easy to dig...

57
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,120
...and just underground

58
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,720
there is a network of tunnels.

59
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,640
The work of a particularly
industrious little mammal.

60
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,280
SNIFFING

61
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,280
A star-nosed mole.

62
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,480
Virtually blind,

63
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,280
he relies on his
super-sensitive nose.

64
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,240
It's not just for smelling.

65
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,640
It's also...

66
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,360
...for feeling.

67
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,000
And it is 100 times more sensitive

68
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,200
than our own fingertips.

69
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,720
To fuel his active lifestyle,

70
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,280
he must eat up to twice
his body weight every day.

71
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,280
And worms, as they burrow,

72
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,160
simply drop into his tunnels
of their own accord.

73
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,680
Life underground can be pretty good.

74
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,000
THUNDER RUMBLES

75
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,120
HEAVY RAINFALL

76
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,160
But every spring,

77
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,240
torrential rain saturates the soil.

78
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,960
Before long,
the mole's tunnels are flooded.

79
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,000
He can hold his breath
for little more than 30 seconds.

80
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,600
He must get out or he'll drown.

81
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,640
Made it!

82
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,920
But having taken a breath...

83
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,840
...he dives straight back in.

84
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,000
Large feet, excellent for digging,

85
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,600
also make very effective paddles.

86
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,920
And his water-resistant coat

87
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,400
keeps him warm...

88
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,280
...so he's well equipped
for swimming.

89
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,960
But, nonetheless, there's a problem.

90
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,360
How do you sniff out prey
underwater?

91
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,240
AIR BLOWS

92
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,000
First, he blows bubbles
into the submerged leaves.

93
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,840
Smells pass into them.

94
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,520
And sniffing them with his nose

95
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,880
enables him to detect
something edible...

96
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,680
...so he can locate possible prey
even underwater.

97
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,800
Star-nosed moles
are one of the few mammals

98
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,640
that are just as at home in the
water as they are in soil.

99
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,480
Beyond land,

100
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,400
the oceans that cover
two-thirds of our planet

101
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,720
are full of possible food.

102
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,240
For most mammals, it's out of reach.

103
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,400
But that doesn't stop some
from trying to get it.

104
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,760
{\an8}A female coyote,

105
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,520
{\an8}patrolling the Pacific coast
of Mexico.

106
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,760
Living on the edge of a desert

107
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,640
means often relying
on the ocean for food.

108
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,480
SEA BIRDS CALL

109
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,400
This female would make a meal
of a sea bird

110
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,480
if only she could catch one.

111
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,120
BIRDS SQUAWK

112
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,840
She can't afford to keep failing.

113
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,960
SEA BIRDS CAW

114
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,520
Driven by hunger, she moves on.

115
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,560
The desert stretches 2,000 miles

116
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,480
along Mexico's Baja coast.

117
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,160
Coyotes living here
are forced to explore

118
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,960
tangled mangroves and deep creeks.

119
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,000
SEA BIRDS CAW

120
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,600
After a long day
under the desert sun,

121
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,320
persistence pays off.

122
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,400
A dead body cast up by the waves.

123
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,320
It's the carcass of a grey whale...

124
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,600
...rotting in the sun.

125
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,560
Enough to feed her for months.

126
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,280
PATTERING

127
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,360
But other hungry beachcombers
have found it, too.

128
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,640
GROWLS

129
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,320
SNARLS

130
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,920
They quarrel over the best bits.

131
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,440
But a 40-tonne whale is more
than enough food to go round.

132
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,400
The daily tides
provide so much food

133
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,720
{\an8}that the Baja's Pacific coastline

134
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,840
{\an8}supports up to 14 times
the number of coyotes

135
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,720
{\an8}than occur inland.

136
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,880
HOWLING

137
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,080
But extending scavenging on shore

138
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
to hunting in the sea

139
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,200
requires very different skills.

140
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,480
Nonetheless, 50 million years ago,

141
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,120
the ancestors of marine mammals

142
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,400
started to do exactly that.

143
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,560
A bottlenose dolphin
and her two young

144
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,960
cruise the shallows of Florida Bay.

145
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,200
The coastal waters here
are full of fish.

146
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,560
But much of the bay
is less than a metre deep.

147
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,400
For a large mammal with a tail
that beats up and down,

148
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,000
just moving around here
is a challenge.

149
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,600
But she has a simple solution.

150
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,240
She swims on her side.

151
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,480
But it's still a struggle
to keep up with a fish.

152
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,360
Let alone catch one.

153
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,080
And a single fish won't feed
a family.

154
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,160
But this intelligent mother
has another,

155
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,640
even more ingenious, solution.

156
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,920
Beating her tail,

157
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
she churns up the water...

158
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,680
...creating a muddy barrier...

159
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,600
...around a shoal of fish.

160
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,800
In a bid to escape...

161
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,640
...the fish are forced...

162
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,040
...to leap.

163
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,160
She's not the only one
that gets a meal.

164
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,880
Her young family can also feed.

165
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,440
But rings of muddy water

166
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,120
aren't the only way in which
dolphins hunt in Florida.

167
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,400
This family uses an S-shaped barrier

168
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,360
to spook the fish.

169
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,640
Why Florida's dolphins
use different shapes

170
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,440
remains a mystery.

171
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,400
But this ingenuity

172
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,880
enables marine mammals

173
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,720
to move far beyond the shallows.

174
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,680
Californian sea lions.

175
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,200
BARKING

176
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,120
They may spend over 70%
of their lives out at sea.

177
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,040
They know the opportunities
offered by the open ocean

178
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,360
are endless.

179
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,960
The trick is how to make
the most of them.

180
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,440
BARKING

181
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,440
The sea lions have spent
a lot of energy to get here,

182
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,160
and the sardines they seek are
widely dispersed beneath them.

183
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,520
The hunters need to round them up.

184
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,080
Striped marlin arrive.

185
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,400
Up to four metres long

186
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,120
and with a deadly spear
on their nose,

187
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,280
they, too, are hunting.

188
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,400
Watched by the sea lions...

189
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,320
...the marlin go to work.

190
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,680
They herd the sardines
into a ball...

191
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,600
...and then drive them
up towards the surface.

192
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,520
This is what the sea lions
have been waiting for.

193
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,040
Fast and flexible,

194
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,480
the sea lions take advantage
of the marlin's efforts...

195
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,040
...and collect an easy meal.

196
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
These canny sea lions

197
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,840
have learnt how to let marlin
do the hard work.

198
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,360
But sea lions don't stay
permanently in water.

199
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,280
The Galapagos Islands.

200
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,600
Specks of land in the vast emptiness
of the Pacific Ocean.

201
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,800
Here, pregnant Galapagos sea lions

202
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,160
haul out on a beach to give birth.

{\an8}Unable to swim
when it's newly born,

207
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,200
{\an8}a pup relies completely
on its mother

208
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,040

PUP WHINES

210
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,840
Within two weeks, thanks to the
richness of this milk,

211
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,840
it will be strong enough
to venture into the water.

212
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,600
But a newborn pup

213
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,120
is something of a shock
to its older brother.

214
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,480
For the last two years,

215
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,880
he's had his mother all to himself.

216
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,920
The new pup is a sure sign

217
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,920
that he must now find his own feet.

A sheltered inlet is a safe place
for pups and other juveniles

220
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,640
to build up their confidence.

221
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,880
Now, under the watchful eye
of a dominant bull...

222
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,440
...the young sea lions acquire
the skills they'll need

223
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,000
for a life at sea.

00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,240
when sea lions also mate.

227
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,920
GRUNTING

228
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,200
While the bull's attention
is elsewhere...

229
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,960
...the pup ventures beyond
the safety of the rock pool.

230
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,640
It's a mistake.

231
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,320
The waters surrounding the Galapagos

232
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,480
are patrolled by sharks.

233
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,600
The pup strays further
from the pool...

234
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,880
...while the bull is preoccupied.

235
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,280
The pup can outmanoeuvre
the shark...

236
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,960
...but not for long.

237
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,360
Alerted by the commotion...

238
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,120
...the bull takes action.

239
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,600
Weighing a quarter of a tonne,

240
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,200
the bull is more than a match
for the shark.

241
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,000
Biting at its tail,

242
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,560
he chases it away.

243
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,800
For the pup, it's an important
lesson learned.

00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,320
BLEATS

245
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,080

...are less fortunate.

247
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,400
Nearly half of these young sea lions

248
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,440
will not survive beyond
their second birthday.

249
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,840
This pup is safely back on land,

250
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,840
and not too old
for a reassuring cuddle.

251
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,520
GRUNTS SOFTLY

252
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,440
One small group of mammals, however,

253
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,680
have completely cut their ties
with the land.

254
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,360
WHALE SONG

255
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,720
Humpback whale calves can swim
from the moment they're born.

256
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,000
The warm coastal shallows
off Western Australia

257
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,400
provide excellent nurseries.

258
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,920
In their first few days,

259
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,320
mothers and babies
form a strong bond.

260
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,160
Tucked gently under her fin,

261
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,120
this mother gives her daughter

262
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,120
an early lesson
in holding its breath.

263
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,720
But they won't stay here for long.

264
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,680
The reef may be an excellent
place to give birth...

265
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,560
...but there's almost
nothing to eat here...

266
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,680
...so mothers and young

267
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,360
must now make the long journey
to richer waters around Antarctica.

268
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,280
But once they've left the safety
of the shallow reef

269
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,640
they are vulnerable.

270
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,120
A pod of orca...

271
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,160
...six strong,
patrols the migration route.

272
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,040
They are a formidable force.

273
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,520
But the humpback mother
puts her baby high on her back

274
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,840
to protect it...

275
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,640
...and then goes on
the attack herself.

276
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,520
Slashing her powerful tail

277
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,680
and long five-metre fins,

278
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,960
she could easily kill an orca.

279
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,120
But the orca have a plan.

280
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,040
Some of the pod distract
the mother...

281
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,680
...while others ram the calf.

282
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,680
Once it's separated...

283
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,440
...they drown it.

284
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,200
Since 1986,

285
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,560
when commercial whaling
was largely banned,

286
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,840
humpback numbers have risen here
from a few hundred

287
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,880
to more than 35,000.

288
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,720
With so many calves on the move,

289
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,920
some orca have specialised
in hunting them.

290
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,080
A small pod - just three.

291
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,160
The humpback calf they're pursuing

292
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,360
has more than just its mother
at its side.

293
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,040
It also has...

294
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,400
...a 40-tonne male.

295
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,480
This is a much bigger challenge.

296
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,160
But rather than give up...

297
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,440
...the orca bide their time.

298
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,240
The male humpback,

299
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,760
believing, perhaps,
that the orca have gone...

300
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,320
...now dives.

301
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,560
The killers seize their opportunity.

302
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,040
They kidnap the calf.

303
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,440
{\an8}They appear to mimic
the mother's behaviour,

304
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,640
{\an8}putting the young calf
on their backs

305
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,400
and carrying him along
in the slipstream.

306
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,040
Young and naive,

307
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,800
the calf goes willingly with them.

308
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,680
Now, far from his mother...

309
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,800
...the orca attack him.

310
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,600
During the months of migration,

311
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,160
the pod may kill as many
as five calves a day.

312
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,320
They catch so many

313
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,920
that sometimes they eat
no more than the tongue...

314
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,760
{\an8}...and leave the rest
for the sharks.

315
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,800
This is what can happen

316
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,200
when prey is so abundant

317
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,000
and hunters have such skill.

318
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,360
False killer whales are less
than half the size of orcas...

319
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,240
...but they are equally clever.

320
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,360
They roam the ocean in groups
up to 50 strong.

321
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,760
Right now, they're on the hunt
for other mammals.

322
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,680
HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAKING

323
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,840
Ocean-going bottlenose dolphins.

324
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,640
But the false killers
aren't looking for prey.

325
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,240
These two groups
are old acquaintances.

326
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,120
In the waters around New Zealand,

327
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,960
they are almost always found
together.

328
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,240
{\an8}Lifelong bonds within species
are common...

329
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,800
...but they are rarely seen
between different species.

330
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,800
Such friendships

331
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,160
between bottlenose dolphins
and false killers...

332
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,280
...have been documented
going back 20 years...

333
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,480
...so it's entirely possible
that individuals of both species

334
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,520
recognise each other.

335
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,280
They team up not only to play...

336
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,160
...but in order to hunt.

337
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,080
So, when one goes...

338
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,680
...they all go.

339
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,280
A huge school of kahawai fish.

340
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,440
The false killers
swim under the shoal...

341
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
...and drive it to the surface.

342
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,480
Here, the dolphins attack.

343
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,320
But despite helping,

344
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,320
the whales don't appear to feed.

345
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,560
For them,
the kahawai are just the bait.

346
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,600
The false killers know the commotion
will attract bigger fish.

347
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,920
Kingfish arrive.

348
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,000
They're up to ten times heavier
than the kahawai,

349
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,920
and one metre long.

350
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,200
Too big for the dolphins.

351
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,280
So, now it's the turn of the false
killer whales to feed.

352
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,440
They form small groups

353
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,040
and break up the school...

354
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,160
...and then go after the fish
that get separated.

355
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,200
Not all the whales make a catch.

356
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,680
But they won't go hungry.

357
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,120
Extraordinarily, the successful
hunters share their food.

358
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,680
By helping one another...

359
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,040
...they ensure that no-one
goes without.

360
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,480
Teamwork, intelligence
and cooperation

361
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,280
has enabled marine mammals
to flourish in the high seas.

362
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,880
But one part of the ocean is still
beyond the reach of most.

363
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,960
The deep.

364
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,840
Only a very few are capable
of venturing here.

365
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,760
A pod of sperm whales resting
near the surface.

366
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,840
They spend just 7%
of their lives asleep,

367
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,400
less than almost any other mammal.

368
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,840
But they're also waiting here

369
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,280
for another very special reason.

370
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,200
The birth of a baby.

371
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,840
CLICKING

372
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,160
Helped into the world
by supportive relatives,

373
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,040
the newborn is already
more than three metres long.

374
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,000
It will grow up surrounded
and protected by close family.

375
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,520
It thirsts for its mother's milk,

376
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,040
but the food the mother needs
in order to produce it

377
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,360
is 1,000 metres below,

378
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,880
far beyond the reach
of a young calf.

379
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,800
So, whilst the family
looks after the newborn...

380
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,560
...the mother sets off
in search of a meal.

381
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,440
Adult sperm whales may remain below,

382
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,720
holding their breath, for an hour.

383
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,040
As they descend, their bodies
change in an astonishing way.

384
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,080
The increasing pressure
squeezes their lungs

385
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:22,520
until they collapse completely.

386
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,440
To save oxygen,

387
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,200
their digestion,
kidney and liver shut down.

388
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,880
{\an8}A special camera records
a rare and privileged view

389
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,040
{\an8}of a hunting sperm whale,

390
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,120
{\an8}sending out a stream of clicks

391
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,640
{\an8}to detect prey
in the pitch blackness.

392
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,240
CLICKING

393
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,960
{\an8}At this depth, they start
to hunt for giant squid.

394
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,680
{\an8}As the whale closes in,

395
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,720
{\an8}their clicks speed up.

396
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,840
RAPID CLICKING

397
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,560
{\an8}A puff of ink is released
by the fleeing squid,

398
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,600
{\an8}but the sperm whale isn't fooled...

399
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,520
{\an8}...and the squid is eaten
in a last cloud of ink.

400
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,720
As this mother returns,

401
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,360
her calf, like all mammal babies,

402
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,320
has only one thing on its mind.

403
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,640
Milk.

404
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,680
It's growing faster now

405
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,480
than during its 16 months
in the womb.

406
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,080
And it will consume
up to 100 litres,

407
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,640
300,000 calories,

408
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,640
every day for the next two years.

409
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,960
To meet this demand,

410
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,720
its mother will have to dive
up to 15 times every day.

411
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,480
It is her ability to reach
such extreme depths

412
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,960
and turn what she eats
into rich milk

413
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,160
that will be the key
to her baby's success.

414
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,400
Today,

415
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,800
protected almost worldwide,

416
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,880
the outlook for this mother
and baby,

417
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,160
and all sperm whales,

418
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,640
is bright.

419
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,960
Even so, sperm whales
still face many threats.

420
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,320
Every year, enough fishing line
is lost in our oceans

421
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,560
to stretch to the moon and back...

422
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,400
...together with 20 million traps,

423
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,600
and carrying 14 billion hooks.

424
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,000
The whales become entangled
in these so-called "ghost nets".

425
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,520
The lines cut into their bodies...

426
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,440
...and the floats can prevent them
from diving.

427
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,240
Theirs is a slow
and agonising death.

428
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,600
We are now aware
of the threats we create.

429
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,800
Surely, we should now do everything
we can to prevent them.

430
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,120
The greatest challenge
for the Mammals team

431
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,480
was not only filming false
killer whales in New Zealand,

432
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,640
but trying for the first time

433
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,560
to place a data-recording
camera onto one.

434
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:58,200
With only 150 individuals somewhere
within 4,500 square miles,

435
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,000
just finding them
will be hard enough.

436
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,960
Luckily, they have the help
of Jochen Zaeschmar,

437
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,080
who has been studying
this group of whales

438
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,800
for the last 20 years.

439
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,200
He has a directional hydrophone,

440
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,400
with which he can hear the false
killer whales' whistles...

441
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,520
...but only from less
than ten miles away.

442
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,600
Nothing.

443
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,720
I was kind of hoping...
kind of hoping to hear something.

444
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,680
Cameraman Andre Rerekura
scans the horizon,

445
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,840
but picking out a fin in the open
ocean is no small feat.

446
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,520
The scale of the task ahead

447
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,760
is dawning on assistant producer
Kyle Swann.

448
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,760
Searching.
Searching, searching.

449
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,360
That's kind of the strategy,

450
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,520
but so far, no luck.

451
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,640
With only a brief few weeks

452
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,120
during which it's possible
to film them,

453
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,200
it's a disappointing start.

454
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,960
There's absolutely nothing.

455
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:09,600
Over the coming days,
the team search without pause.

456
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,720
Nothing.

457
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,240
Absolutely nothing.

458
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,520
Nothing again.

459
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,080
Still, keep trying.

460
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,000
They have spent 20 days
with no whales...

461
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,640
...but Andre spots something
promising in the distance.

462
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:37,600
There's a few birds,
but nothing crazy.

463
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,360
Yeah, well, that's where I heard
some faint whistles there.

464
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,600
Worth a look while we're here.

465
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,480
Ah, I've got something!

466
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,120
Whoa! We have a haul.
Oh, my God, yeah.

467
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,720
It's promising.
It looks...

468
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,280
I've seen a stumpy nose!

469
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,560
I think we've got falsies!

470
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,600
Whoa!
Falsies!

471
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,800
No way! Woohoo!

472
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,960
We have 'em!

473
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,760
HE LAUGHS

474
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,760
But with the sun setting

475
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,000
and the whales capable
of covering 100 miles a day,

476
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,720
the team hop on their liveaboard

477
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,000
to follow the whales overnight.

478
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,680
The crew takes turns on watch,

479
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,040
using their eyes and ears.

480
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,040
ANDRE: Yeah, we've pretty much
done circles all night.

481
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,280
We're in the same spot we found
them yesterday afternoon,

482
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,920
so they don't go far.

483
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,880
Like Jochen says, they just sleep.

484
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,480
So they've probably had
more sleep than us!

485
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,960
Falsies off the bow!
Big old falsies off the bow.

486
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,760
Woohoo-hoo!
There's one just here.

487
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,240
Oh, my God,
this is just amazing.

488
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,160
They're in a good mood.

489
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,080
A new dawn presents a new challenge.

490
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,840
Back on the filming boat,

491
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,280
the team follow the false killers
as they hunt.

492
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,400
No-one has ever recorded them
creating a bait ball before.

493
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,440
But the whales can swim at 20mph,

494
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,280
so Andre has brought
a little extra propulsion.

495
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,600
ANDRE: The scooter's a game-changer.

496
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,880
You can free-dive down with,
you know, a full lung of air,

497
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,280
all your energy,

498
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,560
and hold your breath for a minute
and a half to two minutes with ease.

499
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,800
The scooter lets him
keep up with false killers

500
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,640
and helps propel him swiftly
into the heart of the action.

501
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,840
Once the feeding frenzy is over,

502
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,640
the whales turn their attention
to Andre.

503
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,800
ANDRE: This incredible interaction.

504
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,800
It just... just made me
realise how amazing

505
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,760
and intelligent these animals are.

506
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,000
CLICKING

507
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,160
It was really unique
and really special.

508
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,560
That was... Woo!

509
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,400
I can't even explain that!

510
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,000
Having captured
this extraordinary behaviour,

511
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,400
the team switch to the most
difficult goal of the trip...

512
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,680
...to place a suction tag on a whale.

513
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,800
For 20 years,
Jochen has studied this group

514
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,680
of false killer whales,

515
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,560
but this would be a first.

516
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,480
The tag contains a camera
and a data collector.

517
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,800
Combined, they will give Jochen
new insights

518
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,360
into how these animals
spend their time underwater.

519
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,200
Getting close enough to attach a tag

520
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,960
will take every ounce of Jochen's
expertise and understanding.

521
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,760
Here they are.

522
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,240
While they're just chilled,
I'll just go in there real slow.

523
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,600
Hope to... Hope to get lucky.

524
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,720
OK, OK, OK, OK.

525
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,840
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful.

526
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,240
OK.
No, no, no.

527
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,760
No. No, no, on the next one,
on the next one.

528
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,840
They're going down a bit.
We'll get them, we'll get them.

529
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,160
Trying to find
that perfect moment!

530
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,160
Heart's going through the roof!

531
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,200
JOCHEN: This is a bunch
of different males.

532
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,080
Let's see, though,
see how they like us.

533
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,560
They're all coming together now.

534
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,240
There's just so, so many factors.

535
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,160
The way the angle of the camera is,

536
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,200
where it comes up next to you.

537
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,320
I'm hopeful. It's hard work.

538
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,120
They're not making it easy.

539
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,800
As the wind drops,

540
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,600
the team have a brief
but perfect opportunity.

541
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,400
JOCHEN: So I'm just going to...

542
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,120
...ease my way over towards them.

543
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,360
Wait.

544
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,840
OK, this is it.

545
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,920
Yeah!
We did it! We did it!

546
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,400
We did it!

547
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:51,320
THEY LAUGH

548
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,560
Well done!

549
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,600
Woooo!

550
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,560
We did it. We did it!
I'm so happy!

551
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,200
THEY CHEER

552
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,080
It's not just the achievement
of getting the tag on,

553
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,960
it's the promise
of what it will reveal.

554
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,840
{\an8}And that turns out
to be astounding.

555
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,920
Intimate food sharing

556
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,760
and new hunting strategies

557
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,000
have been recorded
for the very first time,

558
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,440
giving us a new perspective
on mammals' lives underwater.

559
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,600
Next time -
we venture into the cold.

560
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,480
A vast and unforgiving world...

561
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,280
BARKING AND GROWLING

562
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,160
...where mammals,
through sheer tenacity

563
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,160
and adapation...

564
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,680
...have found a way to make it home.
