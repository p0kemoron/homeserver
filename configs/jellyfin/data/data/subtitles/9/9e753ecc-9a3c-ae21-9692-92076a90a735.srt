1
00:00:38,285 --> 00:00:42,325
Jen, it seems JM Doolan's memoir,
‘A Thousand Lies I Have Told',

2
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:45,085
which records the author's life
as a high-class prostitute,

3
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,605
has sent shock waves through
both Macquarie and Phillip streets.

4
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:51,765
Do you have any insights into

5
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:53,845
JM Doolan's book,
‘A Thousand Lies I Have Told'?

6
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:56,685
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

7
00:00:56,845 --> 00:00:58,885
Oh, God!

8
00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:01,285
Craig Frasier was
so Catholic and guilt-ridden,

9
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:03,325
he always wept after intercourse.

10
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:05,605
Excuse me, Minister,
do you have any insight

11
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,965
into JM Doolan's book,
‘A Thousand Lies I Have Told'?

12
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,485
I've never heard of it.

13
00:01:09,645 --> 00:01:11,725
Surely you must have heard of it...
No, not at all.

14
00:01:13,085 --> 00:01:16,525
Nothing excited Marcus Wardell
more than wearing nappies.

15
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:20,205
Mr Justice O'Shea liked
fo be locked in a confined space

16
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:21,685
while wearing a latex hood.

17
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:23,205
Well, maybe it's your fault!

18
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:24,965
Milo Markley had a tiny dick,

19
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,365
and this curse filled him
with an unrelenting rage.

20
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:28,845
Clearly it's a good time.

21
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:32,845
Francine Pritchard took to hiding
a dildo under her judicial robes.

22
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:36,525
She used it in order to stay awake
during complex commercial trials.

23
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:40,925
Damien Chambers was not a client.

24
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:44,445
I saw him as someone
I ought to be in love with.

25
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:49,725
I saw him as a way out,
not only out of my life, as it was,

26
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:52,685
but also out of the lure
of Mitchell Browne.

27
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:55,685
Mitchell was mercurial.

28
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:57,965
He was a lightning rod for madness.

29
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,245
Brilliant. Chaotic.

30
00:02:00,405 --> 00:02:03,605
A dream and a nightmare.

31
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:08,365
All the blessings of a glad father
compass thee about!

32
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:13,805
Arise and say how they cam'st here.

33
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:16,325
How beauteous mankind is!

34
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:21,285
Oh, brave new world
that hath such people in it!

35
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:25,125
I said ‘virgin'.

36
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:32,845
So happy you enjoyed it.
Thanks for coming.

37
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:34,325
Highness.

38
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:36,925
Oh, you're too kind.
Indeed I am.

39
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:39,845
You were the one snoring, right?
No.

40
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:43,925
Mmm.
Oh, mate, that is a stinker.

41
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:45,405
Really?

42
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:48,125
Apart from you.

43
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:50,725
You are great, you're...

44
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:52,325
And who'd dare to say

45
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:55,205
that you couldn't still play 15
so effectively?

46
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:56,845
Ivan.

47
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:03,325
Cleaver, I'd like you to meet
our illustrious director and star,

48
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:04,405
Ivan Yermolinsky.

49
00:03:04,565 --> 00:03:07,005
Do svidanya.
Yes, it's great to meet you.

50
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:09,725
Listen, I don't wanna stay
at this shit party.

51
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:11,925
Let's just go back to the hotel.
Ivan, people wanna meet you.

52
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:14,445
They wanna congratulate you.
For what? This fucking play?

53
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:16,365
Jesus, piece of shit Shakespeare.

54
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:18,005
Oh, Shakespeare.

55
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,325
Third time this week
the big dryer has broken down

56
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:22,885
before it consumes Caliban.

57
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:25,885
Honestly, do you really think
the problem with this show

58
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,565
is the big dryer breaking down?

59
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:29,765
Cleaver.
Yes, yes. The fuckin' big dryer!

60
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:33,165
May we interrupt?
Ladies. How are you?

61
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:35,565
Such a thrill to see you, Charlotte.

62
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:38,365
Did you enjoy the show, ladies?
Oh, yes, very much.

63
00:03:38,525 --> 00:03:40,005
Oh, you did? There you are.

64
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:41,925
There you go, Charles, maybe it's not

65
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:44,485
the worst production of Shakespeare
in recorded history.

66
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:46,125
What would you fucking know?
Ivan.

67
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:49,645
Well, I know enough to know
that “The Tempest'

68
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:54,925
is Shakespeare's final great testament
to life and imagination.

69
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:57,405
And that instead of setting it
on an Aegean island,

70
00:03:57,565 --> 00:03:59,645
you've popped it into
a laundromat in Potts Point,

71
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:01,485
in which there's a spin dryer that,

72
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:03,285
for reasons probably
unknown to the author,

73
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:05,365
is also some sort
of a time machine.

74
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:06,885
Cleaver, enough.

75
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,605
I mean, what's next, mate?

76
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:11,405
‘Hamlet' in a radiology clinic
on the Gold Coast?

77
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:13,445
Oh, oh, Ivan!
Let me go!

78
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:14,685
“The Merchant of Indooroopilly'?

79
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:16,525
Ladies, let me introduce you
to our other cast.

80
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:18,405
Come on.
‘Two Gentlemen of Wodonga'?

81
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:20,965
- Let me go.
- Go home.

82
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:26,965
You know, you're right.

83
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,525
It was complete shit.

84
00:04:30,805 --> 00:04:34,805
Cleaver Greene, at your service.

85
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:51,965
How many?

86
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,245
I don't know. I haven't counted.

87
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:58,245
50? 1007?
Yeah, 100 sounds about right.

88
00:04:58,405 --> 00:05:00,005
100 murders?

89
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:01,525
Wow.

90
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:06,285
How many have you got off?
My average is 51%.

91
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:09,565
That doesn't sound
very impressive, Mr Greene.

92
00:05:09,725 --> 00:05:13,045
Not until you realise
99% of my clients are guilty.

93
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:18,085
My friend Emily and I are making
a short film for Tropfest.

94
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:20,805
It's about a couple of girls
who get away with murder,

95
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:23,405
sort of Hitchcock meets Polanski.

96
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:26,725
Oh, yes, so a feelgood story,
is it, then?

97
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:31,245
Jesus. Sartre. Heraclitus. Nietzsche.

98
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:33,125
You love your
light reading, don't you?

99
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:36,205
What can I say?
I'm a sucker for a nihilist.

100
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:37,885
Breakfast, darling.

101
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:39,485
Thanks, Mum.

102
00:05:39,645 --> 00:05:42,765
Was that your mother?
Yeah.

103
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,045
Right. Right.

104
00:05:45,205 --> 00:05:48,445
It's OK, she's cool.
OK.

105
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:52,765
I'm sure she is, but
it's not really a good look, is it?

106
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:08,165
Why have you got pictures
of Charlotte Gardyne

107
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:09,645
all around the place?

108
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:11,285
Well, she's my aunt.

109
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:14,725
Aunt, right.

110
00:06:14,885 --> 00:06:17,085
So that's why you were
at the theatre last night.

111
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:19,965
How else do you think
I got opening night tickets?

112
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,685
Michelle.

113
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:24,245
You're her niece, Michelle.

114
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:27,405
Jesus wept.
I was at your christening.

115
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:30,285
Michelle, how old are you?

116
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:33,245
How old do you think I am?

117
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,845
23.
I'll be 16 in a couple of months.

118
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:44,805
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

119
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:47,125
Don't worry.
You'll be invited to the party.

120
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:48,605
Oh, my God.

121
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:51,365
Oh, Jesus, I didn't even think.
I swear to God.

122
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:54,245
God. Cleaver,
you're not the first.

123
00:06:54,405 --> 00:06:56,485
And besides, I invited you
back here, remember?

124
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:58,565
No, they'll be cool.
How can they be cool?

125
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:00,885
How can anyone be cool?
This is not... This is...

126
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,525
They shouldn't be cool.
It's a deeply heated situation.

127
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:12,205
Fuck.

128
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,085
Fuck. Fuck.

129
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:17,085
Fuck!

130
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:20,085
Taxi!

131
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:26,965
Hello? Baz.

132
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,085
No, listen, mate,
now's not a good time.

133
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:31,805
Really?

134
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:35,485
Who's the trainer? Oh, yeah?

135
00:07:35,645 --> 00:07:36,725
OK.

136
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:40,165
They're approaching
the bend, around the home turn,

137
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:43,645
and Canard Mort is leaving
the rest of the field for dead.

138
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:49,005
This 2-year-old, 120-to-1 rank outsider
is streaking to a massive win...

139
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:50,485
Come on!
..In her first outing.

140
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:52,045
Oh, come on!
12, 13 lengths now.

141
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,165
This is surely
the win of the carnival.

142
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:55,685
When did we last see
a performance...

143
00:07:55,845 --> 00:07:57,645
Oh, yes! Yes!
..as impressive is this?

144
00:07:57,805 --> 00:08:00,205
Yes!
Oh! Oh, no! She's lost her jockey.

145
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:02,925
The veteran David Elliott
has fallen off Canard Mort.

146
00:08:03,085 --> 00:08:05,885
Dear God, the other riders
are trying to avoid Elliott,

147
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:08,645
and Canard Mort herself
has come to a complete halt.

148
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,125
Oh, what a tragedy.

149
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:12,965
Let's just hope there's a future left
for this plucky beast,

150
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,805
but, dear, oh, dear,
you've gotta fear the worst.

151
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:19,845
Did you know ‘canard mort'
is French for ‘dead duck'?

152
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:21,605
I do now.

153
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:24,085
Come on, mate, a quick beating's
a good beating.

154
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:26,285
You're 200 in the hole
already, Cleave.

155
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:28,165
It's more than a beating, mate.

156
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:32,445
You know, I read about this bloke
who lost an eye at work,

157
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:34,165
got 100 grand payout.

158
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:37,565
Apparently there's this schedule
the insurance boys have got,

159
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:41,005
tell you how much an eye's worth,
oran arm, or a leg...

160
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:43,485
Col...
My question is this.

161
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:46,925
If one eye is worth 100 grand,

162
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:50,245
are both eyes worth two?

163
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,605
OK, you're freaking me out.

164
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,085
Boss wants to have a word.

165
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:58,365
If I was you, I would
pull out all the stops.

166
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:01,925
Kirsty.
Hey, Cleaver.

167
00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:04,045
How lovely to see you.
Yeah.

168
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:05,645
It's been too long.
Yeah, yeah.

169
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:08,365
Shall we walk?
What a lovely idea.

170
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:14,365
You've put me in
a tricky position, Cleave.

171
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:17,925
200 grand's a lot of money.

172
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:21,125
And I don't wanna
have to hurt you, you know,

173
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:22,845
but I've got a reputation
to maintain.

174
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:25,405
I can't be seen
to be being weak, right?

175
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,685
No, no. God, no.

176
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:29,325
The thing is, you were so kind to me
during Mick's trial,

177
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,045
and I've never forgotten that.

178
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:34,285
Truth is...

179
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:39,125
..I-I think about that, a lot.

180
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:41,765
Do you?
Mm-hm.

181
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:44,085
Oh, that's lovely.

182
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:46,525
So I don't wanna make
any hasty decisions.

183
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:50,045
No, no. God, y... No, no.

184
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:57,045
I was wondering
if you would be interested

185
00:09:57,205 --> 00:10:02,445
in coming and having a bite...
to eat with me...one time.

186
00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:06,245
You know,
that's a funny thing,

187
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,405
because I'm going to
a party tonight

188
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:11,765
and I was asked if I'd like
to bring someone.

189
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:14,085
Would you like to come?
Love to.

190
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:16,245
That's great. OK.

191
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:19,405
Um, I'll pick you up at 7:00.

192
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:21,245
Wonderful.

193
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:22,725
Ooh.

194
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:25,725
I should take this, sorry.
OK.

195
00:10:28,205 --> 00:10:29,205
Yep?

196
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:33,605
What'd I tell you?
What did I fucking tell you?!

197
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:36,565
No, no, that is the wrong answer.

198
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:39,725
Listen, you tell him
if he doesn't deliver by Friday,

199
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:42,045
he's not gonna enjoy
waking up Saturday morning,

200
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:43,845
if he wakes up Saturday,
you hear me?

201
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:50,725
And, cut.

202
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:55,445
That was really, really good.
It looks great.

203
00:11:59,765 --> 00:12:02,245
Oh, my...

204
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:11,365
Just out there.

205
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:20,845
So, what brand of bloody and bizarre
have we got here?

206
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:22,965
Movie shoot gone seriously wrong.

207
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,325
- They're just schoolkids. Barely 16.
- Get me some shots with this.

208
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:28,485
Grollo, you done
with the knife?

209
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:30,965
Grollo.
Love.

210
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:35,005
Stunt knife.
Use 'em all the time in movies.

211
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:38,045
Press this little button here,
blade retracts with pressure.

212
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:40,805
Release the button,
it's a normal knife.

213
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:44,285
Where do two schoolgirls
get a hold of that?

214
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:45,965
There's nothing you can't
find online these days.

215
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,645
Friend of mine got a bazooka
off eBay once.

216
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,685
Why am I not surprised?

00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:27,725
You know, the last year's
been...been really tricky,

227
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:31,085
what with taking over
Mick's business and everything.

228
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:35,645
And I really...l didn't think
I had it in me, you know?

229
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:38,965
I really...God,
I really didn't think

230
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,445
that I could have
someone's legs broken.

231
00:13:44,445 --> 00:13:46,445
But after the first few,
it's...

232
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:48,045
Yeah.

233
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:50,605
Well, you've gotta love your work.
Yeah.

234
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:52,125
Yeah.

235
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:55,965
Look, thank you for...

236
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,325
..a f-f-fantastic night.

237
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:01,605
You had a good time, didn't you?
I had a great night.

238
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:03,245
Yeah.

239
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:09,365
Well...goodnight.
You know it's still early.

240
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:13,045
I guess itis.

241
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:30,485
You did what?
You heard me.

242
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:33,045
You rooted Mick's wife?

243
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,725
Are you out of your mind?

244
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:38,725
Mate, I had no choice. I'm 200 down.

245
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:42,045
There was talk of blinding.
I don't know how to play this one.

246
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:43,965
I'm not surprised.

247
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,365
You free for lunch?
No, Cleave.

248
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:49,085
I'm not gonna see you.
..back to Australia.

249
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:52,605
Barn, I... Come on.
This is serious shit.

250
00:14:52,765 --> 00:14:56,525
This is exactly the sort of shit
I don't want to be a part of anymore.

251
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:59,605
Look, I need a mate, alright?

252
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,885
I hated going behind Scarlet's back
on that Fenton thing.

253
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:05,045
I can't do it anymore.

254
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:08,165
Mate, I'm not asking you
to go behind her back.

255
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,725
I'm just asking you
to have a bloody drink.

256
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:13,165
They are the same thing, Cleave.

257
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:17,605
So no more drinks,
no more lunches, no more cases.

258
00:15:17,765 --> 00:15:21,205
Do you understand? Goodbye.

259
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:24,405
In other news,

260
00:15:24,565 --> 00:15:26,245
two schoolgirls face charges
of manslaughter

261
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:29,325
after a tragic accident
whilst shooting a short film.

262
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:32,805
Police have confirmed that
an 18-year-old man was stabbed to death

263
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,125
after a so-called stunt turned deadly.

264
00:15:35,285 --> 00:15:36,725
The girls, who both attend

265
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:38,485
the prestigious private school
Kelly House,

266
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:40,085
appeared to be in shock...

267
00:15:40,245 --> 00:15:42,365
..as they were taken away by police
for questioning.

268
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,565
Kelly House released a statement
early this morning,

269
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:47,005
which did not comment specifically
on last night's event...

270
00:15:47,165 --> 00:15:48,165
Charles.

271
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,325
Oh, Charles.

272
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:55,925
Come on. Come on, it's alright.

273
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:59,605
It's gonna be alright.
It'll be alright.

274
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:01,845
It'll be fine.

275
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:04,205
We need you, Cleave.

276
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:08,805
Yeah, listen, anything I can do to help,
anything, I-I'll be there.

277
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:10,485
So you'll defend Michelle?

278
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,925
I meant anything
in an abstract sense.

279
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:17,565
What?

280
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:21,245
Well, I-l can't... mean,
I'm too close to y-y-...

281
00:16:21,405 --> 00:16:23,085
I'm too close to you, I'm too...

282
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:24,685
[-'m emotionally involved,
so I can't...

283
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:26,205
But that's exactly what we want,

284
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:28,005
someone we know
will be in our corner.

285
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:32,325
Oh...
This isn't about money, is it?

286
00:16:32,485 --> 00:16:34,965
I mean, we're not asking
for a freebie, if that's it.

287
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,445
No. No.

288
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:38,325
It's...
Well, then, what is it?

289
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:42,525
I-I've been there for you, Cleaver,
at some of your darkest moments.

290
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:44,045
Yeah, yeah.

291
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:47,365
I need you now.
My niece needs you now.

292
00:16:47,525 --> 00:16:50,885
It was one of the first things
she asked for after they charged her.

293
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:51,885
What was?

294
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:55,045
She said, “I want Cleaver Greene
to defend me.”

295
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:03,925
They're here, Cleave.

296
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:07,045
Fine. Show 'em in.

297
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:14,005
Michelle.
Hey, Cleaver.

298
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:18,005
Lovely to see you, despite
the unfortunate circumstances.

299
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:20,085
Charles.

300
00:17:20,245 --> 00:17:23,845
Cleaver, you've met my sister, Caroline,
and her husband, Ted.

301
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:25,085
Yes. Hi.
Hi.

302
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,965
It's been a while.

303
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,605
Please.

304
00:17:31,805 --> 00:17:36,245
This is my instructing solicitor,
Lincoln Lincoln.

305
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:37,885
Ms Gardyne.

306
00:17:38,045 --> 00:17:40,005
It's an honour.

307
00:17:40,165 --> 00:17:41,645
I'm a huge fan.

308
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:43,725
I must have seen
‘A Day's Remembrance'...

309
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,125
..12 times.

310
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:51,165
Alright. Marvellous.
Could we get on with it now?

311
00:17:56,645 --> 00:18:00,605
I don't know now.
I'm not sure of anything.

312
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:04,045
I thought I'd pushed the button in.

313
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:06,685
Em says she thought
she pushed it in.

314
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:11,005
So, um, if Em pushed it in,
I may have released it.

315
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:12,805
Cleaver, is this really necessary?

316
00:18:12,965 --> 00:18:15,845
Uh, look, we're gonna have to
put Michelle in the box,

317
00:18:16,005 --> 00:18:18,085
and she'll face
tougher questions than this.

318
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:20,245
But she's just an actor, Cleaver.

319
00:18:20,405 --> 00:18:21,925
She isn't the one
that bought the knife.

320
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:23,925
But she is the one
that we have on film

321
00:18:24,085 --> 00:18:25,845
plunging it through
the deceased's ribs.

322
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,325
She's a child.

323
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:30,565
Be that as it may, Ted, um,
the charge is manslaughter —

324
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:32,565
she's being tried as an adult.

325
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:42,165
Look, we'll adjourn
for the day there, OK?

326
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:45,605
Oh, um, uh, Ms Gardyne?

327
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:48,365
If you don't mind,
can I just grab a quick...?

328
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:51,005
Cleave, could you? If you just
press...just press the button...

329
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:52,325
It's not...
No, mate.

330
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:54,565
The lenses these days are amazing.
You just keep pressing the button.

331
00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:56,405
Thank you. Thank you.

332
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:58,805
Just press...

333
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:06,565
Thank you. Thank you.

334
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:09,005
Can I just... Oh.

335
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,805
Hi.

336
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,565
Fuck. What are you doing?

337
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:22,765
I thought we could use
a moment alone.

338
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:24,485
I've been thinking about you.

339
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:27,085
Where are your parents?
In reception, waiting for me.

340
00:19:27,245 --> 00:19:28,565
Are you crazy?

341
00:19:28,725 --> 00:19:31,285
Take a breath, Cleave.
Everything's cool.

342
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:33,565
No, everything is not cool.

343
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:37,165
You told me you and Emily
were making a film

344
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:39,725
about two girls
who get away with murder.

345
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:44,005
What can I say?

346
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:47,645
Life imitates art.

347
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:56,445
I'll call you later, gorgeous.

348
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:11,885
“Back in 20 minutes.”

349
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,845
I hate “back in 20 minutes”.
What does it even mean?

350
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,325
What does it mean?

351
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:19,445
See, we don't know if he's been gone
for 1 minute, he's back in 19,

352
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:22,325
or if he's been gone for 19 minutes
and back in 1.

353
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:24,525
So if you think about it,
he's actually bought himself

354
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:26,245
a 40-minute window of opportunity.

355
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:29,085
Why can't they specify a time, huh?

356
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:34,685
“It's now 6:00. I expect I'll be
20 minutes, so I'll be back at 6:20.”

357
00:20:34,845 --> 00:20:37,565
How friggin' hard can it be?
You do the arithmetic.

358
00:20:37,725 --> 00:20:41,925
Oh. “Because I have
paying customers and I care.”

359
00:20:44,485 --> 00:20:46,725
I guess he left 19 minutes ago.

360
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:49,805
Yeah.

361
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,045
For Christ's sake, just don't
let him get under your skin.

362
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,565
Harry.

363
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,045
Harry.

364
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:01,925
David. Come on.

365
00:21:02,085 --> 00:21:05,845
How are ya, mate? Alright? Huh?

366
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:08,285
Alright, fuck the pleasantries.

367
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:11,485
Listen, come on, let's sort
this shit out here, OK?

368
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:15,085
It doesn't have to go to court.
Yes, it does. You defamed me.

369
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:18,125
Alright, I said some things,
you said some things,

370
00:21:18,285 --> 00:21:20,645
let's call the whole thing quits.

371
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:23,725
Come on, mate, I'll take you out
for a drink. What do you say?

372
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:25,925
Cleaver, I'm a public figure

373
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,725
and you deliberately set out
to damage my reputation.

374
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:30,445
Oh, you didn't set out
to damage mine?

375
00:21:30,605 --> 00:21:34,245
Damaging your reputation
is like trying to make shit stink.

376
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:36,645
If you're so upset about it,
why don't you make a counterclaim...

377
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:38,565
Fine. I'm trying to be reasonable.
I'll tell you why.

378
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:41,165
You know [I'll plead truth and win.
I'm happy to go in there.

379
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:43,405
You know I can prove you're...
We'll waste their fuckin' time.

380
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:45,805
..a disgrace of a human being.
More than happy to do it.

381
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:48,245
I'll see you inside.

382
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:56,525
Your Honour, in a former life,
the plaintiff, Mr Potter,

383
00:21:56,685 --> 00:22:01,005
was briefed by the Australian Tax Office
to act in a matter against me,

384
00:22:01,165 --> 00:22:05,005
a matter from which, I might add,
the ATO ultimately withdrew.

385
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:10,045
The plaintiff's defeat in this case

386
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:14,005
left him in what I would describe

387
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:17,765
as, um, a dangerous
state of mental health,

388
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:21,725
which was compounded
by the discovery

389
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:24,285
that prior to their engagement,

390
00:22:24,445 --> 00:22:29,485
I had been a longtime sexual partner
of his then fiancée.

391
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:34,325
Having already pursued me
like a serial killer in one life,

392
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:38,605
the plaintiff was then able
to use parliamentary privilege

393
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:41,245
to savage my reputation in the next.

394
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:43,005
So you see, Your Honour,

395
00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:48,165
it is the plaintiff himself
who is the root cause of this matter.

396
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:53,005
This man is after vengeance
and not justice,

397
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:56,405
and I would therefore
respectfully request

398
00:22:56,565 --> 00:22:58,405
that Your Honour dismiss it.

399
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:02,605
Yes, well, not in a month
of Sundays, Mr Greene.

400
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,885
What of mediation?

401
00:23:06,045 --> 00:23:10,525
Your Honour, we have twice written
to Mr Greene, requesting mediation,

402
00:23:10,685 --> 00:23:12,325
but he has not replied.

403
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:18,845
Your Honour, I would be more than
willing to attempt mediation.

404
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:22,885
I am completely persuaded
by Your Honour's argument.

405
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:25,125
Yes. Well, I made
no argument, Mr Greene.

406
00:23:25,285 --> 00:23:26,805
I merely asked a question.

407
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:30,885
But it was a question laced
with insight, Your Honour.

408
00:24:09,085 --> 00:24:11,285
I'm so sorry.
He should be here in a second.

409
00:24:11,445 --> 00:24:13,005
Would you like another coffee
or some water?

410
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:15,365
No, thank you. I'm fine.

411
00:24:35,085 --> 00:24:38,805
- Damien Chambers.
- Mitchell Browne.

412
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:41,765
My chapter's bigger than yours.

413
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:44,245
Hi.

414
00:24:44,405 --> 00:24:47,405
So how do you wanna handle this?
Maturely, of course.

415
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:49,045
Got a coin?

416
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:53,565
Heads?

417
00:25:00,285 --> 00:25:02,525
Hi, Mr McGregor. I'm Scarlet Engels.

418
00:25:02,685 --> 00:25:04,885
I'm sorry.

419
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,405
Have you read that book
by the hooker?

420
00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:09,205
I am aware of it, yes.

421
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:11,645
Well, a very reliable source
just told me

422
00:25:11,805 --> 00:25:14,565
that the bloke who's into nappies
is our transport minister.

423
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:18,805
Have a seat.
Thanks.

424
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:26,245
Would you like a drink?
Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

425
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:34,565
Engels?
So my parents tell me.

426
00:25:34,725 --> 00:25:36,965
You a leftie?
Pretty much.

427
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:39,885
Is that a problem?
Pretty much.

428
00:25:41,325 --> 00:25:43,285
But I'm told these days
it's fashionable

429
00:25:43,445 --> 00:25:45,925
to have opposition voices
inside the tent.

430
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:48,245
Helps to know what bullshit
they're gonna come up with.

431
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:49,885
Right.

432
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:53,925
So, you were at the bar?
Criminal prosecution mainly.

433
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:57,325
Mm-hm. And why the shift?
I have three kids.

434
00:25:57,485 --> 00:25:59,365
Three days a week here
will be easier

435
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,885
than running
a full-time private practice.

436
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:05,165
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to
try harder than that, Engels.

437
00:26:05,325 --> 00:26:07,525
You've got to want it.

438
00:26:09,965 --> 00:26:13,085
Oh, hold the friggin' phone.

439
00:26:14,325 --> 00:26:17,325
Says here you were suspended
from practice for a year.

440
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:19,085
That's right.

441
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,285
Well, what'd you do?
[, uh...

442
00:26:24,525 --> 00:26:27,405
I cross-examined a friend.
Rush of blood to the head.

443
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:30,245
Pretty bloody silly mistake,
if you ask me.

444
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:32,645
Mmm. Things were a little tough
at home at the time.

445
00:26:35,765 --> 00:26:39,605
Oh. OK, look, here's the deal.

446
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,845
I like you. Very impressed
by your experience.

447
00:26:44,005 --> 00:26:47,165
But this matter of suspension
calls into question

448
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:49,325
your judgement and/or ethics,

449
00:26:49,485 --> 00:26:52,245
and either way, that makes you
a little hot for me.

450
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,525
I'm sorry.
If you'd just give me a moment...

451
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:57,205
No, I've interviewed
four others for this job

452
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,085
and they've all got
less experience than you

453
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:00,765
and they're dull as fuckin' paint,

454
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:02,565
but they've got good
right wing credentials

455
00:27:02,725 --> 00:27:04,445
and they don't have
a rap sheet.

456
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:06,085
It's been nice chatting.

457
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:16,725
OK.

458
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,045
Just for the record,

459
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:24,285
this...so-called friend who
I shouldn't have cross-examined?

460
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:27,205
Yeah?
He's no friend.

461
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:32,165
In fact, he's brought nothing
but chaos and despair into my life.

462
00:27:32,325 --> 00:27:35,485
Yes, well, we all have people
like that in our lives.

463
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:37,685
And yours is Cleaver Greene, right?

464
00:27:41,565 --> 00:27:46,605
Well...so is mine, as it happens.

465
00:27:47,845 --> 00:27:50,165
Oh, the stories I could tell you.

466
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:55,725
Oh, well.

467
00:27:55,885 --> 00:27:58,285
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

468
00:28:01,485 --> 00:28:04,965
I had no idea there were
such mitigating factors.

469
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:14,925
This is very hard for me to say,
but when I finished reading your book,

470
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:18,485
I couldn't help but think
that for all his hideous flaws,

471
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:21,725
being Mitchell Browne sounded better
than being Damien Chambers.

472
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:24,805
There's no point of comparison.

473
00:28:24,965 --> 00:28:27,565
David, you two belong
in separate universes.

474
00:28:27,725 --> 00:28:30,045
Mine being the universe
of the school prefect.

475
00:28:30,205 --> 00:28:32,485
No.
You used those exact words.

476
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:34,325
Well, you're quoting me
out of context.

477
00:28:34,485 --> 00:28:36,165
I've toughened up
since you've been away.

478
00:28:36,325 --> 00:28:39,045
David...
Let's go get a drink or something.

479
00:28:40,925 --> 00:28:42,925
David, I'm engaged.

480
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:47,565
Oh.
Yeah.

481
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:50,045
Congratulations.

482
00:28:51,645 --> 00:28:54,525
Wow. Who is he?

483
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:56,645
Oh, you've heard of
good _plumbing.com?

484
00:28:56,805 --> 00:28:58,645
The leaks site?
Yeah.

485
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:02,565
What about it?
I'm engaged to Joshua Floyd.

486
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:29,445
- Hello?
- Got my email yet?

487
00:29:29,605 --> 00:29:31,245
Yes.

488
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:37,245
You have a webcam.
Don't need one.

489
00:29:37,405 --> 00:29:40,845
Lincoln's right. The lenses
on these new phones are amazing.

490
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:43,765
Everyone assumes you can't
capture images in low light,

491
00:29:43,925 --> 00:29:46,285
but...look at you.

492
00:29:46,445 --> 00:29:48,925
Yes, look at me.

493
00:29:49,085 --> 00:29:52,525
Mmm, I'm so pleased
you're my barrister, Cleaver,

494
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:55,605
because having had sex with you,

495
00:29:55,765 --> 00:29:58,005
I know you can get me off.

496
00:30:12,565 --> 00:30:15,085
Hmm. You've had a good day,
by the looks of things.

497
00:30:15,245 --> 00:30:16,925
Bloody internet.

498
00:30:17,085 --> 00:30:19,685
Is yours down?
I wish.

499
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:21,805
I wish it had never been invented.

500
00:30:21,965 --> 00:30:24,125
It's the end of civilisation
as we know it.

501
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:28,125
www.fuckme.com.

502
00:30:29,925 --> 00:30:34,005
Bring back paper, quills
and carrier pigeons.

503
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,205
What's happened?

504
00:30:36,365 --> 00:30:37,685
Nothing.

505
00:30:37,845 --> 00:30:40,085
Nothing.

506
00:30:40,245 --> 00:30:42,365
What's this stuff with Fuzz?

507
00:30:42,525 --> 00:30:45,605
Oh, he just said
he had something to tell us.

508
00:30:45,765 --> 00:30:48,325
Oh, yeah? What's it about?

509
00:30:48,485 --> 00:30:51,645
Well, whatever it is,
let's just be calm.

510
00:30:51,805 --> 00:30:54,485
If he has a problem,
then we need to be supportive

511
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,645
and work through it
with him rationally.

512
00:30:56,805 --> 00:30:59,205
OK?
Yes, Sister Wendy.

513
00:30:59,365 --> 00:31:01,805
Mum?
In here, darling.

514
00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:04,445
Hi, mate.

515
00:31:05,885 --> 00:31:08,325
What is it? What's up?

516
00:31:09,805 --> 00:31:11,885
There's something
I need to tell you guys.

517
00:31:13,325 --> 00:31:16,845
I've been seeing this girl
for the last year or so.

518
00:31:19,485 --> 00:31:22,405
It's been pretty full-on.
We're in love.

519
00:31:22,565 --> 00:31:25,405
Oh!
Good-o.

520
00:31:25,565 --> 00:31:27,885
Why the secrecy?

521
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:37,045
It's Sally. Sally?

522
00:31:37,205 --> 00:31:39,925
Sally who?
I don't know any Sally.

523
00:31:40,085 --> 00:31:42,085
Yeah, you do.

524
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:45,005
It's Sally from across the road.

525
00:31:47,965 --> 00:31:49,965
I'm really happy.

526
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:52,565
Right.

527
00:31:52,725 --> 00:31:57,645
Um, am I right in assuming that
there's no Sally Junior over there?

528
00:31:57,805 --> 00:31:59,165
All that exercise?

529
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:01,605
You haven't been jogging
in the afternoons.

530
00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:04,285
Not vertically, it would seem.

531
00:32:04,445 --> 00:32:07,325
The thing is, guys, we're pregnant.

532
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:15,285
Ah.

533
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:17,765
Mum?

534
00:32:20,165 --> 00:32:22,085
Mum, what are you doing?
Hey! Wendy!

535
00:32:22,245 --> 00:32:23,565
Mum!
No, no!

536
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:25,645
Sally!
Wendy. Wendy, I wouldn't.

537
00:32:25,805 --> 00:32:27,485
Mum, stop! sally

538
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:30,765
Mum, she's not home!
Sally, you get out here now!

539
00:32:30,925 --> 00:32:32,365
Wendy, she's not...
Treacherous bitch.

540
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:35,285
Wendy, she's not home.
What is wrong with you?!

541
00:32:35,445 --> 00:32:37,045
She's got a boy your age!

542
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,325
Look, let's just go back inside
and talk about this rationally.

543
00:32:39,485 --> 00:32:42,645
There is nothing rational about this
situation. This is totally insane.

544
00:32:42,805 --> 00:32:44,365
What, because of the age difference?

545
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:46,205
Well, just for starters, mate, yeah.

546
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,325
You are such a hypocrite!
I beg your pardon.

547
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:49,885
It's alright for
middle-aged men like you

548
00:32:50,045 --> 00:32:51,365
to go around having
young girlfriends...

549
00:32:51,525 --> 00:32:52,965
Isn't it? No, that is not the point.

550
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:54,245
It's not as if your father

551
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:55,725
is gallivanting round town
rooting 17-year-olds,

552
00:32:55,885 --> 00:32:57,245
so don't you make this about him.

553
00:32:57,405 --> 00:32:59,005
Yes. Don't make it about me.

554
00:32:59,165 --> 00:33:00,485
I knew you wouldn't understand.

555
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,845
Look, mate, you can't
go around dropping bombs

556
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:05,525
and then whinge
when everybody screams.

557
00:33:05,685 --> 00:33:08,245
Says the man who's made
dropping bombs into an art form.

558
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:10,805
Maybe I have, but when I fuck up,
I take the heat.

559
00:33:10,965 --> 00:33:14,125
You think this is a fuck-up?
Isn't it?

560
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:17,165
Are you telling us
you planned this?

561
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:22,165
It's my child we're talking about.
It's not a fuck-up!

562
00:33:28,285 --> 00:33:30,805
First his English teacher,
now Sally.

563
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:33,525
You know he's never brought home
a girl his own age.

564
00:33:33,685 --> 00:33:36,325
This is officially a pattern.
Hmm.

565
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:38,365
What have we done to him?

566
00:33:38,525 --> 00:33:43,045
Oh, bit early to start
blaming ourselves, isn't it?

567
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:44,765
We should be doing

568
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:47,965
what other 21st-century parents do
at times like this —

569
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,605
blame someone else.

570
00:33:49,765 --> 00:33:51,565
You know, there's the school,

571
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:54,445
there's...there's
general societal malaise,

572
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:57,325
there's your mother, GFC,

573
00:33:57,485 --> 00:33:59,485
tensions in the Middle East.

574
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:01,085
We can blame any number
of phenomenon

575
00:34:01,245 --> 00:34:05,925
before we have to shine the old
searchlight of truth on ourselves.

576
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,485
And when we do, my darling,
I think you'll discover

577
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:10,525
that it's pretty much your fault.

578
00:34:11,605 --> 00:34:12,925
Excuse me?

579
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:15,845
You know, it's Oedipus.
It's all that shit. You're the shrink.

580
00:34:16,005 --> 00:34:17,485
I'm not amused.

581
00:34:17,645 --> 00:34:19,365
I'm not saying it was deliberate.

582
00:34:19,525 --> 00:34:23,525
You know, you obviously just
brushed your hand up against it

583
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:26,165
when you were giving him a bath
when he was four, or something,

584
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:27,805
and that was it.

585
00:34:36,045 --> 00:34:37,525
I don't know who I can trust.

586
00:34:37,685 --> 00:34:39,885
You know, any one of my friends
could be targets.

587
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,285
I mean, it was bad enough
when you were cracking onto them,

588
00:34:42,445 --> 00:34:43,765
but both of you...

589
00:34:43,925 --> 00:34:46,045
We'll have to work out
a roster or something.

590
00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:06,165
Oh, no.
Here we go.

591
00:35:06,325 --> 00:35:09,085
Charlotte. Charlotte.

592
00:35:12,245 --> 00:35:14,405
Please, leave her.
Charlotte.

593
00:35:14,565 --> 00:35:16,725
Charlotte, have you
released a statement?

594
00:35:16,885 --> 00:35:22,005
My client, Emily Carlton,
is a 16-year-old.

595
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:25,885
She attends the prestigious
girls' school Kelly House

596
00:35:26,045 --> 00:35:27,405
on a half scholarship.

597
00:35:27,565 --> 00:35:30,725
She's a straight A student,
second in her year.

598
00:35:30,885 --> 00:35:34,405
She's a member of the debating,
swimming, hockey and tennis teams,

599
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,365
and an accomplished equestrian
in her own right.

600
00:35:37,525 --> 00:35:41,325
She's a member of
Amnesty International, Greenpeace

601
00:35:41,485 --> 00:35:44,805
and was voted Young Lion
in her district last year.

602
00:35:45,805 --> 00:35:47,165
Needless to say, she doesn't have

603
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:49,365
the slightest whiff
of a criminal record.

604
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:54,685
Yet this fine young girl
you see standing before you

605
00:35:54,845 --> 00:35:59,045
is accused of
the most terrible thing —

606
00:35:59,205 --> 00:36:02,765
causing the death
of another human being.

607
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:06,125
Ladies and gentlemen,

608
00:36:06,285 --> 00:36:10,245
everything my learned friend
has said in his opening address

609
00:36:10,405 --> 00:36:12,165
can also be applied to my client,

610
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:14,885
except that my client
was first in her year,

611
00:36:15,045 --> 00:36:17,725
captain of the debating team

612
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:21,965
and attends Kelly House
on a full scholarship.

613
00:36:41,485 --> 00:36:43,725
Isn't this a school night?

614
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:49,405
And by school night, I mean
aren't you both out on bail?

615
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:52,405
Your parents have any understanding
of the word ‘curfew'?

616
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:55,805
Oh, come on, Cleave,
we're dying to see your place.

617
00:37:05,565 --> 00:37:07,085
Oh, my God.

618
00:37:07,245 --> 00:37:09,165
You're a barrister
and you live like this?

619
00:37:09,325 --> 00:37:10,645
No. He's only criminal.

620
00:37:10,805 --> 00:37:12,845
I'm definitely going corporate then.

621
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:15,725
You do make more money
in corporate, right?

622
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:17,325
Listen, you two...

623
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,085
We're not very happy
with you, Cleaver.

624
00:37:19,245 --> 00:37:20,285
Really?

625
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:22,325
Really.

626
00:37:22,485 --> 00:37:25,445
Oh, well, am I gonna
get some notes now?

627
00:37:25,605 --> 00:37:28,405
Well, you know, your heart just
didn't seem to be in it today.

628
00:37:28,565 --> 00:37:29,885
Are you OK?

629
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:32,525
We wanted to let you know
if there's anything that we can do

630
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:35,605
to help you.. lift your game.

631
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:46,365
So, what is this, blackmail?

632
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:47,845
Yeah?

633
00:37:48,005 --> 00:37:51,325
If I don't get you off,
your iPhone footage goes viral

634
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:52,805
and you cry rape

635
00:37:52,965 --> 00:37:56,285
and the judge declares a mistrial
and the whole thing disappears.

636
00:37:56,445 --> 00:38:01,165
Is that...is that the plan, Michelle,
the master plan,

637
00:38:01,325 --> 00:38:03,245
along with bumping into me
at the theatre?

638
00:38:03,405 --> 00:38:08,485
You're right. He is
a little jaded and cynical, isn't he?

639
00:38:08,645 --> 00:38:13,365
Mmm. Yeah, but still...very cute.

640
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:15,605
I guess. We'd better go.

641
00:38:15,765 --> 00:38:17,885
Yes, we better.

642
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,725
See ya, Cleave.

643
00:38:37,925 --> 00:38:39,405
Fuck.

644
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:45,525
- Hello?
- Who are they, Cleave?

645
00:38:45,685 --> 00:38:48,965
Who are who?
Don't you fuck me around!

646
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,845
The girls in your flat.

647
00:38:52,885 --> 00:38:54,725
Kirsty, where are you?

648
00:38:54,885 --> 00:38:57,485
Are you...are you having me followed?

649
00:38:57,645 --> 00:39:00,725
You have two girls,
and they're hookers, aren't they?!

650
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:03,725
They're hookers dressed up
like schoolgirls.

651
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:06,925
No, no, they're not. They're not.
They're not hookers.

652
00:39:07,085 --> 00:39:09,005
They're not hookers
dressed up as schoolgirls.

653
00:39:09,165 --> 00:39:11,085
They're actual schoolgirls.

654
00:39:11,245 --> 00:39:12,725
I mean, they're...they're...

655
00:39:12,885 --> 00:39:17,565
They're the...the schoolgirls who are
on trial for murdering the actor.

656
00:39:21,565 --> 00:39:22,885
What?

657
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:24,805
Yeah, do you remember?
I told you about it.

658
00:39:24,965 --> 00:39:26,365
I'm defending one of them.

659
00:39:26,525 --> 00:39:27,965
Oh.

660
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:30,565
Oh, darling, I'm so sorry.

661
00:39:30,725 --> 00:39:33,285
Yeah, oh, that's alright.

662
00:39:33,445 --> 00:39:36,165
You know, I...it's, uh...

663
00:39:36,325 --> 00:39:39,365
It's understandable enough
with me, I guess.

664
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:44,485
Oh, how can I make it up to you?

665
00:39:44,509 --> 00:39:52,509
http://hiqve.com/

666
00:41:15,685 --> 00:41:17,485
Oh, hello.

667
00:41:35,085 --> 00:41:36,925
Hey.
Hey.

668
00:41:39,485 --> 00:41:40,725
Dry-cleaning?
Yeah.

669
00:41:40,885 --> 00:41:43,725
I can drop it off in the morning
on my way to the office.

670
00:41:43,885 --> 00:41:45,565
I found 50 bucks
in your blue pinstripe.

671
00:41:45,725 --> 00:41:47,245
Ker-ching.
Mmm.

672
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:51,125
And this in your grey serge.
Mmm, thanks.

673
00:41:52,405 --> 00:41:56,005
That's Cleaver's handwriting.
Yeah, must be from ages ago.

674
00:41:56,165 --> 00:41:58,445
Leonard Fenton, wasn't it?

675
00:41:58,605 --> 00:42:04,485
No, no, Lawrence.
Lawrence Fenton, I seem to recall.

676
00:42:04,645 --> 00:42:06,045
We'd represented Lawrence before,

677
00:42:06,205 --> 00:42:07,965
so can we just keep this
in perspective?

678
00:42:09,165 --> 00:42:12,445
I didn't wanna upset you.
It wasn't that big a deal.

679
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:15,605
It was big enough for you
to lie to me about it.

680
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:18,165
Don't make this a thing.
It was just a case.

681
00:42:18,325 --> 00:42:19,805
It's not like I...

682
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,085
Well, go on.

683
00:42:24,165 --> 00:42:25,805
Finish your sentence.

684
00:42:45,085 --> 00:42:48,245
Coming up next
in our Festival of Classic Thrillers,

685
00:42:48,405 --> 00:42:51,525
two cold-blooded Killers,
one hapless victim —

686
00:42:51,685 --> 00:42:54,685
Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece ‘Rope'.

687
00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:11,045
Have you seen ‘Rope'?

688
00:43:12,285 --> 00:43:13,125
What?

689
00:43:13,285 --> 00:43:15,605
They're sociopaths, right,
or psychopaths?

690
00:43:15,765 --> 00:43:17,285
A bit of both, really.

691
00:43:17,445 --> 00:43:19,845
I think...I think they're my clients.

692
00:43:20,005 --> 00:43:21,925
Or one of them is my client.

693
00:43:22,085 --> 00:43:23,765
What, that little girl?

694
00:43:23,925 --> 00:43:27,365
She can easily pass
for 24, that girl.

695
00:43:28,725 --> 00:43:33,765
Anyway, she and her friend
are both Hitchcock fans.

696
00:43:33,925 --> 00:43:36,205
You know ‘Rope's based on
a true story?

697
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:39,245
Leopold and Loeb.
Chicago in the "20s.

698
00:43:39,405 --> 00:43:40,725
Yeah.

699
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:42,205
Describe them.

700
00:43:42,365 --> 00:43:45,605
Highly intelligent
but emotionally infantile.

701
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:50,365
Go on.

702
00:43:50,525 --> 00:43:53,925
Well, an IQ of 170 and the
emotional maturity of a 5-year-old

703
00:43:54,085 --> 00:43:57,885
is a pretty hairy combination,
psychologically.

704
00:43:58,045 --> 00:44:00,645
From what I remember, these guys
believed they were supermen.

705
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,365
Supermen, as in...?

706
00:44:02,525 --> 00:44:04,165
As in the Nietzschean view that

707
00:44:04,325 --> 00:44:06,565
society was moving towards
the evolution of a superman

708
00:44:06,725 --> 00:44:09,925
who would be beyond
the laws of good and evil.

709
00:44:10,085 --> 00:44:11,565
Nietzsche.

710
00:44:13,005 --> 00:44:16,565
I've always thought,
never trust men who wear capes.

711
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:20,765
Now, you're sure
you're on top of this?

712
00:44:20,925 --> 00:44:22,885
Yes, I'm sure.
Now, you cannot cock this up.

713
00:44:23,045 --> 00:44:24,565
Trust me, Cleave, OK?

714
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:26,565
I played Caiaphas in
the school production of ‘Superstar'.

715
00:44:26,725 --> 00:44:28,605
I know what I'm doing.
Jesus Christ.

716
00:44:28,765 --> 00:44:30,165
- Morning, Lou.
- Morning, Cleaver.

717
00:44:30,325 --> 00:44:32,085
- Lincoln.
- How was your evening?

718
00:44:32,245 --> 00:44:34,205
Fine. How was yours?

719
00:44:34,365 --> 00:44:36,565
Oh, you know, pretty relaxing.
A little bit of homework.

720
00:44:36,725 --> 00:44:38,525
Watched a DVD.
Have you seen Hitchcock's 'Rope'?

721
00:44:38,685 --> 00:44:40,645
Oh, years ago, I think.
No, it's OK, Cleave.

722
00:44:40,805 --> 00:44:42,925
It's a really interesting movie,
It's about these two young guys...

723
00:44:43,085 --> 00:44:44,485
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure Lou

724
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:46,845
doesn't need to hear about
your evening highlights, mate.

725
00:44:47,005 --> 00:44:48,365
Sorry, Cleave.
‘Rope'. ‘Rope'.

726
00:44:48,525 --> 00:44:51,885
Yeah, I've seen that. That's the one
about the two young thrill-killers.

727
00:44:52,045 --> 00:44:54,965
Sorry, Cleave.

728
00:44:57,685 --> 00:44:59,165
Oh, fuck.

729
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:02,925
And it transpires, Your Honour,
that this film, ‘Rope',

730
00:45:03,085 --> 00:45:05,885
which depicts a premeditated murder

731
00:45:06,045 --> 00:45:08,405
committed purely
for the thrill of it,

732
00:45:08,565 --> 00:45:10,845
was on the Kelly House
Year 10 visual arts curriculum.

733
00:45:11,005 --> 00:45:14,365
Your Honour, I object. I object
in the strongest possible terms.

734
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:19,805
Does my friend here really think
that he can bolster his paper-thin case

735
00:45:19,965 --> 00:45:22,885
by tendering as evidence
a motion picture

736
00:45:23,045 --> 00:45:26,885
made almost 50 years
before my client was born?

737
00:45:27,045 --> 00:45:29,845
Your Honour, when the film
was made is entirely irrelevant.

738
00:45:33,485 --> 00:45:35,965
For fuck's sake, guys,
what are we doing?

739
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:37,565
Are you just being silly?

740
00:45:37,725 --> 00:45:39,165
Bloody movies?

741
00:45:39,325 --> 00:45:41,205
Have you seen
this bloody movie, Robbo?

742
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:43,245
These girls are carbon copies.

743
00:45:43,405 --> 00:45:45,765
It's a joke, Robbo.
Cleaver's right, Lou.

744
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:47,925
It's also circumstantial.

745
00:45:48,085 --> 00:45:49,805
I reckon they did it.

746
00:45:49,965 --> 00:45:51,765
They set out to copy the movie,

747
00:45:51,925 --> 00:45:53,845
only this time, of course,
they get away with it.

748
00:45:54,005 --> 00:45:56,965
Then you should withdraw manslaughter
and hit 'em with murder.

749
00:45:57,125 --> 00:46:00,245
Is that something
you're contemplating, Lou?

750
00:46:00,405 --> 00:46:03,405
Because it would be a brave move
if all you've got's coincidence.

751
00:46:05,605 --> 00:46:08,805
Nup.
Alright, then.

752
00:46:08,965 --> 00:46:10,725
The charge remains manslaughter.

753
00:46:10,885 --> 00:46:12,565
Now, we all know
where this thing is going.

754
00:46:12,725 --> 00:46:14,445
I'm not about to ruin
these girls' lives

755
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,325
by sending them off to jail
for an accident.

756
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:19,765
So please,
can we wrap this thing up?

757
00:46:21,045 --> 00:46:23,365
It's not good news, I'm afraid.

758
00:46:23,525 --> 00:46:26,765
The judge has suggested
to the prosecution...

759
00:46:26,925 --> 00:46:28,845
...that he withdraw...

760
00:46:29,005 --> 00:46:33,485
..the manslaughter charge
and replace it with murder.

761
00:46:35,165 --> 00:46:38,645
Now, I said if they did that
that we'd immediately appeal

762
00:46:38,805 --> 00:46:41,845
and take it all the way
to the High Court if need be.

763
00:46:43,325 --> 00:46:45,005
The judge has backed down,

764
00:46:45,165 --> 00:46:48,325
but God knows what instructions
he's gonna give to the jury.

765
00:46:48,485 --> 00:46:50,725
Now, if the jury comes back
with a guilty verdict,

766
00:46:50,885 --> 00:46:53,005
His Honour has indicated

767
00:46:53,165 --> 00:46:56,165
that the girls will be doing
some serious time.

768
00:47:02,645 --> 00:47:06,045
So what options do we have?

769
00:47:07,885 --> 00:47:11,405
Well, look, Emily was the director.

770
00:47:11,565 --> 00:47:14,685
Emily bought the knife.
It was her house.

771
00:47:14,845 --> 00:47:17,525
Emily was the one
who downloaded ‘Rope'.

772
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:21,645
You were just an actor in this thing,
weren't you, Michelle?

773
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:25,525
So you had no influence over it
whatsoever, isn't that the case?

774
00:47:27,565 --> 00:47:29,125
Darling?

775
00:47:31,925 --> 00:47:33,405
OK.

776
00:47:34,405 --> 00:47:37,605
Now, I need to have a quiet word
with Michelle, please.

777
00:47:42,325 --> 00:47:44,445
Lincoln, my phone's died.

778
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:47,085
Could I possibly
borrow yours, please?

779
00:47:47,245 --> 00:47:48,645
Well, don't you have a landline?

780
00:47:48,805 --> 00:47:52,805
I do, but I've been told
that my contract has expired.

781
00:47:52,965 --> 00:47:54,285
It's gonna be OK.

782
00:47:54,445 --> 00:47:56,245
OK, well, just be careful,
it's got...

783
00:48:04,045 --> 00:48:06,245
Mmm.

784
00:48:06,405 --> 00:48:11,565
I'm the only thing standing between you
and a lengthy jail term,

785
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:13,965
followed by a life
of complete misery.

786
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,805
Do you realise that?

787
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:20,285
I've been watching the judge.
Bet he's got daughters himself.

788
00:48:20,445 --> 00:48:22,525
He's not about to give us
serious time.

789
00:48:22,685 --> 00:48:24,005
Really?

790
00:48:24,165 --> 00:48:27,485
Why would I lie to you?
To rattle me.

791
00:48:27,645 --> 00:48:31,725
Maybe get me to strike
some sort of bargain with you.

792
00:48:31,885 --> 00:48:34,485
Well, what sort of bargain
could I possibly strike?

793
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,605
You could have your little video
of us on 100 drives by now.

794
00:48:37,765 --> 00:48:39,845
Exactly.

795
00:48:40,005 --> 00:48:43,285
So you know
what the consequences will be

796
00:48:43,445 --> 00:48:47,365
if you don't get out there now
and do your fucking job.

797
00:48:51,245 --> 00:48:56,765
I'd think very seriously about
my next step, if I were you, Michelle.

798
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:14,605
I swear by almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

799
00:49:14,765 --> 00:49:17,645
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

800
00:49:17,805 --> 00:49:19,285
Please take a seat.

801
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,805
You and Emily have been best friends
for many years now?

802
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:31,205
We have. Yeah, since we were five.

803
00:49:31,365 --> 00:49:33,765
And you've studied
and played together.

804
00:49:33,925 --> 00:49:37,405
You've lived in and out
of each other's houses?

805
00:49:37,565 --> 00:49:39,165
That's correct.

806
00:49:39,325 --> 00:49:42,125
As close as friends can be?

807
00:49:44,605 --> 00:49:47,845
You're also the smartest girls
in your class.

808
00:49:48,005 --> 00:49:52,165
You're both exceptionally well-read,
both highly creative.

809
00:49:52,325 --> 00:49:54,645
And through
your cinema studies class,

810
00:49:54,805 --> 00:49:56,845
you became devotees
of Alfred Hitchcock.

811
00:49:57,005 --> 00:50:01,245
You decided to emulate him,
to make a film of your own.

812
00:50:02,645 --> 00:50:07,045
I'm sorry, but when you say,
“You decided to emulate,”

813
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:09,645
it wasn't me, or even us.

814
00:50:09,805 --> 00:50:12,525
It was Em who decided
she wanted to make the movie.

815
00:50:12,685 --> 00:50:14,165
She wrote and directed it.

816
00:50:14,325 --> 00:50:18,405
I was just an actress
without any influence, really.

817
00:50:18,565 --> 00:50:20,965
She told me what to do.

818
00:50:22,405 --> 00:50:24,485
She told you what to do?

819
00:50:24,645 --> 00:50:28,365
Emily'd like that, wouldn't she —
the girl who always came second?

820
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,405
Emily felt inferior to you,
didn't she?

821
00:50:31,565 --> 00:50:33,805
Objection.
I'll allow it.

822
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:35,765
I don't know about that.

823
00:50:35,925 --> 00:50:41,205
She was desperate to assert
some kind of superiority, wasn't she?

824
00:50:41,365 --> 00:50:43,445
And this was the way
that she was gonna do it.

825
00:50:43,605 --> 00:50:46,325
She was going to seduce you
into a situation

826
00:50:46,485 --> 00:50:50,765
where she could direct you
to fulfil her own sick fantasies.

827
00:50:50,925 --> 00:50:52,845
Is that not the case?
Objection!

828
00:50:53,005 --> 00:50:55,125
Mr Greene, get to the point.

829
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,245
That is what happened,
isn't it, Michelle?

830
00:50:57,405 --> 00:51:01,005
Emily was the one
who turned the knife into a weapon.

831
00:51:01,165 --> 00:51:06,245
It was her plan. This was her idea.
You have to stop protecting her.

832
00:51:06,405 --> 00:51:07,765
You lying bitch.
Emily!

833
00:51:07,925 --> 00:51:09,965
It was you, you're the one
that told me to download ‘Rope'...

834
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:11,485
- Shut up, Em!
- Miss Carlton!

835
00:51:11,645 --> 00:51:13,125
You picked up the guy at the party

836
00:51:13,285 --> 00:51:15,405
and you told me that
after you stabbed him, you came!

837
00:51:15,565 --> 00:51:17,605
This is completely outrageous!

838
00:51:17,765 --> 00:51:20,245
Your Honour, I'd appreciate
an adjournment.

839
00:51:20,405 --> 00:51:22,125
The Crown may wish
to amend the indictment

840
00:51:22,285 --> 00:51:24,685
and replace the current charges
with charges of murder.

841
00:51:38,045 --> 00:51:39,965
Why would I lie to you?

842
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:41,685
To rattle me.

843
00:51:41,845 --> 00:51:45,525
Maybe get me to strike
some sort of bargain.

844
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,125
Well, what sort of bargain
could I possibly strike?

845
00:51:48,285 --> 00:51:51,285
You could have your little video
of us on 100 drives by now.

846
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:52,765
Exactly.

847
00:51:52,925 --> 00:51:55,725
So you know what
the consequences will be

848
00:51:55,885 --> 00:52:00,085
if you don't get out there now
and do your fucking job.

849
00:52:01,365 --> 00:52:04,125
I apologise for the shitty framing.

850
00:52:05,245 --> 00:52:07,845
She's a very ill girl, Charles.

851
00:52:08,005 --> 00:52:10,965
You took advantage of her.
No.

852
00:52:16,645 --> 00:52:20,405
Alright, I'll have anything
that incriminates you dealt with.

853
00:52:20,565 --> 00:52:22,525
She still trusts me.

854
00:52:22,685 --> 00:52:24,885
She idolises you.

855
00:52:26,525 --> 00:52:28,645
She's barely 16.

856
00:52:28,805 --> 00:52:31,165
She should have
her whole life ahead of her.

857
00:52:31,325 --> 00:52:34,245
16 is the new 35.

858
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,605
I never want to see you again.

859
00:52:44,765 --> 00:52:47,885
I figured that.

860
00:52:53,445 --> 00:52:54,925
Ms Gardyne?

861
00:52:55,925 --> 00:52:57,245
Ms Gardyne?

862
00:52:57,405 --> 00:52:58,885
Charlie?

863
00:53:00,085 --> 00:53:01,405
Did you ever suspect

864
00:53:01,565 --> 00:53:03,005
she had any responsibility
for what happened?

865
00:53:03,165 --> 00:53:06,045
This has come as a great
shock to all of us in her family.

866
00:53:06,205 --> 00:53:07,685
Our hearts go out
to the victim's family.

867
00:53:07,845 --> 00:53:10,845
Obviously it's a tragic event.

868
00:53:11,005 --> 00:53:14,525
And I'm still processing information.
It's very shocking.

869
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:21,645
Nothing really changes, does it?
Tragically, no.

870
00:53:21,805 --> 00:53:24,245
There's always one place
I know I can find you.

871
00:53:24,405 --> 00:53:28,925
Yeah, well, there used to be two, but
that was when I was a petulant child.

872
00:53:29,085 --> 00:53:32,645
‘Lost' child.
I think you'll find it's ‘petulant'.

873
00:53:32,805 --> 00:53:36,125
Well, I wrote the fucking book, Cleaver.
It's ‘lost'.

874
00:53:38,085 --> 00:53:41,605
We should talk.
Indeed we should.

875
00:53:41,765 --> 00:53:46,925
I understand things are getting right
out of hand in the Gaza Strip again.

876
00:53:47,085 --> 00:53:49,405
I'm getting married, Cleave.

877
00:53:52,285 --> 00:53:55,325
One engagement
may look like a misfortune.

878
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:57,365
Two look like a habit.

879
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:01,525
Why are you here?
I just wanna talk to you.

880
00:54:01,685 --> 00:54:03,645
OK. Why?

881
00:54:03,805 --> 00:54:06,365
Because you have
an inquisitive mind.

882
00:54:06,525 --> 00:54:08,325
Is that what you call it?

883
00:54:09,485 --> 00:54:12,365
What would you say of my mind
if I told you

884
00:54:12,525 --> 00:54:16,205
that it had been seduced
by a 15-year-old sociopath?

885
00:54:16,365 --> 00:54:20,165
Middle-aged men
do not get seduced by youth.

886
00:54:20,325 --> 00:54:21,925
Oh, really?
No.

887
00:54:22,085 --> 00:54:24,565
You can't be seduced by something
you're already craving.

888
00:54:24,725 --> 00:54:27,685
Saying that you've been seduced
is just a bid for victim status.

889
00:54:34,165 --> 00:54:37,245
Are you free for dinner tonight?
He gets in tomorrow.

890
00:54:39,005 --> 00:54:43,965
Oh, brave new world
that hath such people in it.
