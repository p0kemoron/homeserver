1
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,044
Three of a kind, let's do this.
That's it? Three guys?

2
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:51,543
Two guys on the roof. Every
guy gets a share. Five shares is plenty.

3
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:54,169
Six shares. Don't
forget the guy who planned the job.

4
00:01:54,342 --> 00:01:56,629
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice.

5
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:59,921
I know why they call him the Joker.
Why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:02:00,098 --> 00:02:01,923
I heard he wears makeup.
Makeup?

7
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,056
Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.

8
00:02:16,614 --> 00:02:19,816
All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:22,987
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:26,114
Let's go, pal,
I'm making a withdrawal here.

11
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:27,831
-I said, hands up!
-No!

12
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:30,449
Here comes the silent alarm.

13
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:31,955
And there it goes.

14
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,327
Heads down!

15
00:02:33,506 --> 00:02:35,830
All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:36,008 --> 00:02:38,676
-Down! I said, stay down there!
Don't hurt me!

17
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:41,927
Funny, it didn't dial 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:44,006
Is it a problem?
No, I'm done here.

19
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:55,772
Sit down! Down!

20
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:58,435
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:05,535
Obviously we don't want you
doing anything with your hands...

22
00:03:05,704 --> 00:03:08,620
...other than holding on for dear life.

23
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:18,373
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

24
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,214
Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!

25
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:39,683
Yeah!

26
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:44,606
You have any idea
who you're stealing from?

27
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:48,484
-You and your friends are dead.
He's out, right?

28
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,826
What...?

29
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:02,417
Where did you learn to count?

30
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:07,259
They wired this thing up
with like 5000 volts.

31
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:08,675
What kind of bank does that?

32
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,885
A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

33
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:13,091
Where's the alarm guy?

34
00:04:13,271 --> 00:04:15,760
Boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

35
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,267
One less share, right?

36
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,432
Funny, he told me something similar.

37
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:22,068
He what? No! No!

38
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,165
That's a lot of money.

39
00:04:35,334 --> 00:04:39,033
If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

40
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:44,377
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me
soon as we loaded the cash.

41
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:49,084
No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

42
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:50,920
Bus driver?

43
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:54,637
What bus driver?

44
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,640
School's out. Time to go.

45
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:03,058
That guy's not getting up, is he?

46
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:05,479
That's a lot of money.

47
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:11,316
What happened to the rest of the guys?

48
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,456
You think you're smart, huh?

49
00:05:21,171 --> 00:05:22,794
The guy that hired youse...

50
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,912
...he'll just do the same to you.

51
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:29,170
Oh, criminals in this town
used to believe in things.

52
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:30,625
Honor...

53
00:05:30,806 --> 00:05:32,512
...respect.

54
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:35,006
Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?

55
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:36,464
What do you believe in?!

56
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:41,722
I believe whatever doesn't kill you
simply makes you...

57
00:05:43,318 --> 00:05:44,859
...stranger.

58
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,735
Mr. Mayor, you were elected
in a campaign to clean up the city.

59
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:32,062
-When are you gonna start?
I already have.

60
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,319
Like this Batman.

61
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:36,064
We're hearing he's doing good,
criminals are running scared.

62
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:39,944
-No, man. I don't like it tonight.
-What are you, superstitious?

63
00:06:40,124 --> 00:06:43,207
You got more chance of winning
the Powerball than running into him.

64
00:06:43,377 --> 00:06:46,744
That's not true. Our men in the
Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.

65
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:49,874
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says
you're closing in on the Batman.

66
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,171
The investigation is ongoing.

67
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:54,750
The process of cleaning up
the streets is a long one.

68
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,921
I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...

69
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,557
Ever intending to see your wife again,
lieutenant?

70
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,398
I thought you had to
go look after your mother, detective.

71
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,523
Checked her back into the hospital.

72
00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:10,609
I'm sorry.

73
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:14,397
-So he hasn't shown up?
-He often doesn't.

74
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:16,489
I like reminding everybody
he's out there.

75
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,939
Why wouldn't he come?

76
00:07:18,286 --> 00:07:20,111
Hopefully...

77
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:22,163
...because he's busy.

78
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,806
That's why we bring dogs.

79
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:44,300
-My little princes.
Please.

80
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,060
Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.

81
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:50,983
Look what your drugs
do to my customers.

82
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:52,775
Buyer beware.

83
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:56,148
I told you my compound
would take you places.

84
00:07:56,324 --> 00:07:59,074
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

85
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:01,779
My business, repeat customers.

86
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:03,660
You don't like
what I have to offer...

87
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:05,573
...you can buy from someone else.

88
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,500
Assuming Batman left anyone
to buy from.

89
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,835
My dogs are hungry.

90
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:21,843
Pity there's only one of you.

91
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:31,473
What...?
That's not him.

92
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:37,605
Loose the dogs!

93
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:51,876
That's more like it.

94
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:21,707
Don't let me find you out here again.

95
00:10:21,884 --> 00:10:24,718
-We're trying to help you.
I don't need help.

96
00:10:24,887 --> 00:10:26,214
Not my diagnosis.

97
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:29,969
What gives you the right? What's
the difference between you and me?

98
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:33,011
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

99
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:38,479
Everybody back now!

100
00:10:40,652 --> 00:10:43,817
He can't resist showing us his face.

101
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:50,233
What's he hiding under that makeup?

102
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:00,629
Uh, can we get a minute,
people, please?

103
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:05,415
Him again. Who are the others?

104
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:07,170
Another bunch of smalltimers.

105
00:11:08,555 --> 00:11:10,261
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

106
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:12,719
My detectives have been
making drug buys with them.

107
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:15,464
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.

108
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:18,216
-We found the bulk of their dirty cash.
-Time to move in.

109
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:22,179
We'd have to hit all banks
simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.

110
00:11:22,526 --> 00:11:24,184
What about this Joker guy?

111
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:27,313
One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.

112
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:29,813
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

113
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:32,528
-Do you trust him?
-Be hard to keep him out.

114
00:11:32,703 --> 00:11:36,153
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

115
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:22,659
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.

116
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:25,538
You can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse...

117
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:27,254
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

118
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:31,170
Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.

119
00:12:31,344 --> 00:12:34,343
Yeah. It makes me learn
from my mistakes.

120
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:37,927
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.

121
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:40,673
My armor.

122
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:44,434
I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be... I need to be faster.

123
00:12:44,607 --> 00:12:47,275
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.

124
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:49,932
-Did you get mauled by a tiger?
-It was a dog.

125
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:52,648
-Huh?
-It was a big dog.

126
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:56,689
There were more copycats last night,
Alfred, with guns.

127
00:12:56,869 --> 00:12:58,777
Why not hire them,
take the weekend off?

128
00:12:58,954 --> 00:13:01,788
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind...

129
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:03,699
...when I said I wanted
to inspire people.

130
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:05,784
I know.

131
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:07,454
But things have improved.

132
00:13:07,671 --> 00:13:10,125
Look at the new district attorney.

133
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:12,790
I am, closely.

134
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:14,876
Need to know if he can be trusted.

135
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:19,096
Are you interested in his character
or his social circle?

136
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:25,307
Who Rachel spends her time with
is her business.

137
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,347
I trust you don't have me followed
on my day off.

138
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:31,600
If you ever took one, I might.

139
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,318
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

140
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,608
Batman has no limits.

141
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,820
-Well, you do, sir.
-Well, can't afford to know them.

142
00:13:41,997 --> 00:13:44,486
And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

143
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,369
We all know how much you like to say
"I told you so."

144
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:50,876
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

145
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:52,504
Probably.

146
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:01,005
Sorry I'm late, folks.

147
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:07,141
-Where were you?
-Worried you'd have to step up?

148
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,312
-Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
-Well, then...

149
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,474
...fair's fair.

150
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,690
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

151
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:16,936
Yeah? You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads?

152
00:14:17,114 --> 00:14:20,528
My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

153
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:23,866
I wouldn't leave something like that
up to chance.

154
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:27,288
I don't. I make my own luck.

155
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:32,836
All rise.
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.

156
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,673
I thought the DA just
played golf with the mayor.

157
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:39,540
Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.

158
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,261
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...

159
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,429
...someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called family.

160
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:47,549
Is that man in this courtroom today?

161
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:52,721
-Could you identify him for us, please?
-You win, counselor.

162
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:56,561
It was me.

163
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,062
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...

164
00:15:02,242 --> 00:15:05,941
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.

165
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:10,247
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

166
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:13,167
Order.
-Permission to treat...

167
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:14,579
...the witness as hostile?
-Granted.

168
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:15,785
-Hostile? I'll show you hostile!

169
00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:24,762
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber,
made in China.

170
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:26,472
If you wanna kill a
public servant, Mr. Maroni...

171
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:28,846
...I recommend you buy American.

172
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:32,389
Get him out of here.
-But, Your Honor, I'm not done.

173
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:39,393
We'll never be able to link the gun
to Maroni, so we can't charge him.

174
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,357
But they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

175
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:45,650
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.

176
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:47,533
Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.

177
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:50,538
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

178
00:15:50,707 --> 00:15:51,904
But, you know...

179
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,415
...if you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.

180
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:58,502
Can't. I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here.

181
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:03,417
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

182
00:16:12,478 --> 00:16:15,264
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

183
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:20,688
It's a shame Sal's going to walk.

184
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:24,904
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

185
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,403
Lightly irradiated bills.

186
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:35,160
Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?

187
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:37,332
We liaise with various agencies...

188
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:39,245
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

189
00:16:39,421 --> 00:16:43,002
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight.

190
00:16:43,175 --> 00:16:45,332
Mm-hm. What about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

191
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:47,917
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...

192
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:51,298
...I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance, counselor.

193
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,136
I've put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...

194
00:16:54,311 --> 00:16:56,682
...but the Mob
is still getting its money out.

195
00:16:56,855 --> 00:17:00,305
I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town.

196
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:03,187
You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

197
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:04,522
It's bold.

198
00:17:05,572 --> 00:17:06,602
You gonna count me in?

199
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:10,524
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

200
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:12,942
I don't like that you got
your own special unit...

201
00:17:13,121 --> 00:17:16,037
...and it's full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs.

202
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:19,041
If I didn't work with cops
you'd investigated while at IA...

203
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,453
...I'd be working alone.

204
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:23,120
I don't get political points
for being an idealist.

205
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:25,704
I do the best I can with what I have.

206
00:17:29,304 --> 00:17:33,051
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...

207
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:35,049
...without telling me what we're after.

208
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:38,716
I can give you the names of the banks.

209
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:40,804
Well, that's a start.

210
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,514
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

211
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:45,351
Oh, you don't have
to sell me, Dent.

212
00:17:45,528 --> 00:17:47,519
We all know you're Gotham's
white knight.

213
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:52,231
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.

214
00:17:52,827 --> 00:17:54,106
I wouldn't know about that.

215
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:59,070
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

216
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,542
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

217
00:18:03,713 --> 00:18:05,621
Well, Mr. Lau...

218
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:08,757
...I speak for the rest of the board...

219
00:18:09,343 --> 00:18:12,259
...and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

220
00:18:17,142 --> 00:18:20,759
Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished...

221
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:23,427
...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.

222
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:26,179
You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.

223
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,647
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

224
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:30,362
It's done.

225
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:32,273
The numbers are solid.

226
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:33,990
Do them again.

227
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:37,242
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, would we?

228
00:18:39,957 --> 00:18:41,580
Another long night?

229
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,702
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.

230
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:46,622
But I'm not convinced.

231
00:18:46,797 --> 00:18:50,461
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.

232
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:53,040
His revenue stream
must be off the books...

233
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,629
...maybe even illegal.

234
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,463
Okay. Cancel the deal.

235
00:18:57,808 --> 00:18:58,969
You already knew.

236
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:02,220
Just needed a closer look at their books.

237
00:19:02,395 --> 00:19:04,433
Anything else you can trouble me for?

238
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:06,439
I need a new suit.

239
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:09,097
Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.

240
00:19:09,277 --> 00:19:12,395
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.

241
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:15,154
You wanna be able to turn your head.

242
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:17,399
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.

243
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:19,410
I'll see what I can do.

244
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:26,123
Took three weeks
to get a reservation here.

245
00:19:26,294 --> 00:19:28,415
I had to tell them
I work for the government.

246
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:29,831
-Really?
-Health inspector's...

247
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:31,249
...not afraid to pull strings.

248
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:33,629
Rachel. Fancy that.

249
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:36,290
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

250
00:19:36,637 --> 00:19:38,794
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.

251
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:44,345
-Natascha. Are you the prima...?
-Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

252
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,852
-Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
-Really? So you're into ballet?

253
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,347
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.

254
00:19:50,693 --> 00:19:54,440
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

255
00:19:54,613 --> 00:19:55,810
I certainly hope not.

256
00:19:56,157 --> 00:19:59,489
-Let's put a couple tables together.
-I'm not sure that they'll let us.

257
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,695
Oh, they should. I own the place.

258
00:20:03,164 --> 00:20:06,116
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?

259
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:08,248
Well, I was raised here.
I turned out okay.

260
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:09,995
Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

261
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,663
Is...? Heh-heh.

262
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,380
The Palisades? Sure.

263
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:16,003
You know, as our new DA,
you might wanna figure out...

264
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:18,001
...where your jurisdiction ends.

265
00:20:18,178 --> 00:20:22,126
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

266
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:25,674
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary
citizen standing up for what's right.

267
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:28,093
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

268
00:20:28,272 --> 00:20:30,228
...not a man who thinks
he's above the law.

269
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:31,560
Who appointed the Batman?

270
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:35,563
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

271
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:37,479
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

272
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:39,398
When their enemies were at the gates...

273
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:43,273
...the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

274
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:46,024
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.

275
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:47,863
Harvey, the last man
that they appointed...

276
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,327
...to protect the republic
was named Caesar...

277
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:53,915
...and he never gave up his power.
-Okay, fine.

278
00:20:54,088 --> 00:20:55,415
You either die a hero...

279
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,624
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

280
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:02,299
Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life.

281
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:05,720
How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.

282
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,178
Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

283
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:11,098
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

284
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:16,512
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader? Hm?

285
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,944
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.

286
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:28,452
Well, I'm sold, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

287
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:31,456
That's nice, but I'm not
up for reelection for three years.

288
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,533
No, you don't understand.

289
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,496
One fundraiser with my pals...

290
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,251
...you'll never need another cent.

291
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,101
What the hell is this?

292
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:00,560
As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.

293
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:04,104
A relatively small amount, 68 million.

294
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,818
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

295
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,693
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

296
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,828
He's not the problem. He's a nobody.

297
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:16,366
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

298
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,033
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well-placed sources...

299
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:22,995
... we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills...

300
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,664
... and are planning to
seize your funds today.

301
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:29,841
And since the enthusiastic new D A has
put all my competitors out of business...

302
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:33,972
...I'm your only option.
MARONl: So, what are you proposing?

303
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,808
Moving all deposits to
one secure location, not a bank.

304
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,938
-Where, then?
-No one can know but me.

305
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,443
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you...

306
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,402
... everyone's money would be at stake.

307
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,693
What stop them getting to you?

308
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,949
I go to Hong Kong,
far from Dent's jurisdiction...

309
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,197
... and the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

310
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,996
MARONl:
How soon can you move the money?

311
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,369
I already have.

312
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,373
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait
for your permission.

313
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:06,670
Rest assured, your money is safe.

314
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,843
Oh, hee-hee, aha.
Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha.

315
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,262
And I thought my jokes were bad.

316
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,524
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy pull your head off.

317
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:25,973
How about a magic trick?

318
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,648
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

319
00:23:33,953 --> 00:23:35,066
Ta-da!

320
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:36,739
It's...

321
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,202
It's gone.

322
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,908
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

323
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:44,920
-You ought to know, you bought it.
Sit.

324
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,042
I want to hear proposition.

325
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,252
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

326
00:23:54,599 --> 00:24:00,268
These cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.

327
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,560
I mean, what happened?

328
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:07,515
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

329
00:24:07,695 --> 00:24:09,733
You see, a guy like me...

330
00:24:10,197 --> 00:24:12,947
-A freak.
Damn right.

331
00:24:13,117 --> 00:24:16,235
A guy like me... Look, listen.

332
00:24:16,787 --> 00:24:21,079
I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem...

333
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,953
...group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.

334
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:27,247
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

335
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:31,124
The Batman.

336
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:36,543
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

337
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:40,222
Dent, he's just the beginning.

338
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:45,555
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

339
00:24:46,024 --> 00:24:47,896
...Batman has no jurisdiction.

340
00:24:48,068 --> 00:24:50,640
He'll find him and make him squeal.

341
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:53,820
I know the squealers when I see them...

342
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:55,649
...and...

343
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,903
What do you propose?

344
00:24:58,078 --> 00:25:00,484
It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

345
00:25:01,832 --> 00:25:04,784
If it's so simple, why haven't
you done it already?

346
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,663
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

347
00:25:08,338 --> 00:25:09,617
How much you want?

348
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,331
Uh, half.

349
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:17,302
You're crazy.
-No, I'm not.

350
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:19,593
No, I'm not.

351
00:25:21,184 --> 00:25:24,598
If we don't deal with this now...

352
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:26,394
...soon...

353
00:25:26,606 --> 00:25:31,516
...little Gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.

354
00:25:32,195 --> 00:25:33,652
Enough from the clown!

355
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:36,773
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...

356
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:39,485
Shit!
...this out of proportion.

357
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,149
You think you can steal from us
and just walk away?

358
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,871
-Yeah.
I'm putting the word out.

359
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,327
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

360
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:49,536
A million alive, so I can teach him
some manners first.

361
00:25:50,838 --> 00:25:53,410
All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...

362
00:25:53,591 --> 00:25:57,338
...when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously?

363
00:25:57,511 --> 00:25:59,383
Here's my card.

364
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:05,472
Mm-mm.

365
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:21,862
You're a hard man to reach.

366
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:27,159
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

367
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:31,293
If you'd have asked,
I could have taken his passport.

368
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:34,129
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.

369
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:37,582
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved...

370
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:38,789
My office?

371
00:26:38,969 --> 00:26:42,633
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

372
00:26:42,806 --> 00:26:45,924
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat.

373
00:26:46,101 --> 00:26:50,642
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

374
00:26:53,441 --> 00:26:55,397
We need Lau back...

375
00:26:55,569 --> 00:26:59,517
...but the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

376
00:26:59,864 --> 00:27:02,567
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

377
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:03,939
I'll get him to sing.

378
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:06,869
We're going after the Mob's life savings.

379
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:08,281
Things will get ugly.

380
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:10,743
I knew the risk when I took this job,
lieutenant.

381
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:12,458
How will you get him back, any...?

382
00:27:15,046 --> 00:27:16,455
He does that.

383
00:27:16,631 --> 00:27:20,129
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.

384
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:23,799
Well, I'm sure that you've always
wanted to go to Hong Kong.

385
00:27:23,972 --> 00:27:26,129
What's wrong with a phone call?

386
00:27:26,307 --> 00:27:29,924
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.

387
00:27:31,145 --> 00:27:32,970
Now, for high-altitude jumps...

388
00:27:33,147 --> 00:27:35,933
...you're going to need oxygen
and stabilizers.

389
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:39,725
Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...

390
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,476
...jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward.

391
00:27:43,115 --> 00:27:45,236
What about getting back into the plane?

392
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:49,239
-I'd recommend a good travel agent.
-Without it landing.

393
00:27:50,414 --> 00:27:53,164
Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

394
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:56,329
The CIA had a program
back in the '60s...

395
00:27:56,504 --> 00:27:59,836
...for getting their people out
of hot spots called Sky Hook.

396
00:28:00,007 --> 00:28:02,675
-We could look into that.
-Yeah.

397
00:28:02,843 --> 00:28:04,501
Okay. Now...

398
00:28:06,013 --> 00:28:08,716
Hardened Kevlar plates
over titanium-dipped...

399
00:28:08,891 --> 00:28:11,012
...tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

400
00:28:11,185 --> 00:28:14,019
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

401
00:28:17,524 --> 00:28:19,681
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

402
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,851
-Yeah.
-Now, there is a tradeoff.

403
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:25,527
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

404
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:28,651
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?

405
00:28:28,827 --> 00:28:30,865
How will it hold up against dogs?

406
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:33,159
We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?

407
00:28:34,374 --> 00:28:36,863
Should do fine against cats.

408
00:28:37,043 --> 00:28:39,164
I found one in Arizona.

409
00:28:39,337 --> 00:28:42,253
A very nice man said he could have it
up and running in a week...

410
00:28:42,424 --> 00:28:43,502
...and he takes cash.

411
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:46,509
-What about the flight crew?
-South Korean smugglers.

412
00:28:46,678 --> 00:28:48,883
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar.

413
00:28:49,055 --> 00:28:51,805
-Did you think of an alibi?
-Oh, yes.

414
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:13,197
I believe this is your plane, sir.

415
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:20,915
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?

416
00:29:22,588 --> 00:29:26,086
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

417
00:29:37,228 --> 00:29:41,058
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

418
00:29:41,232 --> 00:29:43,057
They brought the body.

419
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,947
So, dead, that's 500.

420
00:30:03,921 --> 00:30:05,711
How about alive? Hm?

421
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:12,090
You wanna know how I got these scars?

422
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:17,012
My father was...

423
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:18,640
...a drinker...

424
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:20,052
...and a fiend.

425
00:30:20,895 --> 00:30:25,057
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

426
00:30:25,483 --> 00:30:28,269
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

427
00:30:28,444 --> 00:30:29,985
He doesn't like that...

428
00:30:30,154 --> 00:30:33,604
...not one bit.

429
00:30:33,782 --> 00:30:36,318
So, me watching...

430
00:30:36,493 --> 00:30:41,070
...he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

431
00:30:41,248 --> 00:30:44,331
He turns to me and he says:

432
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:48,165
"Why so serious?"

433
00:30:48,422 --> 00:30:49,998
He comes at me with the knife.

434
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:52,582
"Why so serious?"

435
00:30:54,845 --> 00:30:57,714
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

436
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:01,969
"Let's put a smile on that face."

437
00:31:03,186 --> 00:31:05,391
And...

438
00:31:07,774 --> 00:31:09,315
Why so serious?

439
00:31:14,364 --> 00:31:15,857
Now...

440
00:31:16,032 --> 00:31:18,272
...our operation is small...

441
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:21,367
...but there is a lot of potential...

442
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:24,074
...for aggressive expansion.

443
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,451
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

444
00:31:27,627 --> 00:31:32,038
Oh. There's only one spot open
right now, so we're gonna have...

445
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:34,872
...tryouts.

446
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:41,463
Make it fast.

447
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,309
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

448
00:31:52,485 --> 00:31:55,188
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.

449
00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:57,271
I understand.

450
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:10,664
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile.

451
00:32:10,836 --> 00:32:12,412
Of course.

452
00:32:15,174 --> 00:32:18,873
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

453
00:32:19,053 --> 00:32:22,586
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

454
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:25,301
...I couldn't let it threaten my company.
-Of course.

455
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:28,641
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

456
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:32,760
...with you here now, we can continue.

457
00:32:32,941 --> 00:32:36,688
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...

458
00:32:38,238 --> 00:32:40,063
We do not allow cell phones in here.

459
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,943
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

460
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:47,743
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

461
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:51,373
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

462
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:54,458
...whatever it is you're accused of being.

463
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:57,201
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

464
00:32:57,382 --> 00:33:01,295
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

465
00:33:01,469 --> 00:33:04,836
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.

466
00:33:05,015 --> 00:33:06,638
Just accidentally wasting it.

467
00:33:07,642 --> 00:33:11,804
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

468
00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:13,932
Hey, sir.

469
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:34,157
There's a better view
from the peak tram.

470
00:33:34,335 --> 00:33:36,160
How's the view from LSI Holdings?

471
00:33:36,462 --> 00:33:38,003
Restricted.

472
00:33:38,172 --> 00:33:40,163
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

473
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:42,249
-What's this?
-I had R & D work it up.

474
00:33:42,426 --> 00:33:44,084
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

475
00:33:44,262 --> 00:33:47,096
...records the response time
for mapping an environment.

476
00:33:47,598 --> 00:33:50,170
Sonar. Just like a...

477
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:52,508
Submarine, Mr. Wayne.
Like a submarine.

478
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,845
-And the other device?
-It's in place.

479
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:56,803
Mr. Wayne?

480
00:33:58,025 --> 00:33:59,304
Good luck.

481
00:37:49,295 --> 00:37:52,460
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

482
00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:55,915
The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

483
00:37:56,093 --> 00:38:00,219
Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?

484
00:38:00,389 --> 00:38:02,095
-Are you threatening my client?
-No.

485
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:06,476
I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.

486
00:38:08,105 --> 00:38:09,763
As will everyone.

487
00:38:11,108 --> 00:38:14,440
No? Okay.

488
00:38:14,903 --> 00:38:17,902
Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.

489
00:38:18,073 --> 00:38:19,566
Wait!

490
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:21,774
I won't give you the money...

491
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,951
...but I will give you my clients,
all of them.

492
00:38:25,247 --> 00:38:27,452
You were a glorified accountant.

493
00:38:27,624 --> 00:38:31,454
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

494
00:38:31,628 --> 00:38:35,458
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.

495
00:38:35,632 --> 00:38:37,208
One big pot.

496
00:38:38,593 --> 00:38:39,920
Got it.

497
00:38:40,345 --> 00:38:42,170
One minute.

498
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:45,675
RICO. If they pooled their money...

499
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,640
...we can charge them
as one criminal conspiracy.

500
00:38:47,811 --> 00:38:48,972
Charge them with what?

501
00:38:49,145 --> 00:38:52,014
In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of them with a felony...

502
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,762
You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.

503
00:38:56,152 --> 00:38:58,060
Mr. Lau.

504
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:03,068
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?

505
00:39:03,242 --> 00:39:04,865
-Ledgers...?
-Immunity, protection...

506
00:39:05,036 --> 00:39:08,486
...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
-After you testify in open court.

507
00:39:08,664 --> 00:39:10,988
I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...

508
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:13,539
...what's gonna happen
with all that money?

509
00:39:13,711 --> 00:39:16,829
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

510
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:21,666
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

511
00:39:21,844 --> 00:39:24,380
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

512
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,348
Well, you trust them over at County?

513
00:39:27,516 --> 00:39:29,341
I don't trust them here.

514
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:32,596
Lau stays.

515
00:39:33,063 --> 00:39:35,635
Well, I don 't know about
Mr. Lau's travel arrangements...

516
00:39:35,816 --> 00:39:37,606
... but I'm sure glad he's back.

517
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,229
Put word out. We hire the clown.

518
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:46,861
He was right.
We have to fix real problem.

519
00:39:47,368 --> 00:39:48,481
Batman.

520
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,953
-I'm not aware of any participation...
-Our boy looks good on the tube.

521
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:00,211
You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends?

522
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:04,045
Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.

523
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:12,716
Have a nice trip. See you next fall.

524
00:40:12,893 --> 00:40:14,718
Seven hundred
twelve counts of extortion.

525
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:17,301
Eight hundred and forty-nine
counts of racketeering.

526
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,017
Two hundred and forty-six
counts of fraud.

527
00:40:20,192 --> 00:40:23,026
Eighty-seven counts
of conspiracy murder.

528
00:40:23,946 --> 00:40:27,064
Five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice.

529
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:28,865
How do the defendants plead?

530
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:37,071
Order in the court.

531
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:39,740
Five hundred and forty-nine
criminals at once.

532
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,409
How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce?

533
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:46,715
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

534
00:40:46,885 --> 00:40:49,920
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo...

535
00:40:50,097 --> 00:40:52,669
...you're gonna set
a new record at appeals.

536
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:55,338
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.

537
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,925
But the midlevel guys, they can't.

538
00:40:58,104 --> 00:40:59,929
They can't afford to be off the streets.

539
00:41:00,106 --> 00:41:02,227
They'll cut deals that
include some jail time.

540
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,399
Think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets.

541
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:10,064
Mr. Mayor, you can't...
-No, get out. Both of you.

542
00:41:14,245 --> 00:41:15,786
Sit down.

543
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:23,751
The public likes you. That's the
only reason that this might fly.

544
00:41:23,922 --> 00:41:25,249
But that means it's on you.

545
00:41:25,423 --> 00:41:28,458
They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.

546
00:41:28,634 --> 00:41:32,464
Politicians, journalists, cops.

547
00:41:32,638 --> 00:41:35,127
Anyone whose wallet's
about to get lighter.

548
00:41:35,308 --> 00:41:37,976
Are you up to it? You'd better be.

549
00:41:38,144 --> 00:41:40,265
Because they get anything on you...

550
00:41:40,438 --> 00:41:45,229
...and those criminals are back on the
streets, followed swiftly by you and me.

551
00:41:45,401 --> 00:41:46,680
Jesus!

552
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,294
I think your fundraiser
will be a great success, sir.

553
00:42:10,467 --> 00:42:13,135
And why do you think I wanna
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

554
00:42:13,303 --> 00:42:16,386
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself...

555
00:42:16,557 --> 00:42:18,595
...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:

556
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:20,557
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

557
00:42:20,727 --> 00:42:24,806
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.

558
00:42:24,982 --> 00:42:27,851
Police released video
footage found concealed on the body.

559
00:42:28,026 --> 00:42:30,646
Sensitive viewers, be aware.
The image is disturbing.

560
00:42:30,821 --> 00:42:33,026
Tell them your name.

561
00:42:33,198 --> 00:42:34,856
Brian Douglas.

562
00:42:36,451 --> 00:42:38,775
And are you the real Batman?

563
00:42:38,954 --> 00:42:39,984
No.
No?

564
00:42:40,163 --> 00:42:42,119
-No.
-No?

565
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,996
Then why do you dress up like him?

566
00:42:45,544 --> 00:42:46,574
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

567
00:42:46,753 --> 00:42:50,832
Because he's a symbol that we
don 't have to be afraid of scum like you.

568
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,339
Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.

569
00:42:54,511 --> 00:42:58,128
Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, shh.

570
00:42:58,306 --> 00:43:02,765
So you think Batman 's
made Gotham a better place? Hm?

571
00:43:02,977 --> 00:43:04,518
Look at me.

572
00:43:04,687 --> 00:43:06,974
Look at me!

573
00:43:10,735 --> 00:43:14,233
You see, this is how crazy
Batman 's made Gotham.

574
00:43:14,405 --> 00:43:16,692
You want order in Gotham...

575
00:43:17,033 --> 00:43:21,444
... Batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in.

576
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:25,403
Oh, and every day he doesn 't,
people will die.

577
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,871
Starting tonight.

578
00:43:28,294 --> 00:43:30,499
I'm a man of my word.

579
00:43:47,771 --> 00:43:50,605
Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld...

580
00:43:50,774 --> 00:43:53,857
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

581
00:43:54,028 --> 00:43:55,271
-I'll be back.
-Rachel.

582
00:43:55,446 --> 00:43:58,280
A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?

583
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:00,855
-Thank you. Alfred, right?
-That's right, sir.

584
00:44:01,035 --> 00:44:04,319
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life.

585
00:44:04,496 --> 00:44:05,739
Not yet, sir.

586
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:10,281
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

587
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,700
Oh, you have no idea.

588
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:33,057
I'm sorry that I'm late.

589
00:44:33,233 --> 00:44:35,604
I'm glad to see
that you all got started without me.

590
00:44:35,777 --> 00:44:39,476
Now, where is Harvey? Where...?

591
00:44:39,656 --> 00:44:42,062
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

592
00:44:42,242 --> 00:44:43,569
Where's Rachel Dawes?

593
00:44:43,743 --> 00:44:46,114
She is my oldest friend. Come here.

594
00:44:46,287 --> 00:44:48,776
When Rachel first told me she
was dating Harvey Dent...

595
00:44:48,957 --> 00:44:50,154
...I had one thing to say:

596
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,781
"The guy from those God-awful
campaign commercials?"

597
00:44:52,961 --> 00:44:56,791
"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

598
00:44:56,965 --> 00:44:58,956
But it caught Rachel's attention.

599
00:44:59,133 --> 00:45:02,132
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey...

600
00:45:02,553 --> 00:45:05,837
...and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.

601
00:45:06,015 --> 00:45:07,805
And you know what?

602
00:45:09,852 --> 00:45:11,345
I believe in Harvey Dent.

603
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:15,102
I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...

604
00:45:15,274 --> 00:45:18,938
...a little safer, a little more optimistic.

605
00:45:20,363 --> 00:45:24,691
Look at this face. This is the face
of Gotham's bright future.

606
00:45:24,867 --> 00:45:27,024
To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.

607
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:28,952
Harvey.

608
00:45:38,464 --> 00:45:39,921
Harvey may not know you
well enough...

609
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:42,046
...to understand you're
making fun of him...

610
00:45:42,218 --> 00:45:44,209
...but I do.
-No, I meant every word.

611
00:45:45,554 --> 00:45:48,470
You know that day
that you once told me about...

612
00:45:48,641 --> 00:45:50,715
...when Gotham would no longer
need Batman?

613
00:45:50,893 --> 00:45:52,801
-It's coming.
-Bruce.

614
00:45:53,645 --> 00:45:59,230
-You can't ask me to wait for that.
-It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

615
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:03,860
He locked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

616
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,236
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

617
00:46:07,075 --> 00:46:09,362
You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.

618
00:46:10,746 --> 00:46:12,654
Thanks again.

619
00:46:13,457 --> 00:46:15,163
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

620
00:46:18,628 --> 00:46:20,999
Lieutenant, that joker card
pinned to the body?

621
00:46:21,173 --> 00:46:22,915
Forensics found three sets of DNA.

622
00:46:23,091 --> 00:46:24,500
-Any matches?
-All three.

623
00:46:24,676 --> 00:46:28,174
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

624
00:46:28,346 --> 00:46:30,337
The Joker's telling us
who he's targeting.

625
00:46:30,515 --> 00:46:33,384
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

626
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,598
Protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

627
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:37,263
-City hall.
-Seal the building.

628
00:46:37,439 --> 00:46:39,430
-No one in or out till I get there.
-Got it.

629
00:46:51,744 --> 00:46:54,115
Gordon. What are you up to?

630
00:46:54,288 --> 00:46:57,537
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor
search of the entire building.

631
00:46:57,709 --> 00:47:00,281
We believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.

632
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:01,870
These are dangerous people.

633
00:47:02,046 --> 00:47:03,788
You're not giving me
a lot of information.

634
00:47:03,965 --> 00:47:05,921
Even we don't know
where you're going.

635
00:47:06,092 --> 00:47:09,424
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

636
00:47:13,265 --> 00:47:15,173
You can't leave me alone
with these people.

637
00:47:15,351 --> 00:47:18,386
The whole Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?

638
00:47:18,562 --> 00:47:20,518
Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

639
00:47:20,689 --> 00:47:24,270
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...

640
00:47:24,443 --> 00:47:28,522
...take my word, the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats.

641
00:47:28,697 --> 00:47:34,235
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

642
00:47:34,453 --> 00:47:36,693
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

643
00:47:36,872 --> 00:47:38,199
Yeah, I bet.

644
00:47:38,374 --> 00:47:42,666
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...

645
00:47:42,836 --> 00:47:44,827
...about who you wanna
spend your life with.

646
00:47:45,005 --> 00:47:48,004
-That's a pretty big commitment.
-Not if the Mob has their way.

647
00:47:53,222 --> 00:47:55,925
You get to explain to my wife...

648
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:58,426
...why I'm late for dinner.

649
00:47:58,602 --> 00:48:01,767
Sir, the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

650
00:48:03,356 --> 00:48:05,976
-Don't do that.
-All right.

651
00:48:06,526 --> 00:48:09,442
-Let's be serious, then.
-Okay.

652
00:48:09,779 --> 00:48:10,809
What's your answer?

653
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:18,488
I don't have an answer.

654
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:21,695
How'd they get my DNA?

655
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:24,032
Somebody with access
to your office or house...

656
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:26,830
...must have lifted a tissue
or a glass... Wait! Wait!

657
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,921
-Well, I guess no answer is a no.
-Harvey.

658
00:48:30,091 --> 00:48:32,212
-It's someone else, isn't it?
-Harvey.

659
00:48:32,385 --> 00:48:35,550
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f...

660
00:48:36,055 --> 00:48:37,512
What are you doing?

661
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:49,723
Oh, shit.

662
00:48:55,908 --> 00:48:57,650
Get a medic!

663
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,193
They've come for him.

664
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:04,869
We made it.

665
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,490
Stay hidden.

666
00:49:10,755 --> 00:49:14,087
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

667
00:49:17,011 --> 00:49:20,924
We are tonight's entertainment.

668
00:49:21,766 --> 00:49:24,090
I only have one question:

669
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:27,843
Where is Harvey Dent?

670
00:49:37,323 --> 00:49:39,397
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

671
00:49:39,575 --> 00:49:40,854
Hands up, pretty boy.

672
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,786
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him.

673
00:49:50,961 --> 00:49:53,795
Just something little, huh? No.

674
00:49:56,091 --> 00:49:58,841
What's going on out there? Wayne!

675
00:50:00,304 --> 00:50:01,678
Oh, thank God, you've
got a panic room.

676
00:50:01,847 --> 00:50:03,008
Hey, wait...

677
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,389
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

678
00:50:05,684 --> 00:50:07,675
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

679
00:50:07,853 --> 00:50:11,351
We're not intimidated by thugs.

680
00:50:12,316 --> 00:50:14,022
You know...

681
00:50:15,652 --> 00:50:18,651
...you remind me of my father.

682
00:50:19,114 --> 00:50:20,939
I hated my father.

683
00:50:21,116 --> 00:50:23,154
Okay, stop.

684
00:50:26,997 --> 00:50:29,831
Well, hello, beautiful.

685
00:50:32,002 --> 00:50:35,832
You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?

686
00:50:36,214 --> 00:50:38,703
And you are beautiful.

687
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:49,506
You look nervous. Is it the scars?

688
00:50:50,437 --> 00:50:52,642
You wanna know how I got them?

689
00:50:53,857 --> 00:50:56,393
Come here. Hey.

690
00:50:56,776 --> 00:50:58,482
Look at me.

691
00:50:58,945 --> 00:51:03,689
So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...

692
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:08,160
...who tells me I worry too much...

693
00:51:08,329 --> 00:51:11,245
...who tells me I ought to smile more...

694
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:16,919
...who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

695
00:51:17,338 --> 00:51:19,744
One day they carve her face.

696
00:51:20,258 --> 00:51:24,503
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

697
00:51:24,887 --> 00:51:28,385
I just wanna see her smile again. Hm?

698
00:51:28,724 --> 00:51:31,640
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

699
00:51:32,186 --> 00:51:33,727
So...

700
00:51:34,313 --> 00:51:37,977
...I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

701
00:51:38,442 --> 00:51:39,816
...to myself.

702
00:51:40,111 --> 00:51:45,186
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

703
00:51:45,366 --> 00:51:46,907
She leaves.

704
00:51:47,618 --> 00:51:50,024
Now I see the funny side.

705
00:51:50,913 --> 00:51:52,489
Now I'm always smiling.

706
00:51:55,918 --> 00:51:59,250
You got a little fight in you. I like that.

707
00:51:59,421 --> 00:52:00,748
Then you're gonna love me.

708
00:52:28,909 --> 00:52:30,106
Drop the gun.

709
00:52:30,285 --> 00:52:32,905
Oh, sure. You just take off
your little mask...

710
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:35,284
...and show us all who
you really are. Hm?

711
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,117
Let her go.

712
00:52:42,922 --> 00:52:44,331
Very poor choice of words.

713
00:53:07,155 --> 00:53:09,027
Are you all right?

714
00:53:11,284 --> 00:53:13,655
Let's not do that again.

715
00:53:13,953 --> 00:53:16,442
-Is Harvey okay?
-He's safe.

716
00:53:17,999 --> 00:53:19,326
Thank you.

717
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:20,697
Jim, it's over.

718
00:53:20,876 --> 00:53:23,448
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

719
00:53:23,629 --> 00:53:25,122
The prosecution's over.

720
00:53:25,297 --> 00:53:26,955
Nobody's standing up
in front of a judge...

721
00:53:27,133 --> 00:53:30,132
...while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away.

722
00:53:30,302 --> 00:53:32,092
-What about Dent?
-He's got any sense...

723
00:53:32,263 --> 00:53:33,341
...Dent's halfway to Mex...

724
00:53:33,514 --> 00:53:35,090
So where do you keep your trash?

725
00:53:36,433 --> 00:53:40,381
You're due in court. I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.

726
00:53:40,562 --> 00:53:43,597
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

727
00:53:43,774 --> 00:53:47,106
You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.

728
00:53:47,277 --> 00:53:49,731
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

729
00:53:51,156 --> 00:53:52,649
Targeting me won't get their money.

730
00:53:52,825 --> 00:53:54,650
I knew the Mob wouldn't go
down easily...

731
00:53:54,827 --> 00:53:56,901
...but this is different.
They crossed a line.

732
00:53:57,079 --> 00:53:58,322
You crossed the line first.

733
00:53:58,497 --> 00:54:01,911
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

734
00:54:02,084 --> 00:54:07,077
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

735
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:10,125
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

736
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,505
We just need to figure out
what he's after.

737
00:54:12,677 --> 00:54:14,086
With respect, Master Wayne...

738
00:54:14,262 --> 00:54:17,214
...perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

739
00:54:18,016 --> 00:54:20,719
A long time ago, I was in Burma...

740
00:54:20,894 --> 00:54:24,308
...and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

741
00:54:24,481 --> 00:54:27,053
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

742
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:30,067
...by bribing them with
precious stones...

743
00:54:30,236 --> 00:54:34,813
...but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

744
00:54:34,991 --> 00:54:38,275
So we went looking for the stones.

745
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:43,784
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

746
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:48,413
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

747
00:54:48,588 --> 00:54:51,623
...the size of a tangerine.

748
00:54:51,883 --> 00:54:55,250
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

749
00:54:55,928 --> 00:54:58,631
-So why steal them?
-Because he thought it was good sport.

750
00:54:58,806 --> 00:55:03,762
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

751
00:55:03,936 --> 00:55:08,181
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

752
00:55:08,608 --> 00:55:12,438
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

753
00:55:32,881 --> 00:55:34,042
Your name, sir?

754
00:55:34,216 --> 00:55:37,381
Eighth and Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.

755
00:55:50,274 --> 00:55:51,731
Check the names.

756
00:55:58,323 --> 00:56:00,029
"Richard Dent."

757
00:56:02,244 --> 00:56:03,322
"Patrick Harvey."

758
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,650
Harvey Dent.

759
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:07,829
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

760
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:10,246
It's because of you
these guys are dead...

761
00:56:10,418 --> 00:56:11,959
Detective!

762
00:56:14,172 --> 00:56:16,210
Give us a minute, guys.

763
00:56:17,425 --> 00:56:19,001
That's brick underneath.

764
00:56:19,344 --> 00:56:21,002
Gonna take ballistics
off a shattered bullet?

765
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:22,802
No.

766
00:56:24,265 --> 00:56:26,173
Fingerprints.

767
00:56:34,734 --> 00:56:36,642
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

768
00:56:38,446 --> 00:56:43,153
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

769
00:57:00,468 --> 00:57:02,755
I'm not sure
you made it loud enough, sir.

770
00:57:15,858 --> 00:57:17,979
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

771
00:57:18,152 --> 00:57:21,934
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again.

772
00:57:22,614 --> 00:57:24,901
Well, I found some irregularities.

773
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:27,399
Their CEO is in police custody.

774
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:30,494
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

775
00:57:30,706 --> 00:57:33,789
Applied Sciences. Whole division
of Wayne Enterprises...

776
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:35,617
...just disappeared overnight.

777
00:57:35,794 --> 00:57:40,039
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.

778
00:57:41,174 --> 00:57:43,046
Don't tell me you didn't
recognize your baby...

779
00:57:43,218 --> 00:57:46,835
...pancaking cop cars
on the evening news.

780
00:57:47,139 --> 00:57:50,341
Now you got the entire R & D
Department burning through cash...

781
00:57:50,517 --> 00:57:53,849
...claiming it's related to
cell phones for the Army?

782
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:57,103
What are you building for him now,
a rocket ship?

783
00:57:58,984 --> 00:58:00,726
I want...

784
00:58:00,902 --> 00:58:04,815
...$ 10 million a year
for the rest of my life.

785
00:58:07,325 --> 00:58:09,446
Let me get this straight.

786
00:58:10,662 --> 00:58:13,116
You think that your client...

787
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:16,372
One of the wealthiest,
most powerful men in the world...

788
00:58:16,543 --> 00:58:18,119
...is secretly a vigilante...

789
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:22,954
...who spends his nights beating
criminals to a pulp with his bare hands...

790
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:26,297
...and your plan
is to blackmail this person?

791
00:58:33,767 --> 00:58:35,046
Good luck.

792
00:58:37,938 --> 00:58:39,347
When...

793
00:58:40,774 --> 00:58:42,231
Keep that.

794
00:58:48,907 --> 00:58:51,361
This is your original scan.

795
00:58:52,786 --> 00:58:55,073
Here it is reengineered.

796
00:59:03,296 --> 00:59:06,829
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.

797
00:59:08,843 --> 00:59:10,004
I'll get you a copy.

798
00:59:10,219 --> 00:59:14,001
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R & D?

799
00:59:14,182 --> 00:59:16,671
Yeah. Government
telecommunications project.

800
00:59:16,851 --> 00:59:18,889
Wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.

801
00:59:19,145 --> 00:59:22,144
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.

802
00:59:23,274 --> 00:59:24,980
Fair enough.

803
00:59:27,903 --> 00:59:29,360
With no word
from the Batman...

804
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:31,023
...even as they mourn
Commissioner Loeb...

805
00:59:31,198 --> 00:59:34,565
...these cops have to wonder if
the Joker will make good on his threat...

806
00:59:34,744 --> 00:59:37,946
...in the obituary column of
The Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

807
00:59:39,748 --> 00:59:43,412
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

808
00:59:43,586 --> 00:59:45,707
Cross-reference the addresses.

809
00:59:45,879 --> 00:59:49,875
Look for Parkside,
overlooking the parade.

810
00:59:51,093 --> 00:59:52,206
I got one.

811
00:59:52,386 --> 00:59:56,382
Melvin White,
1502 Randolph Apartments.

812
00:59:56,765 --> 01:00:00,844
Aggravated assault,
moved to Arkham twice.

813
01:00:39,933 --> 01:00:41,509
What do you got on the roof?

814
01:00:41,684 --> 01:00:45,217
We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.

815
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:57,823
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...

816
01:00:57,992 --> 01:01:00,279
...and to the protection
of his community.

817
01:01:00,453 --> 01:01:02,243
I remember when I first took office...

818
01:01:02,413 --> 01:01:04,949
...and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.

819
01:01:05,124 --> 01:01:10,365
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

820
01:01:14,133 --> 01:01:17,298
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

821
01:01:18,471 --> 01:01:21,969
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

822
01:01:22,141 --> 01:01:25,390
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters...

823
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:31,431
-Who's that?
-What happened?

824
01:01:32,484 --> 01:01:34,356
They took our guns.

825
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:36,318
And our uniforms.

826
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:45,661
And as we recognize
the sacrifice of this man...

827
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:49,779
...we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

828
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,449
Stand by. Honor guard.

829
01:01:52,629 --> 01:01:56,246
Attention. Port arms.

830
01:01:57,467 --> 01:02:01,843
Ready! Aim! Fire!

831
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:04,180
Ready! Aim!

832
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:10,182
Ready! Aim!

833
01:02:18,613 --> 01:02:20,022
Stay down! Don't move!

834
01:02:21,866 --> 01:02:23,524
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

835
01:02:32,752 --> 01:02:34,992
-I'll see you later.
-Why are you going back?

836
01:02:47,642 --> 01:02:48,672
Get out of here.

837
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:54,472
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

838
01:03:25,512 --> 01:03:26,839
No.

839
01:03:27,264 --> 01:03:28,591
I'm sorry, Barbara.

840
01:03:29,516 --> 01:03:32,765
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.

841
01:03:32,936 --> 01:03:35,176
If there's anything
we can do, anything you need...

842
01:03:35,355 --> 01:03:37,097
...we're here for you.

843
01:03:38,692 --> 01:03:40,600
Shh.

844
01:03:40,777 --> 01:03:42,020
Are you out there?

845
01:03:43,363 --> 01:03:47,858
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

846
01:03:48,035 --> 01:03:50,406
You brought this on us!

847
01:03:51,455 --> 01:03:56,032
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.

848
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:59,459
God help whoever
he does wanna talk to.

849
01:04:01,131 --> 01:04:04,047
Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

850
01:04:04,217 --> 01:04:07,051
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?

851
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,250
What?

852
01:04:37,667 --> 01:04:39,290
-Yeah?
Second.

853
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:40,490
Okay.

854
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:42,827
-Harvey, where are you?
Where are you?

855
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:45,126
I'm where you should be,
at Major Crimes.

856
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:46,840
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

857
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:50,590
-Can I get the fingerprint analysis?
-Rachel, listen. You're not safe there.

858
01:04:50,763 --> 01:04:52,553
-This is Gordon's unit.
-Gordon 's gone.

859
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:56,304
He vouched for these men.
-And he's gone.

860
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:03,014
The Joker's named you next.

861
01:05:03,192 --> 01:05:06,191
God, is there someone, is there anyone
in this town we can trust?

862
01:05:06,362 --> 01:05:08,068
Bruce.

863
01:05:08,364 --> 01:05:09,525
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

864
01:05:09,698 --> 01:05:11,274
No. Rachel, I know
you're his friend, but...

865
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:13,275
Harvey, trust me.

866
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:16,202
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

867
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:17,699
Then you go straight there.

868
01:05:17,873 --> 01:05:19,994
Don 't tell anybody
and I'll find you there.

869
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:21,873
I love you.

870
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:37,134
I want the Joker.

871
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:40,010
From one professional to another...

872
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:42,723
...you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

873
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:45,470
From this height,
the fall wouldn't kill me.

874
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,226
-I'm counting on it.
-Huh!

875
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:57,736
-Where is he?
-I don't know where he is. He found us.

876
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,191
He must have friends.

877
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,826
Friends? Have you met this guy?

878
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,576
Someone knows where he is.

879
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:06,241
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

880
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:07,748
They're wise to your act.

881
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:11,918
You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.

882
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:16,967
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

883
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,930
But you already know what that is.

884
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,886
Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.

885
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:27,600
Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind.

886
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,268
You wanna play games?

887
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:38,607
How's that feel?

888
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:41,406
-You wouldn't.
-I wouldn't!

889
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,538
-You don't think I will?
-Mm-mm.

890
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,747
-You don't think I will?
-Mm-mm.

891
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:51,331
No. No, I wouldn't.

892
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,086
That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.

893
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:59,094
Heads, you get to keep your head.

894
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,138
Tails...

895
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:03,131
...not so lucky.

896
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:07,052
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

897
01:07:16,448 --> 01:07:20,147
-Let's go again.
-I don't know anything! God, don't!

898
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:22,698
You're not playing the odds, friend.

899
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:25,821
Let's do it again.

900
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:30,494
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

901
01:07:31,254 --> 01:07:34,835
-Not exactly.
-His name's Schiff, Thomas.

902
01:07:35,008 --> 01:07:38,007
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

903
01:07:38,178 --> 01:07:42,803
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

904
01:07:46,144 --> 01:07:48,930
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

905
01:07:49,105 --> 01:07:51,891
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

906
01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:53,892
Your stand against organized crime...

907
01:07:54,069 --> 01:07:57,271
...is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.

908
01:07:57,447 --> 01:08:01,064
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

909
01:08:01,241 --> 01:08:03,528
The criminals you arrested
would be released...

910
01:08:03,702 --> 01:08:06,785
...and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.

911
01:08:07,414 --> 01:08:09,654
You're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.

912
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:12,204
-Why?
-No one else will die because of me.

913
01:08:12,377 --> 01:08:14,701
Gotham's in your hands now.

914
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,586
You can't.

915
01:08:16,756 --> 01:08:18,130
You can't give in.

916
01:08:18,425 --> 01:08:20,961
You can't give in!

917
01:08:36,317 --> 01:08:37,560
Harvey called.

918
01:08:37,735 --> 01:08:40,770
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.

919
01:08:40,947 --> 01:08:42,060
I have no choice.

920
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:45,323
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

921
01:08:45,493 --> 01:08:48,943
Maybe not. But I have enough blood
on my hands.

922
01:08:49,414 --> 01:08:54,240
And I've seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him.

923
01:08:54,794 --> 01:08:58,244
You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished...

924
01:08:58,423 --> 01:09:00,497
...that we'd be together.

925
01:09:01,217 --> 01:09:04,382
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.

926
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:07,257
Did you mean it?

927
01:09:08,766 --> 01:09:10,591
Yes.

928
01:09:27,868 --> 01:09:29,658
Bruce.

929
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:34,534
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

930
01:09:45,177 --> 01:09:48,129
Logs as well?
Everything.

931
01:09:48,305 --> 01:09:51,672
Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel.

932
01:09:57,022 --> 01:10:00,306
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

933
01:10:00,484 --> 01:10:04,231
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

934
01:10:04,404 --> 01:10:08,103
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

935
01:10:08,283 --> 01:10:13,821
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

936
01:10:13,997 --> 01:10:15,324
The right choice.

937
01:10:15,832 --> 01:10:18,867
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

938
01:10:19,044 --> 01:10:20,287
He can't endure this.

939
01:10:20,587 --> 01:10:23,456
Today you get to say "I told you so."

940
01:10:24,048 --> 01:10:27,213
Today, I don't want to.

941
01:10:33,057 --> 01:10:34,514
But I did bloody tell you.

942
01:10:37,562 --> 01:10:40,561
I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well...

943
01:10:41,357 --> 01:10:42,600
...as your accomplice.

944
01:10:42,775 --> 01:10:47,519
Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

945
01:10:51,784 --> 01:10:55,317
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called
this press conference for two reasons.

946
01:10:55,496 --> 01:10:57,534
Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

947
01:10:57,707 --> 01:11:01,371
...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

948
01:11:02,753 --> 01:11:05,836
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

949
01:11:06,006 --> 01:11:07,712
But let's consider the situation.

950
01:11:08,092 --> 01:11:10,712
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

951
01:11:10,886 --> 01:11:12,343
Do we really think he's gonna...?

952
01:11:12,513 --> 01:11:15,880
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

953
01:11:16,058 --> 01:11:18,429
The Batman is an outlaw.

954
01:11:19,311 --> 01:11:21,219
That's not why we demand
he turn himself in...

955
01:11:21,397 --> 01:11:23,055
...we're doing it because we're scared.

956
01:11:23,232 --> 01:11:26,018
We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now.

957
01:11:26,193 --> 01:11:29,145
Things are worse than ever!
Amen.

958
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:32,397
Yes, they are.

959
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:37,909
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

960
01:11:40,374 --> 01:11:42,448
And I promise you...

961
01:11:43,251 --> 01:11:44,660
...the dawn is coming.

962
01:11:44,836 --> 01:11:49,377
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

963
01:11:49,549 --> 01:11:51,291
...not to this madman.

964
01:11:51,468 --> 01:11:53,792
-No more dead cops!
Yeah!

965
01:11:57,098 --> 01:11:58,674
He should turn himself in!

966
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:01,553
Give us the Batman! Come on!
Where is he?

967
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:06,596
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.

968
01:12:07,067 --> 01:12:09,023
What?
Is he here?

969
01:12:09,736 --> 01:12:10,766
I am the Batman.

970
01:12:11,112 --> 01:12:14,111
What?
Come on.

971
01:12:22,498 --> 01:12:24,406
Alfred.

972
01:12:25,752 --> 01:12:27,542
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

973
01:12:27,712 --> 01:12:30,711
-He went down to the press conference.
-I know. He just stood by.

974
01:12:30,882 --> 01:12:32,956
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...

975
01:12:33,134 --> 01:12:36,133
...believe that Batman stands for
something more important...

976
01:12:36,304 --> 01:12:38,628
...than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...

977
01:12:38,806 --> 01:12:40,797
...even if everyone hates him for it.

978
01:12:40,975 --> 01:12:43,096
That's the sacrifice he's making.

979
01:12:43,269 --> 01:12:46,886
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

980
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,063
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

981
01:12:49,233 --> 01:12:52,316
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

982
01:12:54,989 --> 01:12:56,612
You know him better than anyone.

983
01:12:57,032 --> 01:12:58,062
I do.

984
01:13:01,453 --> 01:13:04,488
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

985
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:07,155
How will I know?

986
01:13:07,334 --> 01:13:08,827
It's not sealed.

987
01:13:10,254 --> 01:13:11,795
Goodbye, Alfred.

988
01:13:15,968 --> 01:13:17,710
Bye, Rachel.

989
01:13:25,602 --> 01:13:27,427
I didn't have time to talk this through.

990
01:13:27,604 --> 01:13:28,847
What are you doing?

991
01:13:29,022 --> 01:13:31,096
They're transferring me
to Central Holding.

992
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:35,064
This is the Joker's chance, and when he
attacks, the Batman will take him down.

993
01:13:35,237 --> 01:13:36,778
Listen. This is too dangerous.

994
01:13:36,947 --> 01:13:40,646
We get this guy to County, he's their
problem. The streets will be cleared...

995
01:13:40,826 --> 01:13:44,525
...so let's go.
The convoys stop for no reason.

996
01:13:44,704 --> 01:13:46,161
I hope you got some moves, pal.

997
01:13:46,331 --> 01:13:49,247
He's using you as bait. He doesn't
know if he can get the Joker.

998
01:13:49,417 --> 01:13:50,495
He's failed so far.

999
01:13:50,835 --> 01:13:52,376
How do you know
what he's thinking?

1000
01:13:52,545 --> 01:13:54,869
I just do. Anyway,
this isn't just about you.

1001
01:13:55,048 --> 01:13:56,873
What about the people
depending on you...

1002
01:13:57,050 --> 01:14:00,049
...to clean the city up
and do it honorably and...?

1003
01:14:05,725 --> 01:14:08,345
Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.

1004
01:14:08,728 --> 01:14:10,600
Heads, I go through with it.

1005
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:12,721
This is your life. You can't leave...

1006
01:14:12,899 --> 01:14:15,270
...something like that to chance.
-I'm not.

1007
01:14:19,614 --> 01:14:22,020
You make your own luck.

1008
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,837
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.

1009
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,804
What the hell is that?

1010
01:14:55,983 --> 01:14:58,188
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

1011
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,562
Damn it! All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.

1012
01:15:01,989 --> 01:15:03,102
Exit down!

1013
01:15:03,282 --> 01:15:05,606
Lower Fifth? We'll be
like turkeys on Thanksgiving.

1014
01:15:38,316 --> 01:15:40,640
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.

1015
01:15:42,821 --> 01:15:45,192
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

1016
01:15:45,365 --> 01:15:46,906
We got trouble, guys.

1017
01:15:49,828 --> 01:15:50,906
Lock and load!

1018
01:16:02,131 --> 01:16:03,505
The hell was that?

1019
01:16:25,363 --> 01:16:28,031
-These are built for that, right?
-He'll need something...

1020
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:29,989
...a lot bigger to get through this.

1021
01:16:31,035 --> 01:16:32,492
What is that?

1022
01:16:33,829 --> 01:16:35,156
What is that, a bazooka?

1023
01:16:43,797 --> 01:16:45,503
I didn't sign up for this!

1024
01:17:01,857 --> 01:17:03,184
Look out.

1025
01:17:03,984 --> 01:17:05,145
Look out!

1026
01:17:13,452 --> 01:17:14,482
Hmm.

1027
01:17:27,424 --> 01:17:28,537
Come on, let's go!

1028
01:18:15,268 --> 01:18:17,474
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

1029
01:18:17,645 --> 01:18:20,480
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

1030
01:18:25,403 --> 01:18:28,985
Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

1031
01:18:36,455 --> 01:18:38,577
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!

1032
01:18:44,088 --> 01:18:45,961
I like this job. I like it.

1033
01:18:48,217 --> 01:18:50,838
Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

1034
01:19:04,816 --> 01:19:06,310
Goodbye.

1035
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:18,613
We're on point, ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

1036
01:19:25,003 --> 01:19:27,458
That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.

1037
01:19:41,019 --> 01:19:42,726
Okay, rack them up.

1038
01:19:42,896 --> 01:19:45,268
Rack them up, rack them up,
rack them up.

1039
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,169
That's not good.

1040
01:20:15,678 --> 01:20:16,876
Okay, that's not good!

1041
01:21:00,013 --> 01:21:02,089
Now, there's a Batman.

1042
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:07,593
Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.

1043
01:21:10,524 --> 01:21:11,638
Come on.

1044
01:21:20,784 --> 01:21:22,028
He missed!

1045
01:21:35,965 --> 01:21:38,372
You can't stop here.
We're like sitting ducks!

1046
01:21:55,401 --> 01:21:56,480
Come on, come on.

1047
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:02,982
Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on!

1048
01:22:05,536 --> 01:22:06,994
Come on.

1049
01:22:07,663 --> 01:22:10,996
Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.

1050
01:22:11,167 --> 01:22:12,791
Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!

1051
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:15,951
Hit me!

1052
01:22:40,946 --> 01:22:44,196
Come on, come on. Aah!

1053
01:22:44,366 --> 01:22:46,607
Could you please just give me a minute?

1054
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:50,530
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1055
01:22:53,834 --> 01:22:57,748
Gor... You do like to play things
pretty close to the chest.

1056
01:22:58,213 --> 01:22:59,920
We got him, Harvey.

1057
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:03,541
Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1058
01:23:03,718 --> 01:23:07,003
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1059
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:08,508
But you and your office...

1060
01:23:08,682 --> 01:23:10,341
...have been working
with the Batman all along.

1061
01:23:10,517 --> 01:23:12,308
No, but I trusted him
to do the right thing.

1062
01:23:12,477 --> 01:23:14,553
Which was?
-Saving my ass.

1063
01:23:14,729 --> 01:23:17,646
All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.

1064
01:23:17,816 --> 01:23:19,725
Thank you, detective.

1065
01:23:19,943 --> 01:23:22,065
I've got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.

1066
01:23:22,237 --> 01:23:24,609
-I figured, counselor.
Mr. Dent, sir...

1067
01:23:24,781 --> 01:23:28,909
...how about one for the front page, sir?
Mr. Dent.

1068
01:23:40,254 --> 01:23:43,420
Stand away! All of you!

1069
01:23:43,591 --> 01:23:47,090
I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer
to use, you understand?

1070
01:23:49,347 --> 01:23:51,220
Back from the dead.

1071
01:23:51,891 --> 01:23:53,433
I, uh...

1072
01:23:53,601 --> 01:23:55,510
...couldn't risk my family's safety.

1073
01:23:56,812 --> 01:23:58,638
What do we got?

1074
01:24:00,316 --> 01:24:04,265
Nothing. No matches on prints,
DNA, dental.

1075
01:24:04,445 --> 01:24:07,196
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1076
01:24:07,406 --> 01:24:09,528
Nothing in his pockets
but knives and lint.

1077
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:11,609
No name.

1078
01:24:11,952 --> 01:24:13,909
-No other alias.
Go home, Gordon.

1079
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:17,163
The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.

1080
01:24:17,333 --> 01:24:19,159
You're gonna need it.

1081
01:24:19,418 --> 01:24:21,991
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1082
01:24:22,671 --> 01:24:25,837
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

1083
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:43,812
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.

1084
01:24:50,323 --> 01:24:51,733
Look at these ugly bastards.

1085
01:24:51,908 --> 01:24:53,781
-I don't feel good.
You're a cop killer.

1086
01:24:53,952 --> 01:24:56,277
You're lucky to be feeling anything
below the neck.

1087
01:24:56,454 --> 01:24:58,031
-Please!
-Step away from the bars!

1088
01:24:58,206 --> 01:25:00,364
My insides hurt.

1089
01:25:14,556 --> 01:25:16,347
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

1090
01:25:18,518 --> 01:25:20,806
Actually, this time...

1091
01:25:20,979 --> 01:25:23,137
...I saved him.

1092
01:25:34,492 --> 01:25:36,116
Has he said anything yet?

1093
01:25:43,709 --> 01:25:47,920
Evening, commissioner.

1094
01:25:55,554 --> 01:25:57,760
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1095
01:25:57,932 --> 01:26:00,054
-Of course not.
-What have you done with him?

1096
01:26:00,976 --> 01:26:02,719
Me?

1097
01:26:04,355 --> 01:26:06,477
I was right here.

1098
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:09,726
Who did you leave him with?

1099
01:26:09,902 --> 01:26:12,737
Hm? Your people?

1100
01:26:13,864 --> 01:26:17,197
Assuming, of course,
that they are still your people...

1101
01:26:17,367 --> 01:26:20,071
...and not Maroni's.

1102
01:26:22,289 --> 01:26:24,661
Does it depress you, commissioner...

1103
01:26:25,083 --> 01:26:30,041
...to know just how alone you really are?

1104
01:26:32,049 --> 01:26:36,924
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1105
01:26:37,095 --> 01:26:39,764
-Where is he?
-What's the time?

1106
01:26:40,265 --> 01:26:41,759
What difference does that make?

1107
01:26:42,017 --> 01:26:47,473
Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or several.

1108
01:26:53,862 --> 01:26:56,815
-lf we're gonna play games...
-Mm-hm?

1109
01:26:59,993 --> 01:27:01,950
...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1110
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:06,200
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1111
01:27:06,874 --> 01:27:07,905
Not exactly.

1112
01:27:18,428 --> 01:27:22,472
Never start with the head. The victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next...

1113
01:27:25,643 --> 01:27:26,757
See?

1114
01:27:26,936 --> 01:27:29,261
You wanted me. Here I am.

1115
01:27:30,314 --> 01:27:32,436
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1116
01:27:32,984 --> 01:27:35,557
And you didn't disappoint.

1117
01:27:35,736 --> 01:27:38,571
You let five people die.

1118
01:27:39,532 --> 01:27:43,197
Then you let Dent take your place.

1119
01:27:43,369 --> 01:27:45,990
-Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
-Where's Dent?

1120
01:27:46,163 --> 01:27:50,955
Those Mob fools want you gone so they
can get back to the way things were.

1121
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:56,205
But I know the truth. There's no
going back. You've changed things.

1122
01:27:56,382 --> 01:27:58,789
-Forever.
-Then why do you wanna kill me?

1123
01:28:01,762 --> 01:28:03,172
I don't wanna kill you.

1124
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:08,223
What would I do without you? Go back
to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.

1125
01:28:08,393 --> 01:28:10,765
No. No, you...

1126
01:28:10,938 --> 01:28:13,345
You complete me.

1127
01:28:13,523 --> 01:28:17,852
-You're garbage who kills for money.
-Don't talk like one of them. You're not.

1128
01:28:18,028 --> 01:28:20,435
Even if you'd like to be.

1129
01:28:21,698 --> 01:28:23,524
To them, you're just a freak...

1130
01:28:24,451 --> 01:28:25,779
...like me.

1131
01:28:25,952 --> 01:28:28,240
They need you right now...

1132
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:30,869
...but when they don't...

1133
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:34,452
...they'll cast you out like a leper.

1134
01:28:34,628 --> 01:28:38,542
You see, their morals, their code...

1135
01:28:38,798 --> 01:28:40,956
...it's a bad joke.

1136
01:28:41,217 --> 01:28:44,550
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1137
01:28:45,221 --> 01:28:49,218
They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1138
01:28:49,392 --> 01:28:52,558
When the chips are down, these...

1139
01:28:52,729 --> 01:28:54,970
These civilized people...

1140
01:28:55,148 --> 01:28:57,224
...they'll eat each other.

1141
01:28:57,942 --> 01:29:00,314
See, I'm not a monster.

1142
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,976
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1143
01:29:05,241 --> 01:29:06,320
Where's Dent?

1144
01:29:06,492 --> 01:29:09,409
You have all these rules,
and you think they'll save you.

1145
01:29:12,498 --> 01:29:14,905
-He's in control.
-I have one rule.

1146
01:29:15,084 --> 01:29:18,168
Oh. Then that's the rule you'll have
to break to know the truth.

1147
01:29:18,337 --> 01:29:19,499
Which is?

1148
01:29:19,672 --> 01:29:22,079
The only sensible way to live
is without rules.

1149
01:29:22,258 --> 01:29:24,927
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.

1150
01:29:25,094 --> 01:29:26,125
I'm considering it.

1151
01:29:26,303 --> 01:29:28,924
There's only minutes left,
so you'll have to play my game...

1152
01:29:29,098 --> 01:29:31,671
...if you wanna save one of them.

1153
01:29:32,184 --> 01:29:33,215
"Them"?

1154
01:29:33,394 --> 01:29:37,438
You know, for a while there,
I thought you really were Dent.

1155
01:29:37,606 --> 01:29:40,227
The way you threw yourself after her.

1156
01:29:46,532 --> 01:29:47,611
Look at you go.

1157
01:29:53,247 --> 01:29:56,829
Does Harvey know
about you and his little bunny?

1158
01:29:57,751 --> 01:29:59,126
Where are they?!

1159
01:29:59,294 --> 01:30:01,286
Killing is making a choice.

1160
01:30:01,463 --> 01:30:04,547
-Where are they?!
-Choose between one life or the other.

1161
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:09,546
Your friend the district attorney,
or his blushing bride-to-be.

1162
01:30:14,726 --> 01:30:18,806
You have nothing,
nothing to threaten me with.

1163
01:30:19,231 --> 01:30:22,730
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1164
01:30:22,943 --> 01:30:26,358
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you
where they are, both of them.

1165
01:30:26,529 --> 01:30:29,565
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1166
01:30:30,325 --> 01:30:33,160
He's at 25052nd Street...

1167
01:30:33,328 --> 01:30:36,661
...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.

1168
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:40,493
-Which one you going after?
-Rachel.

1169
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:43,330
We're getting Dent!

1170
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:48,425
25052nd Street!

1171
01:30:51,346 --> 01:30:53,172
Hello?

1172
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:56,512
Can anybody hear me?

1173
01:30:58,936 --> 01:31:01,557
Hello!

1174
01:31:05,568 --> 01:31:07,809
-Rachel?
-Harvey.

1175
01:31:07,987 --> 01:31:10,193
Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?

1176
01:31:10,364 --> 01:31:11,941
I'm all right. I'm in a...

1177
01:31:12,116 --> 01:31:15,698
I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.

1178
01:31:16,746 --> 01:31:17,944
I am too.

1179
01:31:18,497 --> 01:31:20,204
Harvey.

1180
01:31:27,464 --> 01:31:29,919
I want my phone call.

1181
01:31:30,092 --> 01:31:32,879
I want it. I want it.
I want my phone call.

1182
01:31:33,554 --> 01:31:35,380
That's nice.

1183
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:41,717
How many of your friends have I killed?

1184
01:31:45,482 --> 01:31:46,561
I'm a 20-year man...

1185
01:31:46,733 --> 01:31:50,184
...and I know the difference between
punks who need a lesson in manners...

1186
01:31:50,362 --> 01:31:53,232
...and the freaks like you
who would just enjoy it.

1187
01:31:54,116 --> 01:31:56,571
And you killed six of my friends.

1188
01:31:56,743 --> 01:31:57,774
Six?

1189
01:31:57,953 --> 01:32:00,408
Please. My insides hurt.

1190
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:02,323
I don't really care. Back away.

1191
01:32:02,499 --> 01:32:05,665
The boss said he'd make the voices
go away.

1192
01:32:05,836 --> 01:32:09,370
He said he'd go inside
and replace them with bright lights...

1193
01:32:09,548 --> 01:32:10,662
...like Christmas.

1194
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:13,377
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.

1195
01:32:13,551 --> 01:32:16,386
Medic to the holding tank.
Come on. Get the door open.

1196
01:32:16,596 --> 01:32:17,758
You guys, back off!

1197
01:32:17,931 --> 01:32:20,089
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.

1198
01:32:20,266 --> 01:32:24,263
They told me that only one of us
was gonna make it...

1199
01:32:24,437 --> 01:32:27,770
...and that they were gonna
let our friends choose.

1200
01:32:30,485 --> 01:32:32,607
Okay, Rachel.

1201
01:32:33,196 --> 01:32:36,315
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right.
They're coming for you.

1202
01:32:36,491 --> 01:32:40,784
Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me
through what's going on with you.

1203
01:32:40,953 --> 01:32:42,862
Can you find something,
anything, sharp?

1204
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:44,449
I'm trying.

1205
01:32:44,624 --> 01:32:46,782
-What's...?
-Shit.

1206
01:32:46,959 --> 01:32:48,453
Harvey?

1207
01:32:52,215 --> 01:32:53,874
Harvey, what's happening?

1208
01:33:03,225 --> 01:33:07,056
All available units,
converge at 25052nd Street.

1209
01:33:07,396 --> 01:33:11,476
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?

1210
01:33:13,777 --> 01:33:15,105
Guns are too quick.

1211
01:33:15,279 --> 01:33:18,647
You can't savor all the...

1212
01:33:18,824 --> 01:33:22,157
...little emotions.

1213
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:28,954
You see, in their last moments...

1214
01:33:29,126 --> 01:33:31,414
...people show you who they really are.

1215
01:33:32,504 --> 01:33:38,174
So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.

1216
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:45,345
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1217
01:33:51,857 --> 01:33:53,516
What's that?
Jeez.

1218
01:33:53,733 --> 01:33:55,772
He's got some kind of a...

1219
01:33:55,944 --> 01:33:59,147
...contusion.
-I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1220
01:34:00,532 --> 01:34:04,280
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it
even more.

1221
01:34:09,499 --> 01:34:10,779
Whoa, whoa!

1222
01:34:11,835 --> 01:34:12,866
Just put it down.

1223
01:34:13,044 --> 01:34:15,831
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!

1224
01:34:16,005 --> 01:34:19,954
-It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!
-Let him go now! Drop it!

1225
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:23,260
-What? Sorry?
-What do you want?

1226
01:34:24,305 --> 01:34:26,214
I just want my phone call.

1227
01:34:29,227 --> 01:34:31,896
What...? What...? What's happening?

1228
01:34:32,063 --> 01:34:34,898
Just talk to me, just for one second.

1229
01:34:37,235 --> 01:34:39,904
-All right?
-Right.

1230
01:34:41,822 --> 01:34:43,232
Ow.

1231
01:34:44,158 --> 01:34:45,735
-Ow.
-Shh, shh, shh.

1232
01:34:51,707 --> 01:34:53,746
Is that a phone?

1233
01:35:03,427 --> 01:35:04,755
Mount the curb!

1234
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:16,767
Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?

1235
01:35:16,940 --> 01:35:18,731
Don 't think like that. They're coming.

1236
01:35:18,901 --> 01:35:21,189
I know they are,
but I don't want them to.

1237
01:35:25,616 --> 01:35:29,696
I don't wanna live without you,
and I do have an answer for you.

1238
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:31,863
My answer is yes.

1239
01:35:34,624 --> 01:35:37,375
No! No! No!

1240
01:35:37,544 --> 01:35:40,165
Not me! Why are you coming for me?

1241
01:35:40,338 --> 01:35:41,369
No!

1242
01:35:43,049 --> 01:35:44,626
Rachel! Rachel!

1243
01:35:44,843 --> 01:35:47,168
-Harvey.
-No! No! Rachel!

1244
01:35:47,345 --> 01:35:48,376
Okay.

1245
01:35:48,555 --> 01:35:49,634
Rachel!

1246
01:35:50,056 --> 01:35:51,598
No! No!

1247
01:35:51,766 --> 01:35:55,894
Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen.

1248
01:35:56,062 --> 01:35:57,390
Somewh...

1249
01:36:03,278 --> 01:36:04,476
No, commissioner!

1250
01:36:04,654 --> 01:36:07,323
Rachel! No!

1251
01:36:21,671 --> 01:36:22,785
Hello there.

1252
01:36:28,678 --> 01:36:32,177
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.

1253
01:36:33,099 --> 01:36:34,806
With Lau?

1254
01:36:37,603 --> 01:36:40,176
The Joker planned to be caught.

1255
01:36:40,523 --> 01:36:42,681
He wanted me to lock him up
in the MCU.

1256
01:37:02,336 --> 01:37:04,375
Dear Bruce:

1257
01:37:06,131 --> 01:37:08,668
I need to be honest and clear.

1258
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:13,256
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.

1259
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:17,344
I love him, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.

1260
01:37:17,893 --> 01:37:22,305
When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman, we could be together...

1261
01:37:22,481 --> 01:37:24,687
... I meant it.

1262
01:37:24,941 --> 01:37:29,686
But now I'm sure the day won 't come
when you no longer need Batman.

1263
01:37:30,739 --> 01:37:32,648
I hope it does.

1264
01:37:32,824 --> 01:37:35,575
And if it does, I will be there...

1265
01:37:36,119 --> 01:37:37,529
... but as your friend.

1266
01:37:38,246 --> 01:37:40,487
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1267
01:37:40,665 --> 01:37:43,037
I'm sorry to let you down.

1268
01:37:43,209 --> 01:37:48,203
If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.

1269
01:37:48,798 --> 01:37:53,210
Love, now and always, Rachel.

1270
01:38:01,185 --> 01:38:03,510
Prepared a little breakfast.

1271
01:38:07,650 --> 01:38:09,559
-Very well, then.
-Alfred.

1272
01:38:09,736 --> 01:38:10,898
Yes, Master Wayne?

1273
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:14,521
Did I bring this on her?

1274
01:38:15,575 --> 01:38:17,781
I was meant to inspire good...

1275
01:38:17,952 --> 01:38:20,324
...not madness, not death.

1276
01:38:20,496 --> 01:38:25,122
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1277
01:38:25,292 --> 01:38:27,368
Didn't you think
there might be casualties?

1278
01:38:27,545 --> 01:38:29,952
Things always get worse
before they get better.

1279
01:38:30,297 --> 01:38:31,755
But Rachel, Alfred.

1280
01:38:31,924 --> 01:38:35,707
Rachel believed in what you stood for...

1281
01:38:35,886 --> 01:38:37,795
...what we stand for.

1282
01:38:37,972 --> 01:38:39,430
Gotham needs you.

1283
01:38:39,974 --> 01:38:42,927
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1284
01:38:43,435 --> 01:38:47,563
...and I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.

1285
01:38:47,731 --> 01:38:50,056
Which is why, for now...

1286
01:38:50,859 --> 01:38:52,768
...they're gonna have to
make do with you.

1287
01:38:54,988 --> 01:38:56,814
She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.

1288
01:38:58,826 --> 01:39:00,865
Dent doesn't know.

1289
01:39:01,036 --> 01:39:02,316
He can never know.

1290
01:39:04,748 --> 01:39:06,372
What's that?

1291
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:09,494
-It can wait.
-That bandit...

1292
01:39:09,961 --> 01:39:12,083
...in the forest in Burma.

1293
01:39:12,255 --> 01:39:14,294
-Did you catch him?
-Yes.

1294
01:39:14,466 --> 01:39:15,794
How?

1295
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:18,843
We burned the forest down.

1296
01:39:58,092 --> 01:40:00,713
He's credible, an M & A lawyer
from a leading consultancy.

1297
01:40:00,887 --> 01:40:04,255
He says he's waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing.

1298
01:40:04,432 --> 01:40:06,508
Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.

1299
01:40:06,684 --> 01:40:09,637
We'll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.

1300
01:40:26,078 --> 01:40:27,702
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1301
01:40:30,416 --> 01:40:35,243
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.

1302
01:40:36,296 --> 01:40:38,253
That you're refusing to...

1303
01:40:38,424 --> 01:40:40,167
...accept skin grafts.

1304
01:40:40,509 --> 01:40:42,750
Remember that name...

1305
01:40:43,345 --> 01:40:45,670
...you all had for me...

1306
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:48,975
...when I was at Internal Affairs?

1307
01:40:51,436 --> 01:40:52,716
What was it, Gordon?

1308
01:40:53,397 --> 01:40:54,772
Harvey, I...

1309
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:56,434
Say it.

1310
01:40:57,859 --> 01:40:59,768
Say it!

1311
01:41:07,452 --> 01:41:10,536
Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.

1312
01:41:12,123 --> 01:41:16,416
Why should I hide who I am?

1313
01:41:17,629 --> 01:41:18,957
I know you tried to warn me.

1314
01:41:19,839 --> 01:41:21,037
I'm sorry.

1315
01:41:21,674 --> 01:41:24,295
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1316
01:41:26,596 --> 01:41:28,968
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1317
01:41:29,808 --> 01:41:32,808
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1318
01:41:33,186 --> 01:41:35,308
Why would you listen to me now?

1319
01:41:36,439 --> 01:41:38,098
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1320
01:41:40,652 --> 01:41:42,443
No.

1321
01:41:42,904 --> 01:41:45,026
No, you're not.

1322
01:41:46,074 --> 01:41:47,318
Not yet.

1323
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:55,284
This craziness, it's too much.

1324
01:41:55,499 --> 01:41:58,749
Should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1325
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:00,663
MARONl:
You want him?

1326
01:42:03,132 --> 01:42:05,457
I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.

1327
01:42:13,517 --> 01:42:15,805
Not so crazy as you look.

1328
01:42:15,978 --> 01:42:19,726
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1329
01:42:22,943 --> 01:42:24,187
Where is the Italian?

1330
01:42:24,361 --> 01:42:27,480
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1331
01:42:27,656 --> 01:42:31,107
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1332
01:42:31,702 --> 01:42:32,864
Please.

1333
01:42:33,036 --> 01:42:36,369
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1334
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:39,709
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1335
01:42:39,876 --> 01:42:41,535
I enjoy...

1336
01:42:41,712 --> 01:42:43,087
...dynamite...

1337
01:42:43,255 --> 01:42:44,797
...and gunpowder...

1338
01:42:45,257 --> 01:42:47,664
...and gasoline.

1339
01:42:49,136 --> 01:42:51,377
-What the...?
-Ah, ah, ah.

1340
01:42:53,223 --> 01:42:56,058
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1341
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:57,840
They're cheap.

1342
01:42:58,019 --> 01:43:00,688
How much are they
paying you to say who Batman is?

1343
01:43:00,855 --> 01:43:04,804
This is our chance. I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.

1344
01:43:04,985 --> 01:43:06,395
Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.

1345
01:43:06,569 --> 01:43:07,897
Let's take the next caller.

1346
01:43:08,071 --> 01:43:10,229
Harvey Dent didn 't wanna
give in to this maniac.

1347
01:43:10,407 --> 01:43:11,687
You think you know better?

1348
01:43:11,866 --> 01:43:15,234
I think that if we could talk to Dent
today, he may feel differently.

1349
01:43:15,411 --> 01:43:19,491
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because God knows, we need him now.

1350
01:43:19,666 --> 01:43:21,872
You said you were a man of your word.

1351
01:43:22,168 --> 01:43:24,207
Oh, I am.

1352
01:43:25,922 --> 01:43:28,591
I'm only burning my half.

1353
01:43:29,926 --> 01:43:32,048
All you care about is money.

1354
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:35,671
This town deserves
a better class of criminal...

1355
01:43:35,848 --> 01:43:38,089
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1356
01:43:38,893 --> 01:43:41,383
Tell your men they work for me now.

1357
01:43:41,562 --> 01:43:43,934
This is my city.

1358
01:43:44,607 --> 01:43:47,144
They won't work for a freak.

1359
01:43:47,318 --> 01:43:49,025
"Freak."

1360
01:43:49,195 --> 01:43:51,650
Why don't we
cut you up into little pieces...

1361
01:43:51,822 --> 01:43:53,280
...and feed you to your pooches? Hm?

1362
01:43:53,449 --> 01:43:56,319
And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.

1363
01:43:58,329 --> 01:44:00,654
It's not about money...

1364
01:44:00,831 --> 01:44:04,034
...it's about sending a message.

1365
01:44:04,835 --> 01:44:07,290
Everything burns.

1366
01:44:09,798 --> 01:44:11,956
-Who is this?
I had a vision...

1367
01:44:12,134 --> 01:44:14,885
... of a world without Batman.

1368
01:44:15,054 --> 01:44:17,295
The Mob ground out a little profit...

1369
01:44:17,473 --> 01:44:21,387
... and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.

1370
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:24,845
And it was so boring.

1371
01:44:25,022 --> 01:44:26,979
I've had a change of heart.

1372
01:44:27,149 --> 01:44:29,770
I don 't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...

1373
01:44:29,943 --> 01:44:34,651
... but why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.

1374
01:44:34,823 --> 01:44:39,650
If Coleman Reese
isn 't dead in 60 minutes...

1375
01:44:39,828 --> 01:44:41,904
... then I blow up a hospital.

1376
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:43,657
Call in every officer.

1377
01:44:43,832 --> 01:44:47,165
Tell them to head to their nearest
hospital and start evac and search.

1378
01:44:47,335 --> 01:44:49,457
Call the transit authority,
school board, prisons.

1379
01:44:49,629 --> 01:44:51,253
Get every bus down to a hospital.

1380
01:44:51,423 --> 01:44:56,001
The priority is Gotham General. Wheel
everybody out of that place right now.

1381
01:44:56,177 --> 01:44:57,836
You, you and you, you come with me.

1382
01:44:58,013 --> 01:44:59,886
-Where are we going, sir?
-To get Reese.

1383
01:45:00,223 --> 01:45:03,307
I need you plugged in, checking
Gordon's men and their families.

1384
01:45:03,476 --> 01:45:05,682
-Looking for?
-Hospital admissions.

1385
01:45:05,854 --> 01:45:07,513
Will you be wanting the Batpod?

1386
01:45:07,689 --> 01:45:09,646
In the middle of the day?
Not very subtle.

1387
01:45:09,816 --> 01:45:11,096
The Lamborghini, then.

1388
01:45:12,026 --> 01:45:13,140
Much more subtle.

1389
01:45:26,999 --> 01:45:29,489
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1390
01:45:29,669 --> 01:45:33,168
Sir, could you help, please?

1391
01:45:33,339 --> 01:45:35,046
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1392
01:45:37,009 --> 01:45:38,882
Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...

1393
01:45:39,053 --> 01:45:41,211
...an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man?

1394
01:45:45,726 --> 01:45:48,051
Sir. Commissioner.

1395
01:45:50,147 --> 01:45:52,353
Get the cars around the back!

1396
01:45:54,735 --> 01:45:56,063
Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1397
01:46:02,034 --> 01:46:03,991
I see O'Brien and Richards.

1398
01:46:04,578 --> 01:46:08,077
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1399
01:46:09,374 --> 01:46:12,908
They're trying to kill me.
-Well, maybe Batman can save you.

1400
01:46:26,058 --> 01:46:28,679
Davis, they got space. Bring him out.

1401
01:46:30,353 --> 01:46:32,144
Davis.

1402
01:46:37,277 --> 01:46:39,602
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1403
01:46:39,779 --> 01:46:40,977
Nothing on them.

1404
01:46:41,156 --> 01:46:42,614
And a patrolman I don't know.

1405
01:46:43,825 --> 01:46:45,734
Okay, so, what now?

1406
01:46:46,619 --> 01:46:48,860
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1407
01:46:51,624 --> 01:46:53,283
Send the information to Gordon.

1408
01:47:01,175 --> 01:47:02,717
Get out of here.

1409
01:47:04,762 --> 01:47:06,553
Davis.

1410
01:47:09,726 --> 01:47:12,133
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
move him now.

1411
01:47:23,823 --> 01:47:26,148
It's Berg, isn't it?
-Commissioner.

1412
01:47:27,284 --> 01:47:28,742
You okay, son?

1413
01:47:46,762 --> 01:47:48,339
Hi.

1414
01:47:53,185 --> 01:47:54,679
You know...

1415
01:47:55,521 --> 01:47:58,605
...I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1416
01:47:58,774 --> 01:48:01,893
-When you and...
-Rachel!

1417
01:48:02,069 --> 01:48:04,357
-Rachel were being abducted...

1418
01:48:04,530 --> 01:48:07,530
...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1419
01:48:07,866 --> 01:48:09,775
I didn't rig those charges.

1420
01:48:09,993 --> 01:48:12,448
Your men, your plan.

1421
01:48:12,663 --> 01:48:15,118
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1422
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:18,327
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1423
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:21,415
I wouldn't know what to do with one
if I caught it.

1424
01:48:21,588 --> 01:48:24,707
You know? I just do things.

1425
01:48:25,091 --> 01:48:28,791
The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.

1426
01:48:28,970 --> 01:48:31,176
Gordon's got plans.

1427
01:48:31,348 --> 01:48:34,301
You know, they're schemers.

1428
01:48:34,476 --> 01:48:38,224
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1429
01:48:38,396 --> 01:48:39,890
I'm not a schemer.

1430
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:41,688
I try to show the schemers...

1431
01:48:41,858 --> 01:48:47,148
...how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1432
01:48:48,114 --> 01:48:51,150
So when I say... Ah. Come here.

1433
01:48:51,659 --> 01:48:55,193
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...

1434
01:48:56,748 --> 01:48:58,954
...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

1435
01:49:01,461 --> 01:49:04,248
-I'm gonna need your weapon.
-What?

1436
01:49:08,009 --> 01:49:09,835
Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

1437
01:49:10,553 --> 01:49:12,095
Yeah, that'd be why.

1438
01:49:13,014 --> 01:49:16,217
It's the schemers
that put you where you are.

1439
01:49:16,392 --> 01:49:20,175
You were a schemer, you had plans...

1440
01:49:20,354 --> 01:49:22,512
...and look where that got you.

1441
01:49:33,284 --> 01:49:35,656
Police are taking every precaution...

1442
01:49:35,828 --> 01:49:37,950
... urging people not to
take matters into their hands.

1443
01:49:38,122 --> 01:49:40,659
I just did what I do best.

1444
01:49:40,833 --> 01:49:44,451
I took your little plan
and I turned it on itself.

1445
01:49:44,628 --> 01:49:49,966
Look what I did to this city with a few
drums of gas and a couple of bullets.

1446
01:49:50,133 --> 01:49:53,418
Hm? You know what I noticed?

1447
01:49:53,595 --> 01:49:57,129
Nobody panics when
things go "according to plan."

1448
01:49:57,307 --> 01:49:58,966
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1449
01:49:59,601 --> 01:50:04,642
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,
a gangbanger will get shot...

1450
01:50:04,815 --> 01:50:08,266
...or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up...

1451
01:50:08,568 --> 01:50:09,647
...nobody panics.

1452
01:50:10,362 --> 01:50:13,446
Because it's all part of the plan.

1453
01:50:13,615 --> 01:50:18,526
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...

1454
01:50:18,787 --> 01:50:21,194
...well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1455
01:50:24,626 --> 01:50:27,543
Introduce a little anarchy...

1456
01:50:28,713 --> 01:50:30,954
...upset the established order...

1457
01:50:31,132 --> 01:50:35,675
...and everything becomes chaos.

1458
01:50:37,513 --> 01:50:40,264
I'm an agent of chaos.

1459
01:50:40,642 --> 01:50:42,967
Oh, and you know the thing
about chaos?

1460
01:50:45,021 --> 01:50:46,645
It's fair.

1461
01:50:55,865 --> 01:50:59,031
-You live.
-Mm-hm.

1462
01:50:59,535 --> 01:51:01,159
You die.

1463
01:51:01,370 --> 01:51:03,362
Mmm. Now we're talking.

1464
01:51:12,715 --> 01:51:14,209
Mr. Reese.

1465
01:51:32,401 --> 01:51:34,559
That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1466
01:51:34,736 --> 01:51:37,736
-That was a very brave thing you did.
-Trying to catch the light?

1467
01:51:38,073 --> 01:51:40,908
-You weren't protecting the van?
-Why? Who's in it?

1468
01:51:46,373 --> 01:51:48,449
Don't you think
I should go to the hospital?

1469
01:51:48,625 --> 01:51:51,115
Don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1470
01:52:57,276 --> 01:52:59,102
Southeast.

1471
01:52:59,278 --> 01:53:01,484
It's Gotham General.

1472
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:03,898
-Did you clear the building?
Yeah.

1473
01:53:06,911 --> 01:53:08,618
You must know
how many were inside.

1474
01:53:08,787 --> 01:53:10,162
You have patient lists, roll call.

1475
01:53:10,331 --> 01:53:12,656
Right now we're showing
50 people missing. One bus.

1476
01:53:12,833 --> 01:53:15,999
The other buses were heading off to
hospitals. I guess we missed one.

1477
01:53:16,170 --> 01:53:18,292
What's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1478
01:53:18,464 --> 01:53:22,924
Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.
Anybody asks, we got him out.

1479
01:53:25,512 --> 01:53:27,919
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1480
01:53:29,099 --> 01:53:30,842
We're gonna need the National Guard.

1481
01:53:31,018 --> 01:53:32,642
-people are still missing...

1482
01:53:32,811 --> 01:53:34,009
... including GCN's own Mike Engel.

1483
01:53:34,187 --> 01:53:37,437
I'm now being told that we're cutting to
a video GCN has just received.

1484
01:53:37,607 --> 01:53:39,516
I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.

1485
01:53:40,027 --> 01:53:43,360
"What does it take
to make you people wanna join in?

1486
01:53:43,530 --> 01:53:46,103
You failed to kill the lawyer.
I've gotta get you off the bench...

1487
01:53:46,283 --> 01:53:48,026
...and into the game.
Bench. Game.

1488
01:53:50,203 --> 01:53:52,325
Come nightfall, this city is mine.
Mine.

1489
01:53:52,497 --> 01:53:55,248
-And anyone left here plays by my rules.
-Rules.

1490
01:53:55,542 --> 01:53:58,875
Mr. Fox? Security is showing
a break-in at the R & D Department.

1491
01:53:59,045 --> 01:54:01,167
If you don 't wanna be in the game...

1492
01:54:01,339 --> 01:54:02,714
...get out now.
-Get out now.

1493
01:54:04,884 --> 01:54:07,837
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise.

1494
01:54:08,221 --> 01:54:09,928
Ha-ha, ha-ha. "

1495
01:54:43,589 --> 01:54:44,869
Gotham P.D.
has shut down...

1496
01:54:45,049 --> 01:54:47,504
Sweet Jesus.
...the area 's bridges and tunnels.

1497
01:54:47,676 --> 01:54:51,091
Shouldn't you be out there,
you know, doing something?

1498
01:54:51,263 --> 01:54:53,220
It's my day off.

1499
01:54:53,849 --> 01:54:55,426
I gotta take a leak.

1500
01:54:55,601 --> 01:54:57,926
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1501
01:55:03,525 --> 01:55:05,482
Now what?
Need someone to shake it for you?

1502
01:55:05,653 --> 01:55:07,230
Hello.

1503
01:55:07,946 --> 01:55:09,440
Dent.

1504
01:55:09,615 --> 01:55:11,821
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1505
01:55:11,992 --> 01:55:13,651
Half.

1506
01:55:19,708 --> 01:55:21,285
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1507
01:55:21,460 --> 01:55:23,452
-It must've been Maroni's men.
-Shut up!

1508
01:55:25,213 --> 01:55:27,335
Are you telling me
that you're gonna protect...

1509
01:55:27,507 --> 01:55:29,250
...the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1510
01:55:29,426 --> 01:55:30,884
I don't know, he never told me.

1511
01:55:31,053 --> 01:55:34,671
Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't
know what they were gonna do to you.

1512
01:55:36,224 --> 01:55:37,386
That's funny...

1513
01:55:39,144 --> 01:55:41,895
...because I don't know
what's gonna happen to you either.

1514
01:55:46,026 --> 01:55:47,935
Beautiful, isn't it?

1515
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:49,979
Beautiful.

1516
01:55:50,530 --> 01:55:51,644
Unethical.

1517
01:55:52,824 --> 01:55:54,366
Dangerous.

1518
01:55:54,576 --> 01:55:58,075
You've turned every cell phone
in Gotham into a microphone.

1519
01:55:58,246 --> 01:56:00,653
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1520
01:56:00,832 --> 01:56:05,908
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.

1521
01:56:06,087 --> 01:56:10,665
With half the city feeding you sonar,
you can image all of Gotham.

1522
01:56:12,593 --> 01:56:13,968
This is wrong.

1523
01:56:14,137 --> 01:56:16,176
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1524
01:56:18,182 --> 01:56:19,462
At what cost?

1525
01:56:19,642 --> 01:56:22,429
The database is null-key encrypted.

1526
01:56:22,603 --> 01:56:24,809
It can only be accessed by one person.

1527
01:56:26,148 --> 01:56:28,306
This is too much power for one person.

1528
01:56:28,484 --> 01:56:30,642
That's why I gave it to you.

1529
01:56:31,112 --> 01:56:32,310
Only you can use it.

1530
01:56:32,488 --> 01:56:36,271
Spying on 30 million people
isn't part of my job description.

1531
01:56:38,494 --> 01:56:42,194
This is an audio sample. If he talks
within range of any phone in the city...

1532
01:56:42,373 --> 01:56:44,579
...you can triangulate his position.

1533
01:56:45,042 --> 01:56:47,532
I'll help you this one time.

1534
01:56:48,003 --> 01:56:49,794
But consider this my resignation.

1535
01:56:49,964 --> 01:56:54,542
As long as this machine is
at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1536
01:56:55,302 --> 01:56:57,211
When you're finished...

1537
01:56:57,888 --> 01:56:59,002
...type in your name.

1538
01:57:07,606 --> 01:57:10,690
My officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges...

1539
01:57:10,859 --> 01:57:14,062
...but with the Joker's threat,
they're not an option.

1540
01:57:14,237 --> 01:57:17,072
-And land routes east?
-Backed up for hours.

1541
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:20,858
Which leaves the ferries
with 30,000 ready to board.

1542
01:57:21,036 --> 01:57:24,072
I wanna use the ferries so I can
get those prisoners off the island.

1543
01:57:24,414 --> 01:57:27,201
The men you put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1544
01:57:27,375 --> 01:57:29,497
You should be.
Whatever the Joker's planning...

1545
01:57:29,669 --> 01:57:34,165
...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are
involved. I wanna get them out of here.

1546
01:57:35,634 --> 01:57:36,832
So where is Harvey?

1547
01:57:37,427 --> 01:57:40,593
-We haven't found him.
-Oh, Jesus.

1548
01:57:44,434 --> 01:57:46,510
How long can you keep this quiet?

1549
01:58:00,616 --> 01:58:03,285
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

1550
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:06,278
Going to join your wife?

1551
01:58:09,792 --> 01:58:12,282
-You love her?
-Yes.

1552
01:58:13,170 --> 01:58:16,123
You ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?

1553
01:58:16,299 --> 01:58:17,793
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1554
01:58:17,967 --> 01:58:21,217
He killed your woman. He made you...

1555
01:58:21,387 --> 01:58:22,418
...like this.

1556
01:58:22,805 --> 01:58:25,805
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1557
01:58:25,975 --> 01:58:28,596
I want whoever let him off the leash.

1558
01:58:29,311 --> 01:58:32,644
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1559
01:58:32,815 --> 01:58:35,436
Who picked up Rachel?
Must have been someone she trusted.

1560
01:58:36,652 --> 01:58:38,774
Look, if I tell you...

1561
01:58:38,946 --> 01:58:39,977
...will you let me go?

1562
01:58:40,739 --> 01:58:42,067
Can't hurt your chances.

1563
01:58:44,827 --> 01:58:46,486
It was Ramirez.

1564
01:58:51,917 --> 01:58:55,167
-But you said...
-I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1565
01:58:58,757 --> 01:59:00,879
You're a lucky man.

1566
01:59:04,346 --> 01:59:06,089
-But he's not.
-Who?

1567
01:59:09,017 --> 01:59:10,427
Your driver.

1568
01:59:23,657 --> 01:59:24,688
Stand back.

1569
01:59:24,866 --> 01:59:27,191
Hey, that ain't right.
We should be on that boat.

1570
01:59:27,369 --> 01:59:29,942
You wanna ride across
with them? Be my guest.

1571
01:59:53,186 --> 01:59:54,893
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1572
01:59:55,062 --> 01:59:56,093
Right, get on the radio.

1573
01:59:56,272 --> 01:59:59,890
Tell them we'll come back and pick
them up once we dump the scumbags.

1574
02:00:00,067 --> 02:00:02,439
Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.

1575
02:00:04,488 --> 02:00:05,686
What the heck was that?

1576
02:00:07,616 --> 02:00:09,074
What the...?

1577
02:00:09,618 --> 02:00:12,903
Liberty,
come in, please. This is Spirit. Come in.

1578
02:00:14,540 --> 02:00:16,413
Liberty, we have the same thing.
We've lost both engines.

1579
02:00:16,584 --> 02:00:18,078
-Liberty, come in.
Fox.

1580
02:00:18,252 --> 02:00:20,742
There's something going on
on the ferries.

1581
02:00:21,505 --> 02:00:23,793
Get down to the engine room now.

1582
02:00:24,425 --> 02:00:26,631
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1583
02:00:35,227 --> 02:00:38,678
Captain, we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1584
02:00:51,785 --> 02:00:52,864
Oh, my God.

1585
02:00:53,036 --> 02:00:54,862
Looks like some kind of detonator.

1586
02:00:55,038 --> 02:00:57,908
Why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb?

1587
02:01:00,836 --> 02:01:02,211
Tonight, you're all gonna...

1588
02:01:02,379 --> 02:01:04,122
... be a part of a social experiment.

1589
02:01:07,968 --> 02:01:11,799
Through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate...

1590
02:01:11,972 --> 02:01:16,052
... I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky-high.

1591
02:01:16,226 --> 02:01:18,302
Liberty, come in, over.

1592
02:01:19,771 --> 02:01:20,802
It's dead.

1593
02:01:21,147 --> 02:01:25,643
If anyone attempts
to get off their boat, you all die.

1594
02:01:25,985 --> 02:01:27,265
I'm zeroing in.

1595
02:01:27,445 --> 02:01:31,988
Each of you has a remote
to blow up the other boat.

1596
02:01:32,158 --> 02:01:34,613
His voice is on the ferry...

1597
02:01:34,786 --> 02:01:36,825
...but it's not the source.

1598
02:01:39,082 --> 02:01:40,196
West.

1599
02:01:47,465 --> 02:01:49,753
-Gordon.
I have the Joker's location.

1600
02:01:49,926 --> 02:01:51,005
Prewitt Building.

1601
02:01:51,177 --> 02:01:53,632
Assemble on the building opposite.

1602
02:01:55,014 --> 02:01:57,801
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1603
02:01:57,975 --> 02:02:03,135
lf, however, one of you presses
the button, I'll let that boat live.

1604
02:02:03,314 --> 02:02:05,436
So who 's it gonna be?

1605
02:02:05,608 --> 02:02:08,145
Harvey Dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...

1606
02:02:08,319 --> 02:02:11,652
... or the sweet and innocent civilians?

1607
02:02:11,822 --> 02:02:14,359
You choose.

1608
02:02:14,533 --> 02:02:16,442
Oh, and you might wanna
decide quickly...

1609
02:02:16,619 --> 02:02:20,948
... because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.

1610
02:02:28,338 --> 02:02:29,369
Stay back.

1611
02:02:29,548 --> 02:02:33,331
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.

1612
02:02:33,719 --> 02:02:37,301
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1613
02:02:37,931 --> 02:02:41,714
-We are not going to talk about this.
-Why aren't we talking about it?

1614
02:02:41,893 --> 02:02:44,466
They're talking over the same thing
on the other boat.

1615
02:02:44,646 --> 02:02:46,934
-Let's put it to a vote.
Yes!

1616
02:02:52,237 --> 02:02:54,810
-Hello?
Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.

1617
02:02:54,990 --> 02:02:58,026
Jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away.

1618
02:02:58,201 --> 02:02:59,908
But the units outside...

1619
02:03:00,078 --> 02:03:01,655
Those cops can 't be trusted.

1620
02:03:01,830 --> 02:03:04,783
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1621
02:03:04,958 --> 02:03:07,911
I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.

1622
02:03:08,086 --> 02:03:11,917
-But where am I supposed to take them?
-25052nd Street.

1623
02:03:12,090 --> 02:03:13,963
Leave as soon as
the patrol car pulls out.

1624
02:03:14,133 --> 02:03:15,508
Okay.

1625
02:03:15,885 --> 02:03:17,676
She believe you?

1626
02:03:17,887 --> 02:03:19,926
It's because she trusts you...

1627
02:03:20,265 --> 02:03:21,344
...just like Rachel did.

1628
02:03:21,516 --> 02:03:23,592
-I didn't know...
-Didn't know what they'd do?

1629
02:03:23,768 --> 02:03:26,519
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1630
02:03:26,771 --> 02:03:28,893
What exactly did you think
they were gonna do?

1631
02:03:29,065 --> 02:03:31,306
They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills...

1632
02:03:31,484 --> 02:03:34,520
-Don't!
-I'm sorry.

1633
02:03:35,071 --> 02:03:37,526
You live to fight another day, officer.

1634
02:03:41,327 --> 02:03:43,153
We found the missing hospital bus.

1635
02:03:43,329 --> 02:03:45,036
Then we have a hostage situation.

1636
02:03:47,124 --> 02:03:49,116
It's a shooting gallery.

1637
02:03:49,502 --> 02:03:51,790
Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows?

1638
02:03:51,962 --> 02:03:53,788
We have clear shots on five clowns.

1639
02:03:53,964 --> 02:03:56,715
Snipers take them out,
smash the windows, a team rappels in.

1640
02:03:57,134 --> 02:03:58,628
Team moves in by the stairwells.

1641
02:03:58,802 --> 02:04:00,924
Two, three casualties max.

1642
02:04:01,096 --> 02:04:02,969
-Let's do it.
It's not that simple.

1643
02:04:03,140 --> 02:04:05,465
-With the Joker, it never is.
-What's simple is...

1644
02:04:05,643 --> 02:04:08,809
...every second, those people on
the ferries get closer to blowing...

1645
02:04:08,979 --> 02:04:11,516
-That won't happen.
-Then he'll blow both of them up!

1646
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:15,438
-We don't have time for paper ballots.
-I want everybody to put their votes...

1647
02:04:15,611 --> 02:04:17,603
...on this piece of paper.

1648
02:04:18,655 --> 02:04:21,490
If anyone's got pens, pass it along.

1649
02:04:21,825 --> 02:04:23,616
Thank you.
Anybody else?

1650
02:04:23,785 --> 02:04:25,611
Coming through. Anybody else?
Thank you.

1651
02:04:25,787 --> 02:04:28,657
We need to get these votes in quickly.

1652
02:04:28,832 --> 02:04:30,374
Come on.

1653
02:04:32,377 --> 02:04:34,499
What are you waiting for?
Push the button!

1654
02:04:34,671 --> 02:04:36,628
We're running out of time!

1655
02:04:37,924 --> 02:04:39,750
I need five minutes alone.

1656
02:04:39,926 --> 02:04:41,752
No! There's no time!

1657
02:04:41,928 --> 02:04:43,338
We have clear shots!

1658
02:04:43,513 --> 02:04:46,430
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!

1659
02:04:46,600 --> 02:04:48,557
I have to save Dent.

1660
02:04:48,727 --> 02:04:49,841
Get ready.

1661
02:04:52,689 --> 02:04:55,358
Two minutes, then we breach.

1662
02:05:00,947 --> 02:05:02,441
Fox, I need picture.

1663
02:05:05,493 --> 02:05:07,948
-Hello?
Jim, we're in trouble.

1664
02:05:09,205 --> 02:05:11,493
Okay, you got POV on alpha...

1665
02:05:12,542 --> 02:05:14,499
... omni on beta.

1666
02:05:15,962 --> 02:05:19,330
Looks like clowns and hostages
on two floors.

1667
02:05:19,507 --> 02:05:21,914
There's a SWA T team on the stairwell.

1668
02:05:25,221 --> 02:05:27,842
Another SWA T team on the roof.

1669
02:05:29,392 --> 02:05:30,590
Line's clear.

1670
02:05:32,353 --> 02:05:35,057
-Barbara, calm down.
-He has the kids!

1671
02:05:35,231 --> 02:05:38,481
Hello, Jim.
-Harvey?

1672
02:05:39,276 --> 02:05:42,479
-Where's my family?
-Where my family died.

1673
02:05:45,574 --> 02:05:47,233
Blue team, acquire the target.

1674
02:05:48,911 --> 02:05:51,484
Entry team, set your charge.

1675
02:06:07,429 --> 02:06:09,255
Fox, the SWA Ts are
targeting the wrong people.

1676
02:06:09,431 --> 02:06:10,925
The clowns are the hostages.

1677
02:06:11,642 --> 02:06:13,433
Red team, go! Red team, go!

1678
02:06:17,189 --> 02:06:18,599
Entry team, blow and go!

1679
02:06:22,694 --> 02:06:24,104
Don't move.

1680
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:26,655
Take the shot.

1681
02:06:32,287 --> 02:06:33,946
Those SWA Ts are coming in hot.

1682
02:06:34,122 --> 02:06:35,948
Clowns, put down your guns.

1683
02:06:36,458 --> 02:06:39,079
Drop your weapons!
On the ground, now!

1684
02:06:39,294 --> 02:06:42,460
Doctors, get down!
Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap...

1685
02:07:07,071 --> 02:07:08,233
Freeze!

1686
02:07:08,406 --> 02:07:10,778
Stand down or you will be...

1687
02:07:14,328 --> 02:07:15,786
Look up.

1688
02:07:16,372 --> 02:07:18,945
See those bad guys on the floor above?

1689
02:07:19,125 --> 02:07:22,125
They're waiting to ambush
the SWA T team coming up the elevator.

1690
02:07:22,586 --> 02:07:23,617
Sixty seconds.

1691
02:07:31,929 --> 02:07:36,507
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1692
02:07:44,650 --> 02:07:47,187
So go ahead. Do it.

1693
02:07:47,361 --> 02:07:49,353
We're still here.

1694
02:07:50,531 --> 02:07:53,484
And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

1695
02:07:54,952 --> 02:07:56,695
Go, go, go!

1696
02:07:56,870 --> 02:07:58,661
Blue team, cover!

1697
02:08:01,625 --> 02:08:02,656
Uh-oh.

1698
02:08:04,169 --> 02:08:05,828
Trouble on the floor above.

1699
02:08:15,180 --> 02:08:16,555
Get down on the ground now!

1700
02:08:24,981 --> 02:08:27,388
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.

1701
02:08:27,567 --> 02:08:29,559
We will shoot you. Drop the officer.

1702
02:08:29,736 --> 02:08:31,278
Release the officer right now.

1703
02:08:31,446 --> 02:08:33,403
Let him go now!
On your knees!

1704
02:08:33,990 --> 02:08:36,066
We got him. He's out of the game.

1705
02:08:36,242 --> 02:08:38,732
Keep your hands in the air!
Step away from the edge!

1706
02:08:46,794 --> 02:08:48,418
Halt!

1707
02:09:01,726 --> 02:09:03,101
Stay down!
Don't move!

1708
02:09:03,269 --> 02:09:07,562
Be advised. Clowns
are hostages, doctors are targets.

1709
02:09:13,863 --> 02:09:16,021
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1710
02:09:16,198 --> 02:09:19,364
-Where's the detonator?
-Go get him.

1711
02:09:32,756 --> 02:09:35,840
Put down your weapon!
Don't move!

1712
02:10:07,249 --> 02:10:09,122
You don't wanna die...

1713
02:10:09,292 --> 02:10:12,328
...but you don't know how to take a life.

1714
02:10:12,504 --> 02:10:14,163
Give it to me.

1715
02:10:14,464 --> 02:10:18,793
These men will kill you
and take it anyway.

1716
02:10:22,222 --> 02:10:24,712
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1717
02:10:24,891 --> 02:10:27,844
Fine. I'll do it.

1718
02:10:29,521 --> 02:10:32,225
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.

1719
02:10:32,398 --> 02:10:34,686
They chose to murder and steal.

1720
02:10:34,859 --> 02:10:38,062
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1721
02:10:47,538 --> 02:10:49,993
All the old familiar places.

1722
02:10:56,297 --> 02:10:57,376
Stand by.

1723
02:11:07,725 --> 02:11:11,307
Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.

1724
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:13,596
Give it to me.

1725
02:11:15,024 --> 02:11:18,772
You can tell them I took it by force.

1726
02:11:19,278 --> 02:11:24,189
Give it to me, and I'll do what
you should've did 10 minutes ago.

1727
02:11:46,263 --> 02:11:49,596
We really should stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1728
02:11:49,766 --> 02:11:51,592
There won't be any fireworks.

1729
02:11:52,018 --> 02:11:55,221
And here we go.

1730
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:36,469
What were you trying to prove?

1731
02:12:36,646 --> 02:12:39,599
That deep down,
everyone's as ugly as you?

1732
02:12:40,733 --> 02:12:41,764
You're alone.

1733
02:12:48,366 --> 02:12:53,870
Can't rely on anyone these days. You
gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?

1734
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:56,915
That's okay. I came prepared.

1735
02:12:57,124 --> 02:13:01,584
It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of
which, you know how I got these scars?

1736
02:13:01,754 --> 02:13:04,589
No, but I know how you got these.

1737
02:13:22,399 --> 02:13:25,150
Oh, you.

1738
02:13:25,319 --> 02:13:28,355
You just couldn't let me go, could you?

1739
02:13:29,489 --> 02:13:33,403
This is what happens
when an unstoppable force...

1740
02:13:33,577 --> 02:13:38,037
...meets an immovable object.

1741
02:13:38,623 --> 02:13:44,043
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

1742
02:13:44,212 --> 02:13:46,916
Huh? You won't kill me...

1743
02:13:47,090 --> 02:13:53,341
...out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness.

1744
02:13:53,513 --> 02:13:56,716
And I won't kill you...

1745
02:13:56,891 --> 02:14:00,674
...because you're just too much fun.

1746
02:14:01,729 --> 02:14:05,892
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

1747
02:14:06,067 --> 02:14:08,059
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1748
02:14:08,236 --> 02:14:10,062
Maybe we could share one.

1749
02:14:10,238 --> 02:14:11,696
You know,
they'll be doubling up...

1750
02:14:11,864 --> 02:14:14,401
...the rate this city's inhabitants
are losing their minds.

1751
02:14:14,575 --> 02:14:17,694
This city just showed you...

1752
02:14:17,870 --> 02:14:21,914
...that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.

1753
02:14:22,083 --> 02:14:25,249
Until their spirit breaks completely.

1754
02:14:26,129 --> 02:14:30,956
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent...

1755
02:14:31,133 --> 02:14:33,920
...and all the heroic things he's done.

1756
02:14:35,596 --> 02:14:40,637
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul...

1757
02:14:40,810 --> 02:14:43,727
...in a fistfight with you?

1758
02:14:44,271 --> 02:14:45,813
No.

1759
02:14:45,981 --> 02:14:49,396
You need an ace in the hole.

1760
02:14:49,568 --> 02:14:51,192
Mine's Harvey.

1761
02:14:51,570 --> 02:14:53,277
What did you do?

1762
02:14:53,447 --> 02:14:56,447
I took Gotham's white knight...

1763
02:14:56,617 --> 02:15:00,235
...and I brought him down to our level.

1764
02:15:00,663 --> 02:15:03,616
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...

1765
02:15:03,791 --> 02:15:06,827
...is like gravity.

1766
02:15:07,002 --> 02:15:09,327
All it takes is a little push.

1767
02:15:26,271 --> 02:15:28,014
Dent!

1768
02:15:49,002 --> 02:15:53,331
This is where they brought her,
Gordon, after your men handed her over.

1769
02:15:54,090 --> 02:15:55,667
This is where she died.

1770
02:15:55,842 --> 02:15:58,167
I know, I was here...

1771
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:01,971
...trying to save her.
-But you didn't.

1772
02:16:02,265 --> 02:16:04,008
-I couldn't.
-Yes, you could've.

1773
02:16:04,183 --> 02:16:05,677
If you'd listened to me.

1774
02:16:05,852 --> 02:16:08,473
If you stood up against corruption...

1775
02:16:08,646 --> 02:16:10,852
...instead of doing your deal
with the devil.

1776
02:16:11,023 --> 02:16:12,647
I was trying to fight the Mob!

1777
02:16:13,151 --> 02:16:17,978
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what I'd lost.

1778
02:16:19,282 --> 02:16:22,401
Have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most...

1779
02:16:22,577 --> 02:16:26,444
...tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?

1780
02:16:28,124 --> 02:16:31,991
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1781
02:16:32,753 --> 02:16:36,620
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1782
02:16:38,384 --> 02:16:41,966
-You're not going to hurt my family.
-No.

1783
02:16:42,137 --> 02:16:44,841
Just the person you love most.

1784
02:16:52,856 --> 02:16:55,892
So is it your wife?

1785
02:16:56,985 --> 02:16:58,644
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1786
02:16:59,029 --> 02:17:00,688
Harvey, put down the gun.

1787
02:17:00,864 --> 02:17:04,398
Please. Please, Harvey. Please.

1788
02:17:05,786 --> 02:17:07,066
Oh, goddamn it.

1789
02:17:07,245 --> 02:17:09,403
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family?

1790
02:17:09,915 --> 02:17:11,574
No!
-We have a winner.

1791
02:17:11,750 --> 02:17:13,244
No, Jim, stop him!

1792
02:17:13,752 --> 02:17:15,578
Harvey.
Don't let him...

1793
02:17:15,754 --> 02:17:16,868
Harvey!

1794
02:17:18,256 --> 02:17:20,129
I'm sorry!

1795
02:17:21,927 --> 02:17:23,006
For everything.

1796
02:17:25,597 --> 02:17:27,803
Please don't hurt my son.

1797
02:17:37,942 --> 02:17:39,519
You brought your cops?

1798
02:17:39,694 --> 02:17:42,564
All they know is there's a situation.

1799
02:17:42,739 --> 02:17:45,739
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1800
02:17:45,909 --> 02:17:48,578
You think I wanna escape from this?

1801
02:17:48,745 --> 02:17:51,496
There is no escape from this.

1802
02:17:51,664 --> 02:17:53,786
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1803
02:17:56,085 --> 02:17:59,288
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1804
02:18:00,047 --> 02:18:04,258
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.

1805
02:18:07,054 --> 02:18:08,133
But you were wrong.

1806
02:18:08,848 --> 02:18:12,631
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...

1807
02:18:13,394 --> 02:18:15,303
...is chance.

1808
02:18:15,479 --> 02:18:17,186
Unbiased.

1809
02:18:17,398 --> 02:18:18,642
Unprejudiced.

1810
02:18:20,025 --> 02:18:21,139
Fair.

1811
02:18:21,318 --> 02:18:23,559
His son's got the same chance she had.

1812
02:18:24,321 --> 02:18:25,601
Fifty-fifty.

1813
02:18:25,781 --> 02:18:29,232
What happened to Rachel wasn't
chance. We decided to act.

1814
02:18:29,577 --> 02:18:30,905
We three.

1815
02:18:31,078 --> 02:18:34,493
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?

1816
02:18:37,001 --> 02:18:39,622
-It wasn't.
-The Joker chose me.

1817
02:18:39,795 --> 02:18:42,083
Because you were the best of us.

1818
02:18:42,256 --> 02:18:47,250
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...

1819
02:18:47,427 --> 02:18:49,170
...could fall.

1820
02:18:49,513 --> 02:18:50,793
And he was right.

1821
02:18:50,973 --> 02:18:53,214
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1822
02:18:53,392 --> 02:18:56,428
So point it at the people responsible.

1823
02:18:57,396 --> 02:18:59,222
Fair enough.

1824
02:19:02,567 --> 02:19:04,440
You first.

1825
02:19:16,957 --> 02:19:18,616
My turn.

1826
02:19:25,548 --> 02:19:27,540
Harvey, you're right.

1827
02:19:28,593 --> 02:19:31,214
Rachel's death was my fault.

1828
02:19:34,307 --> 02:19:36,762
Please don't punish the boy.

1829
02:19:37,852 --> 02:19:41,055
-Please, punish me.
-I'm about to.

1830
02:19:43,024 --> 02:19:44,981
Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1831
02:19:45,443 --> 02:19:47,067
Lie...

1832
02:19:47,570 --> 02:19:48,684
...like I lied.

1833
02:19:52,450 --> 02:19:54,027
It's going to be all right, son.

1834
02:20:32,448 --> 02:20:35,283
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

1835
02:20:51,800 --> 02:20:53,958
-Thank you.
-You don't have to thank me.

1836
02:20:54,594 --> 02:20:56,385
Yes, I do.

1837
02:21:00,642 --> 02:21:01,970
The Joker won.

1838
02:21:04,396 --> 02:21:07,266
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1839
02:21:07,816 --> 02:21:09,559
...undone.

1840
02:21:10,068 --> 02:21:14,979
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1841
02:21:15,156 --> 02:21:16,318
We bet it all on him.

1842
02:21:17,659 --> 02:21:20,529
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1843
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:22,530
People will lose hope.

1844
02:21:22,705 --> 02:21:24,448
They won't.

1845
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:28,833
They must never know what he did.

1846
02:21:29,003 --> 02:21:30,829
Five dead.

1847
02:21:31,130 --> 02:21:32,410
Two of them cops.

1848
02:21:32,590 --> 02:21:35,045
-You can't sweep that...
-No.

1849
02:21:39,847 --> 02:21:42,682
But the Joker cannot win.

1850
02:21:47,939 --> 02:21:51,142
Gotham needs its true hero.

1851
02:21:57,531 --> 02:22:00,567
-No.
-You either die a hero...

1852
02:22:00,743 --> 02:22:05,203
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

1853
02:22:05,372 --> 02:22:07,198
I can do those things...

1854
02:22:07,625 --> 02:22:10,661
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

1855
02:22:13,672 --> 02:22:16,542
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1856
02:22:16,717 --> 02:22:18,626
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1857
02:22:18,802 --> 02:22:21,375
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1858
02:22:23,056 --> 02:22:24,170
Call it in.

1859
02:22:27,477 --> 02:22:29,220
A hero.

1860
02:22:29,396 --> 02:22:32,646
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1861
02:22:33,233 --> 02:22:35,770
Nothing less than a knight...

1862
02:22:36,320 --> 02:22:38,027
...shining.

1863
02:22:38,655 --> 02:22:40,279
They'll hunt you.

1864
02:22:40,449 --> 02:22:42,240
You'll hunt me.

1865
02:22:42,743 --> 02:22:44,700
You'll condemn me.

1866
02:22:45,412 --> 02:22:47,700
Set the dogs on me.

1867
02:22:51,459 --> 02:22:53,747
Because that's what needs to happen.

1868
02:22:54,921 --> 02:22:56,830
Because sometimes...

1869
02:22:57,007 --> 02:22:59,165
... the truth isn 't good enough.

1870
02:23:00,051 --> 02:23:02,339
Sometimes people deserve more.

1871
02:23:05,807 --> 02:23:09,721
Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.

1872
02:23:28,121 --> 02:23:29,780
Batman.

1873
02:23:31,707 --> 02:23:33,450
Batman!

1874
02:23:34,252 --> 02:23:36,209
Why's he running, Dad?

1875
02:23:37,255 --> 02:23:38,583
Because we have to chase him.

1876
02:23:38,756 --> 02:23:41,626
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

1877
02:23:47,723 --> 02:23:49,300
He didn't do anything wrong.

1878
02:23:52,061 --> 02:23:57,647
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1879
02:23:59,068 --> 02:24:00,099
So we'll hunt him...

1880
02:24:03,238 --> 02:24:05,314
... because he can take it.

1881
02:24:07,826 --> 02:24:10,316
Because he's not our hero.

1882
02:24:17,878 --> 02:24:19,076
He's a silent guardian...

1883
02:24:20,255 --> 02:24:22,128
...a watchful protector.

1884
02:24:24,635 --> 02:24:25,915
A dark knight.
