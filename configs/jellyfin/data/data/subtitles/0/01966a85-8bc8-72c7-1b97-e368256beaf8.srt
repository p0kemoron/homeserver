1
00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:40,446
200 bucks.

2
00:00:40,606 --> 00:00:43,286
I'm in.

3
00:00:43,446 --> 00:00:44,606
Out.

4
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:59,966
Relax, Cliff, you're amongst
friends who wanna help you.

5
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,966
Isn't that right, Vanessa?

6
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:04,926
That's right, Mick.

7
00:01:05,086 --> 00:01:08,006
Look, we're all aware
of how stressful debt can be.

8
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:11,006
And none of us enjoys
its ugly consequences.

9
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:12,606
None of us, Cleave.

10
00:01:12,766 --> 00:01:16,726
So Mick and I decided it would be
better to sit down with you calmly,

11
00:01:16,886 --> 00:01:21,406
and, you know, just map out a plan
that provides...certainty.

12
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:23,766
So, as you can see here,

13
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:27,366
Mick and I have decided
to roll the two debts into one.

14
00:01:27,526 --> 00:01:29,726
And that's because
of our longstanding

15
00:01:29,886 --> 00:01:31,686
and close relationship with you.

16
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:34,006
My father loved you like a brother.

17
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,606
I know that.

18
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:38,526
We've agreed,
and this is exclusively for you,

19
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:42,806
on an interest rate
of 29%, compounded weekly.

20
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:46,526
This 29% is,
if you turn the page...

21
00:01:46,686 --> 00:01:49,246
..it's subject to
a confidentiality clause.

22
00:01:49,406 --> 00:01:50,766
So don't tell anyone.

23
00:01:50,926 --> 00:01:54,766
Otherwise it'll literally become
crippling interest.

24
00:01:55,886 --> 00:01:57,966
You understand, Cleave?

25
00:01:58,126 --> 00:02:00,966
You understand, Cleave?
Yep.

26
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:04,366
Pretty much.

27
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,926
Does Barney know where you are?

28
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:23,886
Yes. I'm at my sister's.

29
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:33,926
Ah! Oah!
Ah!

30
00:02:34,086 --> 00:02:35,766
Oooh!
Oh!

31
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:42,366
Oh-ho.

32
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,846
Mmm.

33
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:50,926
I told my shrink

34
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:53,126
that I was thinking
of having an affair.

35
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:57,806
Always a good solution
to marital difficulties, Red.

36
00:02:57,966 --> 00:02:59,326
Spread the pain.

37
00:02:59,486 --> 00:03:01,686
What did she say?

38
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:05,206
Well, she said that it might make me
feel better in the short term,

39
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:08,366
but that it would come back
to haunt me like Banquo's ghost.

40
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:10,686
She'd be right, for once.

41
00:03:11,766 --> 00:03:13,526
So beat it, Red.

42
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:18,766
Come on. Stand not upon the order
of your going, knucklehead.

43
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:23,166
Just, you know, bugger off

44
00:03:23,326 --> 00:03:25,806
back to your husband and kids.

45
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:30,046
What did you expect?
You've been together a long time.

46
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:31,526
It's gonna change.

47
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:35,726
And how
would you know? Hmm?

48
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:39,566
The longest relationship you've ever
had has been with a prostitute.

49
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:42,086
Oh, don't start
swinging wildly, sweetheart.

50
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:45,846
This isn't about me.
For once.

51
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:50,086
So you're full-time
at Chasers, are you, Marty?

52
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:52,926
Pretty much.
Pretty much.

53
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:56,126
Oh, you know, other things come up.

54
00:03:56,286 --> 00:03:59,286
Mmm.
Odd jobs. Life.

55
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:02,246
So that's it. It's over.

56
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:06,446
It's all done without Barney
even knowing it's been going on.

57
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:09,526
His life as he knows it — gone.

58
00:04:09,686 --> 00:04:11,086
No right of reply.

59
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:12,726
Oh, fuck you, Cleaver.

60
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,006
I suppose
you saved him a lot of bother.

61
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:18,326
I mean, I do understand your point
because he's not that bright, is he?

62
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:21,326
I mean, he's completely lacking when
it comes to insight and integrity.

63
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:25,606
I mean, he wouldn't be able to
contribute to a worthwhile dialogue

64
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,846
about the marriage
you're meant to be sharing.

65
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:33,446
So it's better that you keep it
in your internal monologue, Red.

66
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,566
That way it'll be sorted out
to YOUR satisfaction.

67
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:44,590
http://hiqve.com/

68
00:04:47,966 --> 00:04:50,246
Red.

69
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:52,806
- Yeah?
- Mate, it's me.

70
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:03,526
So my brother's a doctor and every
time I get called for jury duty,

71
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:05,006
I've got a medical certificate.

72
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,486
I didn't mind it. It was fun.

73
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:09,406
Mm-hm. What sort of case
did you get?

74
00:05:09,566 --> 00:05:11,206
Hit the jackpot.

75
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:13,286
We got a murder.
Oh, really?

76
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,686
There was something about
her voice on the phone.

77
00:05:17,686 --> 00:05:21,686
Just sounded so...alien.

78
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:26,286
I went round to her sister's,
but she said she'd left.

79
00:05:27,686 --> 00:05:29,686
I'm not sure she'd even been there.

80
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:33,766
You must've read about it —
the model and the footy star?

81
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:35,486
Oh, wow.

82
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:37,646
Now, what was her name?

83
00:05:37,806 --> 00:05:40,806
Oh, don't tell me what it is because
I read it in all the papers.

84
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,886
Um... Oh!
Tanisha Marx.

85
00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:47,606
Tanisha Marx and Gavin Warner.

86
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:49,086
Mmm.
Mmm.

87
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:50,566
Oh, it was pretty cool.

88
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:54,006
Mm-hm. So she did it, yeah?

89
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:57,606
Yeah. Well, that was our verdict.

90
00:05:57,766 --> 00:05:59,486
What do you mean?

91
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:01,206
I shouldn't be talking about it.

92
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:02,966
Mmm.
No.

93
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:05,166
Course not. Mmm.

94
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:07,646
So there's gotta be
another guy, right?

95
00:06:07,806 --> 00:06:11,086
No. No! Not necessarily at all.

96
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:14,966
Marriages go through phases, mate.

97
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:17,806
Yeah, we've been in a rut.

98
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:19,926
I acknowledge that.

99
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:22,766
I absolutely acknowledge that.

100
00:06:24,246 --> 00:06:26,046
But, you know,
not a day goes by still

101
00:06:26,206 --> 00:06:28,206
where I don't thank God
for the miracle of her.

102
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:31,006
I mean, look at me.

103
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,806
Look at her.

104
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:37,366
You'd never think in a million years
she'd choose me.

105
00:06:38,406 --> 00:06:42,046
Go home, mate. Tell her exactly that.

106
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:47,126
Oh...oh, God.

107
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:48,606
Oh, God!

108
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:51,606
How did she do it, again?

109
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:54,886
What? How did who do what?

110
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:58,446
Tanisha Marx.
How did she kill Gav Warner?

111
00:06:58,606 --> 00:07:00,166
You wanna talk about this now?

112
00:07:00,326 --> 00:07:02,726
Oh, I'm into crime.
It sort of turns me on.

113
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:05,406
She stabbed him.
She dumped the body in the bush.

114
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:07,766
He was a big guy, wasn't he?

115
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,846
Yeah.
Yeah.

116
00:07:10,006 --> 00:07:12,126
Yeah, that was the thing.
What thing?

117
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:13,846
Well, he WAS a big guy.

118
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:17,566
I mean, how she even managed
to get the body in the car...

119
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:21,806
So you had a doubt?
A little.

120
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:24,086
Aren't you meant to acquit then?

121
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:29,566
Well...I really
shouldn't be telling you this.

122
00:07:36,326 --> 00:07:37,886
Come on, Red.

123
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:45,726
Home you go.

124
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:54,126
That is filthy, by the way.

125
00:07:57,286 --> 00:07:57,366
Well, he was a big guy.

126
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:59,086
Well, he was a big guy.

127
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:02,886
I mean, how she even managed
to get the body in the car...

128
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:07,406
So you had a doubt?
A little.

129
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:09,046
Aren't you meant to acquit then?

130
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:14,606
Well...I really shouldn't
be telling you this.

131
00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:18,366
Gav Warner's cousin...
Yeah, what about him?

132
00:08:18,526 --> 00:08:21,726
Turns out he was a mate
of the head juror.

133
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:23,886
Kidding me. Fucking kidding me.

134
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,646
..Tanisha was a real bitch.

135
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,486
I have fought
to prove my daughter's innocence

136
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:32,646
from the day
of Gavin's tragic death.

137
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:35,966
And this recording proves
that at least one member of the jury

138
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:38,126
had serious doubts
about Tanisha's guilt

139
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:41,806
and that the jury foreman
had a connection to Gavin Warner

140
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:43,446
that he didn't disclose.

141
00:08:44,886 --> 00:08:47,686
And my little girl had her
19th birthday in prison last week.

142
00:08:47,846 --> 00:08:49,286
Here you go.
Here come the waterworks.

143
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,926
Because that man...

144
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:52,446
Sorry.

145
00:08:52,606 --> 00:08:54,286
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:55,926
..the jury foreman —

147
00:08:56,086 --> 00:08:58,926
he bullied other jurors
into finding my daughter guilty.

148
00:09:03,286 --> 00:09:05,406
What, so...this is...this is her
at her daughter's trial?

149
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:06,726
Yeah.

150
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:09,326
Well... shit.

151
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:12,566
Wouldn't have recognised her.
Looks like she's lost about 20 pounds.

152
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:13,806
Just fuck off!

153
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:17,006
Had a complete makeover,
apparently, boss.

154
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,646
And went out hunting jurors.

155
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:24,606
Right, so, she loses 20 pounds,
has a complete makeover,

156
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:27,246
gives this idiot a blow job,
and we're gonna send her to jail?

157
00:09:27,406 --> 00:09:29,846
Bill? Bill? She was right!

158
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:32,766
Hey? The system failed
both her and her daughter.

159
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:35,366
But you're the Attorney-General.
You can't say that.

160
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:37,886
I mean, you're responsible
FOR the system.

161
00:09:38,046 --> 00:09:39,366
Oh, right. My fault now, is it?

162
00:09:39,526 --> 00:09:42,486
Fucking typical — I'm responsible
for a system I can't control, eh?

163
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:44,886
What moron came up with the idea
of an independent judiciary?

164
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:47,006
Well, the...the separation
of powers...

165
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,046
Shut up, Bill. Just shut up, alright?

166
00:09:49,206 --> 00:09:50,806
Two things need to happen now.

167
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:54,206
One — Tanisha Marx
needs to get out of jail.

168
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:58,126
Two — Lucy Marx does not go to jail.

169
00:09:58,286 --> 00:10:00,726
Well, you know
that's down to the courts, boss?

170
00:10:00,886 --> 00:10:02,566
Yeah, I'm
the fuckin' Attorney-General.

171
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:04,246
Course I know
it's down to the courts.

172
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:06,006
Idiot.

173
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:08,766
Having now had the opportunity

174
00:10:08,926 --> 00:10:11,126
to investigate the matter in greater detail,
Your Honour,

175
00:10:11,286 --> 00:10:14,486
it would appear, that,
er, the removalists I hired

176
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:16,486
were not responsible
for the destruction

177
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:20,446
of those financial records the
Tax Office has requested access to.

178
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:25,286
Er, it would seem that, er,
those documents were already damaged

179
00:10:25,446 --> 00:10:26,806
prior to the move.

180
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:29,846
And I am reliably informed
by the janitor

181
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:32,246
of my former storage facility,

182
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:34,286
er, a Mr Tergit Erzrin,

183
00:10:34,446 --> 00:10:37,086
that a dormer window
was inadvertently left open

184
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:39,286
during the storm,
which caused considerable flooding

185
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:41,686
in the area
where my documents were housed.

186
00:10:41,846 --> 00:10:43,686
Your Honour,
my friend the respondent

187
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:45,566
has been granted every opportunity

188
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:48,646
to either produce
the subpoenaed records to the ATO

189
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:51,886
or provide a credible reason
for their disappearance.

190
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:54,526
At our last mention,
it was the removalists' fault,

191
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:56,046
now it's the janitor's.

192
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:58,166
What will it be after that?
The dog ate them?

193
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:00,086
Your Honour, we have
been bogged down

194
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:01,966
in procedural issues for 18 months now.

195
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:04,246
And we again respectfully submit

196
00:11:04,406 --> 00:11:07,286
that Mr Greene be required
to produce the financial records

197
00:11:07,446 --> 00:11:10,486
for the relevant period
or be found in contempt.

198
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:13,126
Mr Potter has a point, Mr Greene.

199
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:14,966
I think you've had
more than enough time.

200
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:18,446
Indeed, Your Honour
has been most indulgent,

201
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:21,966
er, but Mr Erzrin
has only recently returned to Sydney

202
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:24,566
after a six-month holiday
visiting relatives in Turkey.

203
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,086
I don't see how
I could have expedited matters

204
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:30,326
in any meaningful way.

205
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:33,286
Mr Erzrin,
could you tell me what happened

206
00:11:33,446 --> 00:11:36,166
on the afternoon of 23 September?

207
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:38,686
I go, for building,

208
00:11:38,846 --> 00:11:40,166
for clean.

209
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:42,446
Rain — bucket dogs.

210
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:44,206
Swish, swish!

211
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:47,806
Floor shine good.
No worries for you.

212
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:49,326
Swish, swish.

213
00:11:49,486 --> 00:11:52,846
But window, er...

214
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,926
Your Honour,
this is getting us nowhere.

215
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,406
I agree, Your Honour.

216
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:03,806
Er, I had hoped to save the court
the cost of a translator,

217
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:05,406
but it would seem to be necessary.

218
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:08,086
Er, no! No, I beg you,
let's keep going.

219
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:12,366
No, in fairness, we are
going to need a Turkish translator.

220
00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:15,086
Now, I have leave starting shortly.

221
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:18,286
We'll reconvene three months hence
on the 24th.

222
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,086
May it please the court.

223
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:24,726
Thank you, Your Honour.

224
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:31,406
See you at
the doggies on Friday night, Cleave?

225
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:33,846
Yeah, I'll try. Thanks, mate.

226
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:37,366
The evidence on which
the appellant seeks to rely

227
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:39,326
was gathered illegally.

228
00:12:39,486 --> 00:12:41,806
And, as such,
we find it inadmissible.

229
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:44,246
This is a grave matter.

230
00:12:44,406 --> 00:12:47,926
It is a cornerstone
of our system of criminal justice

231
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:51,406
that jurors not be harassed
and/or threatened

232
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:54,886
before, during or after a trial.

233
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:57,126
It is the only way
we can maintain confidence

234
00:12:57,286 --> 00:12:58,886
in the independence
of the jury system...

235
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:03,326
This is your idea of justice, is it?! Did
you even bother to listen to the tapes?!

236
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:05,646
Mrs Marx, please restrain yourself.
Did you?

237
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:09,046
Now, you want the public to maintain
their confidence in the jury system,

238
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,086
then fucking do something to fix it!

239
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:13,166
Will the sheriffs
please assist Mrs Marx?

240
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,846
I don't need escorting.

241
00:13:16,406 --> 00:13:18,686
The evidence was as plain
as the hairy ears on their heads.

242
00:13:18,846 --> 00:13:21,126
But no, because
of some legal mumbo jumbo,

243
00:13:21,286 --> 00:13:23,206
my daughter remains in prison.

244
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:25,846
Now, I am calling
on the State Attorney-General

245
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:29,206
to immediately rectify
this gross miscarriage...

246
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:31,166
I can't rectify it.
No, don't have the power, love.

247
00:13:31,326 --> 00:13:33,766
I'm calling on him to have
a Royal Commission into this matter.

248
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,246
Oh, my sainted aunt.

249
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:38,246
..expose the rotten state of justice
in NSW.

250
00:13:38,406 --> 00:13:40,046
I have nothing else to say.

251
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:41,886
She's good.

252
00:13:42,046 --> 00:13:43,566
She's sensational.

253
00:13:43,726 --> 00:13:45,846
She's Joan of Arc.

254
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:48,566
How do I look?

255
00:13:48,726 --> 00:13:51,406
In section 68a of the ‘Jury Act',

256
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:55,166
a person must not solicit
information from or harass a juror,

257
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:58,566
or former juror, for the purpose
of obtaining information

258
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:00,646
about...de-da, de-da,
de-daa, de-daa...

259
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,246
Maximum penalty — seven years.

260
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:04,926
Well, that's fine.

261
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:06,046
Sorry?

262
00:14:06,206 --> 00:14:10,046
Fine. I'm more than happy
to go to jail.

263
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:11,766
You wanna be with your daughter.

264
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:13,406
Oh, that's not the only reason.

265
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:17,166
If you go to jail, there's gonna be
a shit storm in the press.

266
00:14:17,326 --> 00:14:19,286
That's what you're after, isn't it?

267
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:22,806
If I get off,
it'll be a story for five minutes.

268
00:14:22,966 --> 00:14:25,326
If I go to jail, every day
there'll be more questions.

269
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:27,926
There will be more pressure
on my MP, on the Attorney-General,

270
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:29,406
on the Government.

271
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:32,446
Eventually someone will have to do
something about Tanisha.

272
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:37,686
So I am instructing you
to plead guilty.

273
00:14:39,686 --> 00:14:42,166
That's not something we hear
every day, is it?

274
00:14:42,326 --> 00:14:44,686
Now, Lucy, I don't think
you should plead guilty.

275
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:48,006
If it's really a shit storm you want,

276
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,646
plead not guilty.

277
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,206
Make them prove their case.

278
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:52,806
Do you know what I mean?

279
00:14:52,966 --> 00:14:55,206
Let the public see them pursue you —

280
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:58,766
hound a grieving mother
until she's behind bars.

281
00:14:58,926 --> 00:15:01,606
Won't be prosecution,
it'll be persecution.

282
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:03,126
But I will be found guilty?

283
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:04,646
Oh, in my capable hands,

284
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:07,406
I don't see how you could
possibly avoid a jail term.

285
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:11,406
She cannot go to jail.
It would kill us in the press.

286
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,166
And that is also
the Premier's firm view.

287
00:15:13,326 --> 00:15:15,486
Good.
Can't you drop the charges?

288
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:18,366
Well, she's publicly admitted
to a very serious offence.

289
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:20,566
The Director's adamant —
we've no choice but to prosecute.

290
00:15:20,726 --> 00:15:22,086
Yeah, fine. Fine.

291
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:24,166
Far be it from this office
to attempt to interfere

292
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:25,646
with the course of justice.

293
00:15:25,806 --> 00:15:30,086
But is it not the Director
who selects counsel, is it not?

294
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:32,246
So you want someone green?

295
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:34,686
Emerald, I think,
is what we're looking for.

296
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:36,326
Now, who's gonna judge this thing?

297
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:38,606
Do we have a mother
on the bench at the moment?

298
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,606
If not, let's appoint one.

299
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:40,846
It's rather liberating,
don't you think, cock?

300
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:43,526
It's rather liberating,
don't you think, cock?

301
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:44,726
What?

302
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:48,126
Having a client who's guilty
for a very good reason.

303
00:15:48,286 --> 00:15:50,126
And who wants to go to jail.

304
00:15:50,286 --> 00:15:53,166
So even if we screw up,
we're doing the right thing.

305
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:57,006
I wish all my clients
were as guilty as she is.

306
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:59,206
Hey, shouldn't we get going?

307
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:01,486
No, Scarlet's meeting us here
at half past.

308
00:16:01,646 --> 00:16:03,326
Cool.

309
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:07,166
How are things in the marital home?

310
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,846
Very cool.

311
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,686
Did she say where she was
the other night?

312
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,526
No, you were right.
She'd just gone for a drive.

313
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:20,126
If there is nothing else,
my servitude is over for the day.

314
00:16:20,286 --> 00:16:23,926
Nicolette, you have, as always,
been just marvellous.

315
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:25,806
Mmm.
Bloody hell.

316
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:27,526
Is that a ring?

317
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,166
Mm-hm.

318
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:30,406
What?!
Congratulations.

319
00:16:30,566 --> 00:16:31,886
When did this happen?

320
00:16:32,046 --> 00:16:33,366
Oh, three weeks ago.
Oh.

321
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,086
Well, why didn't you say anything?

322
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:38,206
Well, there's a sweep going round
on how long it'd take you to notice.

323
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:39,686
I had two months.

324
00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:41,926
Well, who's the poor bastard?
Who do you think?

325
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:43,806
Bevan.

326
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:46,166
Bevan! Oh.

327
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:47,766
Well...

328
00:16:47,926 --> 00:16:50,286
..at last, an honest woman, eh?

329
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:53,246
Er, how long
have you two been going out, again?

330
00:16:53,406 --> 00:16:55,526
Oh, 11 years.

331
00:16:55,686 --> 00:16:57,086
11 years?
Mmm.

332
00:16:57,246 --> 00:16:59,086
He really is
a bit slow off the mark, isn't he?

333
00:16:59,246 --> 00:17:00,886
Oh, he's had commitment issues.

334
00:17:01,046 --> 00:17:02,686
Has he? And you?

335
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:05,526
Knew the moment I met him
I'd marry him.

336
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:08,846
Wait a minute, weren't you
at school 11 years ago?

337
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:11,006
Mm-hm.
So what are you saying?

338
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,486
He was your first?
Mm-hm.

339
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:13,966
And only.
Mm-hm.

340
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:16,006
You've never been with anyone else?

341
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,166
Mm-mm.

342
00:17:17,326 --> 00:17:18,686
Well, aren't you curious?

343
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:20,646
Cleave.
What, about other men?

344
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,166
Well, yes, about other men.

345
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:24,486
I mean, there's a whole world
of other men out there.

346
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:26,646
Different shapes and colours.

347
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:28,166
Sizes.

348
00:17:28,326 --> 00:17:29,686
And what about women?

349
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:31,206
What about them?

350
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:33,126
Well, how can you possibly know
you're not a lesbian

351
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,686
if you've never been
with another woman?

352
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,606
Yeah, believe me, I know —
not a lesbian.

353
00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:38,446
Oh, you say that now.

354
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:40,446
But five years down the track,

355
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:44,766
you're sitting opposite Bevan in some
tortuously deafening marital silence

356
00:17:44,926 --> 00:17:46,966
thinking about the opportunities
you gave up

357
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:48,926
because you decided
to imprison yourself with one man

358
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:51,846
who may or may not even be
a good root, because who knows?

359
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:53,766
Because we haven't slept
with anybody else.

360
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:57,206
I mean, I understand
people who settle for second best

361
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:59,446
as an informed choice,
but you're not even doing that.

362
00:17:59,606 --> 00:18:01,046
You're just sort of out there

363
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:05,766
in some fantastical
Jane Austen bullshit haze.

364
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:11,046
Anyway. Couldn't be happier.

365
00:18:13,966 --> 00:18:15,646
Little chilly, isn't it?

366
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:23,326
Try not to pull a number
like you did last year, hey, mate?

367
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:26,926
It took Juliet eleven and a half
months to forgive you.

368
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:28,966
Best behaviour, mate. Promise.

369
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:31,446
Looking forward to this.

370
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,686
He didn't even stop at
the light. He just sailed through.

371
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:38,806
I mean, it is a miracle
that no-one was hurt.

372
00:18:38,966 --> 00:18:42,006
There are so many lunatics
on the road nowadays.

373
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,486
Correct.
Mmm.

374
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:46,886
So, Blake, you know, he insisted,
you know, for his own peace of mind,

375
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:48,686
while I'm ferrying
the children around,

376
00:18:48,846 --> 00:18:50,446
and, you know,
I couldn't argue with that.

377
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:54,046
So he test-drove the top four
and then he settled on the Porsche.

378
00:18:54,206 --> 00:18:56,446
You know, and I don't care
what anyone says.

379
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:58,086
You know, it is not
a self-indulgence

380
00:18:58,246 --> 00:19:00,366
when you're trying to keep your kids
out of harm's way.

381
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:02,046
Correct.

382
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:05,206
Here she is.

383
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:10,726
- Hello.
- Hi.

384
00:19:14,886 --> 00:19:16,846
This is Barney. Scarlet.

385
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:18,406
This is Melissa.

386
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:21,126
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Scarlet.

387
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,686
You look lovely.
Thank you.

388
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:29,726
And I said, “Well, you know what?
The dressing gown doesn't help.”

389
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,926
I know, it was a little bit cruel.

390
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:37,246
Oh, that's terrible.
We had to do something.

391
00:19:56,246 --> 00:19:57,086
Hey!

392
00:19:57,246 --> 00:20:00,166
Harry fucking Potter?!

393
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:03,366
You're kidding me.
Tell me it isn't so.

394
00:20:04,366 --> 00:20:06,566
Oh. When did this happen?

395
00:20:06,726 --> 00:20:09,726
Oh, he gave a tax seminar at
law school a couple of months ago.

396
00:20:09,886 --> 00:20:12,966
A tax seminar? That's where
the magic happened, was it?

397
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:15,966
That's where you heard the violins
and felt the earth move —

398
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:17,566
in a tax seminar?

399
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:18,566
Oh, Cleaver, please.

400
00:20:18,726 --> 00:20:21,486
I've been bitching to you
for over a year about this guy.

401
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:24,206
Well, it took me a little while
to put two and two together

402
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:26,126
because you always referred to him
as ‘Harry'.

403
00:20:26,286 --> 00:20:27,846
And he referred to you as ‘the clown'.

404
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:30,526
And a... He refers to me as what?

405
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:32,846
Oh, he says it
with a certain degree of affection.

406
00:20:33,006 --> 00:20:35,166
Missy, the guy's
trying to bankrupt me.

407
00:20:35,326 --> 00:20:37,846
If our time together
means anything to you...

408
00:20:38,006 --> 00:20:39,486
Oh, for God's sake, get a grip.

409
00:20:39,646 --> 00:20:41,486
It's nothing personal.
He took a brief.

410
00:20:41,646 --> 00:20:42,966
He's a prig.

411
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:45,606
He's talented, he's honest,
he's loyal...

412
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:47,206
My point exactly!

413
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:50,006
There are any number of reasons
why he's wrong for you.

414
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:52,846
Missy...

415
00:20:56,526 --> 00:20:59,166
Jesus, Cleave,
would you give it a rest?

416
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:02,966
Have you told him yet?
Told him what?

417
00:21:03,126 --> 00:21:04,966
About your previous life —

418
00:21:05,126 --> 00:21:07,246
as the other kind of solicitor.

419
00:21:08,246 --> 00:21:10,046
I didn't think so.

420
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:23,926
Means I'll have to get
a whole new other Bobcat.

421
00:21:24,086 --> 00:21:26,526
No.
To do them — just to get the other.

422
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:27,886
He did.

423
00:21:28,046 --> 00:21:30,566
Checking it when we were there.
I remember that.

424
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:33,486
And your response.
Oh, bull!

425
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:37,446
So have you met
Cleaver Greene before?

426
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:39,686
Why do you ask?

427
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:43,366
Well, I just saw you two talking
when you were coming out of the loo

428
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:46,006
and it looked oddly intense.

429
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:50,006
Yes, well, as it turns out,

430
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:54,526
Cleaver is an old friend
of a cousin of mine,

431
00:21:54,686 --> 00:21:55,766
Angus.

432
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:57,526
Family black sheep.

433
00:21:57,686 --> 00:22:00,286
Right. Ah.
Ooh, did you hear my mobile?

434
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:02,086
I don't think so.

435
00:22:02,246 --> 00:22:07,166
No. For the thousandth time —
I'm not going to the lvy tonight.

436
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,086
What is it
with these people?

437
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:13,046
OK, so there's more
to that point...

438
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,526
..that I was making.

439
00:22:14,686 --> 00:22:17,406
So just let me say this, OK?
Just be quiet while I say this.

440
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:19,766
Because this really,
really irritates me.

441
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:21,806
And I've thought about it a lot, OK?

442
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:26,606
So what I wanna say is, “You've got
to keep the warring tribes apart.”

443
00:22:26,766 --> 00:22:29,966
You know, it's the wretched politics
that drive me nuts.

444
00:22:30,126 --> 00:22:31,886
It's supposed to be
a happy event.

445
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:34,206
Correct. That is absolutely correct.

446
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:37,126
Oh, excuse me. Er, I'm sorry.

447
00:22:37,286 --> 00:22:38,606
L...Linda, isn't it?

448
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:40,446
Leanne.

449
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:42,406
Leanne, yeah.
Sorry to interrupt, Leanne.

450
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,766
But, um, I'm curious about something.

451
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:46,286
Oh, yes?

452
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:51,406
Yeah. I've noticed you say
the word ‘correct' a lot.

453
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:52,966
Really?
Yeah.

454
00:22:53,126 --> 00:22:54,966
I hadn't noticed.
Yes.

455
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:57,166
When somebody says something
that you agree with,

456
00:22:57,326 --> 00:23:03,166
you don't say ‘yes' or ‘uh-huh'
or even ‘you go, girl'.

457
00:23:03,326 --> 00:23:05,086
You say, ‘correct'.

458
00:23:05,246 --> 00:23:08,246
I'm sorry, you've lost me, Cleaver.

459
00:23:08,406 --> 00:23:10,406
Oh, well, it's...it's sort of like

460
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:12,446
a schoolteacher
talking to a 10-year-old.

461
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:15,366
You know, it's...you're not
actually agreeing,

462
00:23:15,526 --> 00:23:16,886
you're approving.

463
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:20,046
It's as if the statement isn't valid
until you deem it so.

464
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:22,006
Your point being...?

465
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:25,966
Well, it's like
you're an arbiter of the truth.

466
00:23:26,126 --> 00:23:29,366
It's a way of being
smug and superior, Leanne,

467
00:23:29,526 --> 00:23:32,366
which is why so many fuckwits
in the city use it.

468
00:23:32,526 --> 00:23:34,806
And now it's spread into the mouths
of the spouses

469
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:36,686
like some sort of contagion.

470
00:23:36,846 --> 00:23:38,166
Your kids will be saying it soon —

471
00:23:38,326 --> 00:23:41,046
from the back seat
of the four-wheel-drive Porsche,

472
00:23:41,206 --> 00:23:44,726
feeling safe and smug and superior.

473
00:23:44,886 --> 00:23:48,686
Buying a Porsche SUV for the sake
of the kids' safety.

474
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:52,286
I don't think I've heard
such transparently banal bullshit

475
00:23:52,446 --> 00:23:54,366
in my entire life.

476
00:23:58,286 --> 00:24:00,326
You go, girl.

477
00:24:05,406 --> 00:24:07,966
Ah! Harry-sorry-David.

478
00:24:08,126 --> 00:24:09,566
Interesting evening.

479
00:24:09,726 --> 00:24:13,166
Just trying to keep the conversation
chugging along.

480
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,806
So Melissa tells me
you're a friend of her cousin's.

481
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:17,526
Angus.

482
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:19,926
Yes.
Yeah.

483
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:21,646
Yes, old friends.

484
00:24:21,806 --> 00:24:23,126
Old, old friends.

485
00:24:23,286 --> 00:24:25,806
Oh, he's a piece of work,
old Angus is.

486
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,766
A dark horse.

487
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:29,806
Black sheep, she said.

488
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:31,326
Well, I don't know

489
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:34,246
if this racial profiling
of livestock's getting us anywhere.

490
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:39,766
She tell you why
he's such a...dark sheep?

491
00:24:39,926 --> 00:24:40,926
No.

492
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:43,726
Well, they had a thing.

493
00:24:43,886 --> 00:24:46,446
Yeah. He and Melissa.

494
00:24:46,606 --> 00:24:50,806
Romantic thing.
Must've been, er, 10 years ago.

495
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:52,646
She'd have barely been 17.

496
00:24:52,806 --> 00:24:54,726
Yep. It was something like that.

497
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:57,966
He would've been, oh, 38, 39.

498
00:24:58,126 --> 00:25:00,326
Tell me, are they, er...

499
00:25:00,486 --> 00:25:03,206
..are they first...
First cousins. Yeah.

500
00:25:03,366 --> 00:25:06,766
Yes. Ah. The shit hit the fan
when the family found out.

501
00:25:06,926 --> 00:25:08,246
You can imagine.

502
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,766
Lasted the better part of a year.

503
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,886
You must know all this.
Bits.

504
00:25:13,046 --> 00:25:14,046
Yeah.

505
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:15,886
They ran off to Paris together.

506
00:25:16,046 --> 00:25:17,686
All very tempestuous.

507
00:25:17,846 --> 00:25:19,726
She left him,
he tried to top himself,

508
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:22,606
she went back and he went off to work
for Bob Geldof.

509
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:24,846
All very messy.

510
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:26,886
Makes you think.

511
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:30,406
Sure does. The poor darling.

512
00:25:30,566 --> 00:25:33,166
Some of the things
she's had to cope with.

513
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,246
Well, hello.
Mr Greene, how are you?

514
00:25:56,406 --> 00:26:01,686
Battered, Miss Marx, but, er, that's
a pretty common condition for me.

515
00:26:01,846 --> 00:26:04,086
You live around here?
Mmm. Mmm.

516
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:07,286
Just up on Rockwell Crescent.
I have seen you around before.

517
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:08,806
Please sit down.

518
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:10,886
Piccolo, Cleaver?

519
00:26:11,046 --> 00:26:12,886
Oh, thanks, mate.

520
00:26:15,766 --> 00:26:17,246
Max!

521
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:23,566
Whom Whoa.

522
00:26:34,966 --> 00:26:37,566
Er, sorry for the state of my life.

523
00:26:51,646 --> 00:26:52,886
Ah.

524
00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:01,326
Mmm.

525
00:27:09,806 --> 00:27:11,886
Mmm. Oh, Cleaver.

526
00:27:12,046 --> 00:27:13,806
Mmm.

527
00:27:16,646 --> 00:27:18,286
So...

528
00:27:21,366 --> 00:27:23,766
How's the Lucy Marx thing going?

529
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:25,526
She wants to go to jail.

530
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,246
She wants to be a martyr?

531
00:27:27,406 --> 00:27:30,486
Mmm. Nothing wrong with that.
If the cause is right.

532
00:27:32,806 --> 00:27:35,606
You know there's not a soul
at the DPP who worked on that case

533
00:27:35,766 --> 00:27:37,126
who thinks Tanisha's innocent?

534
00:27:37,286 --> 00:27:40,686
Yeah, well, that's because
you guys are the prosecution.

535
00:27:40,846 --> 00:27:43,486
You have that
dominant suspicion gene.

536
00:27:43,646 --> 00:27:46,086
Oh, really?

537
00:27:46,246 --> 00:27:47,126
Mmm.

538
00:27:47,286 --> 00:27:51,486
Come on, even Dennis has his doubts,
and he was her solicitor.

539
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:55,206
Ah, you wanna have a chat with him.

540
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:13,206
You're up early.

541
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:15,526
Oh, don't be rude.

542
00:28:22,566 --> 00:28:26,166
Like that! And then...

543
00:28:29,326 --> 00:28:31,286
Ah...
Ah...

544
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,966
Hey, just so you know,

545
00:28:36,126 --> 00:28:38,966
Cleaver told me about you and Angus.

546
00:28:39,126 --> 00:28:42,246
Oh. Did he?

547
00:28:42,406 --> 00:28:46,446
What exactly did he tell you
about me and Angus?

548
00:28:46,606 --> 00:28:51,686
You two running off to Paris, him
trying to kill himself, Bob Geldof...

549
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:54,846
It must've been around the time
your parents died.

550
00:28:55,006 --> 00:28:57,246
How were they with it?

551
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:03,006
Oh, I mean, they were...

552
00:29:03,166 --> 00:29:05,806
..they were appalled.

553
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:09,166
But you did manage to patch things up
with them before they passed?

554
00:29:09,326 --> 00:29:11,406
Yeah.

555
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:14,406
They weren't the sort
to bear grudges.

556
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,686
Hey, you know
you can tell me anything.

557
00:29:17,846 --> 00:29:21,446
Or nothing. I'm just...I'm here.

558
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:23,086
Hmm?

559
00:29:24,086 --> 00:29:27,406
You finish the coffee.
I'll get the paper.

560
00:29:32,686 --> 00:29:34,006
Hey, Bruce.

561
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:35,686
How are you, Dave?

562
00:29:35,846 --> 00:29:38,166
Good, mate. Good.
No rest for the wicked, eh?

563
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:39,766
Tell me about it.

564
00:29:39,926 --> 00:29:41,806
Well, see ya.

565
00:29:41,966 --> 00:29:44,326
Crisis.
What?

566
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:46,486
I blew it. And there's no more milk.
Oh, bugger.

567
00:29:50,846 --> 00:29:52,486
Hey!
David!

568
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,406
Oh, dear.

569
00:30:16,366 --> 00:30:17,806
Yep.

570
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:19,886
Yep, gotcha.

571
00:30:20,046 --> 00:30:21,366
Thanks, mate.

572
00:30:21,526 --> 00:30:24,366
They picked up
your neighbour's brother.

573
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:26,166
Some sort of family feud.

574
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:27,846
How is he?

575
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:31,246
He was very lucky.
His shoulder's a flesh wound.

576
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:33,446
The other bullet
went through the abdomen.

577
00:30:33,606 --> 00:30:34,926
Oh...
No organs were damaged.

578
00:30:35,086 --> 00:30:36,326
He'll be fine.

579
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:38,166
Oh, thank God.

580
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:42,286
Dad?

581
00:30:42,446 --> 00:30:45,006
Where's the bloody thing?
I had it out this morning.

582
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:47,566
Can't believe you haven't seen this.
Dad.

583
00:30:47,726 --> 00:30:50,606
Ali and Foreman —
the ‘Rumble in the Jungle'.

584
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:55,046
It's human perfection.
I'm seeing someone, Dad.

585
00:30:56,046 --> 00:30:59,766
So she's a girl from your school?

586
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:02,926
And are you doing the...

587
00:31:03,086 --> 00:31:04,486
Mm-hm.

588
00:31:05,606 --> 00:31:07,926
And you're taking precautions?
Yes.

589
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:09,366
OK.

590
00:31:09,526 --> 00:31:10,966
She's in your class?

591
00:31:11,126 --> 00:31:12,726
She's in my class, yeah.

592
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:15,806
OK, I don't see what
the bloody subterfuge is about.

593
00:31:15,966 --> 00:31:19,406
The...girl hasn't told her parents.

594
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:21,326
Won't. Can't.

595
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:25,686
And I know Mum would insist we start
a constructive dialogue with them

596
00:31:25,846 --> 00:31:29,486
and make sure we're all on
the same emotional page.

597
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:32,926
I don't know.
Dad, I'm really into her.

598
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:35,246
Could we come here?

599
00:31:35,406 --> 00:31:36,726
Oh, mate...

600
00:31:36,886 --> 00:31:38,566
I mean, there's nowhere else
for us to go.

601
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:39,566
Oh...

602
00:31:39,726 --> 00:31:42,686
You don't want us paying
for some crappy room in the Cross.

603
00:31:42,846 --> 00:31:46,006
Oh, no, not when you've got
a crappy room in the Cross for free.

604
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:49,286
It'll only be...after school.

605
00:31:49,446 --> 00:31:51,086
Two afternoons a week. Three, max.

606
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:54,806
And you'll be at work anyway, so
you won't even know we've been here.

607
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:58,206
Mate, I'm... Listen, I might have
my own needs with that bed.

608
00:31:58,366 --> 00:32:00,006
I might be in love myself, you know?

609
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:02,486
And I might not want it smelling
of teen spirit.

610
00:32:02,646 --> 00:32:04,566
You're in love too?
Yes, could be.

611
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:06,366
Could very well be.

612
00:32:06,526 --> 00:32:08,886
She's like a mixture
of Mandela and Gandhi

613
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:11,046
and Mother Teresa all rolled into one.

614
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:13,886
Oh, yuck.
But hot.

615
00:32:14,926 --> 00:32:16,246
Hot.

616
00:32:16,406 --> 00:32:19,606
A Sydney barrister
remains in a stable condition

617
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:22,326
after he was shot trying to prevent
an assassination attempt...

618
00:32:23,686 --> 00:32:25,406
..in Sydney's inner west
this afternoon.

619
00:32:25,566 --> 00:32:27,526
David Potter was shot twice

620
00:32:27,686 --> 00:32:31,846
after his neighbour's brother opened
fire outside a Lilyfield home.

621
00:32:32,006 --> 00:32:33,326
Oh.

622
00:32:34,326 --> 00:32:35,606
You're kidding me.

623
00:32:35,766 --> 00:32:37,606
You are kidding me.

624
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:40,366
So the first bullet hits him
and he doesn't even go down.

625
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:41,846
Then the guy's gun jams

626
00:32:42,006 --> 00:32:43,966
and he keeps pointing it at David
and pulling the trigger,

627
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:45,446
but nothing happens.

628
00:32:45,606 --> 00:32:46,966
Oh, thank God for that.

629
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:48,686
If itd been me, I'd have bolted,

630
00:32:48,846 --> 00:32:51,526
but David —
David just charged at him.

631
00:32:51,686 --> 00:32:54,366
It's like...l couldn't
believe my eyes.

632
00:32:54,526 --> 00:32:55,846
Yes, I'll bet. Yeah.

633
00:32:56,006 --> 00:32:58,886
I've never seen courage
like it, Cleave.

634
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:01,686
I mean, nothing in my life
has ever come close.

635
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:04,206
Yeah, well, that sort of behaviour's
instinctive, isn't it?

636
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:05,526
I beg your pardon?

637
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:08,486
Well, I mean, it's not
a conscious decision, is it?

638
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:09,926
It bloody well was.

639
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:12,166
Well, he'd been shot.
He didn't know what he was doing.

640
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:13,646
I'd have done the same.

641
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:15,126
You?!

642
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:19,246
Do you remember the time that
the fire alarm went off in the club?

643
00:33:19,406 --> 00:33:20,966
You were hysterical!

644
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:23,566
I was handcuffed to the bed.

645
00:33:23,726 --> 00:33:25,406
You can't even give him credit

646
00:33:25,566 --> 00:33:29,406
when he gets shot twice
trying to save his neighbour's life!

647
00:33:29,566 --> 00:33:32,166
Yeah, well, frankly, it doesn't
sound like he was in that much danger.

648
00:33:32,326 --> 00:33:34,366
I mean, four shots off,
no fatalities

649
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:36,126
and...and nobody even
on the critical list.

650
00:33:36,286 --> 00:33:37,646
It's not exactly Mossad, is it?

651
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:39,086
You're impossible.

652
00:33:39,246 --> 00:33:41,726
Oh, and by the way, thanks
for the details about me and Angus.

653
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,846
Oh, as if I was gonna let that
go through to the keeper.

654
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:48,606
Oh, shit.

655
00:33:48,766 --> 00:33:49,766
Problem?

656
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:53,046
Oh, I was supposed to meet
Mother Teresa for a drink.

657
00:33:54,046 --> 00:33:54,966
Go.

658
00:33:55,126 --> 00:33:57,286
I can amuse myself
until Mum comes back.

659
00:33:57,446 --> 00:33:58,926
Are you sure?

660
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:07,086
What's wrong?

661
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:09,686
Hmm. Hey, baby?
Mmm.

662
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:12,086
Hmm, Cleaver. What is it?

663
00:34:12,246 --> 00:34:13,566
Nothing.
What's wrong?

664
00:34:13,726 --> 00:34:17,806
Oh...this guy I know got shot.

665
00:34:17,966 --> 00:34:19,806
Who?

666
00:34:19,966 --> 00:34:21,406
Oh, not the hero lawyer guy?

667
00:34:21,566 --> 00:34:24,286
Yes, the hero lawyer guy.
Oh, is he a friend of yours?

668
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:27,886
No, he's not a friend of mine.
And he's not a fucking hero, alright?

669
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:29,606
He's a tax lawyer.
Oh.

670
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:33,806
Now he's been shot, everybody thinks
he's Jesus F. bloody Kennedy.

671
00:34:33,966 --> 00:34:37,646
He's not a hero. You're a hero.

672
00:34:37,806 --> 00:34:39,926
Really?
Yeah.

673
00:34:40,086 --> 00:34:43,566
You're my hero.
Really?

674
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:47,286
Mmm.
Mmm.

675
00:34:51,046 --> 00:34:52,486
Er... Ooh?

676
00:34:52,646 --> 00:34:54,766
Wha... Oh, what the hell is that?!

677
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,526
What?
Oh, God!

678
00:34:56,686 --> 00:34:59,446
Oh. Oh, that would be my son's.

679
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:02,166
Oh, I thought
I could smell teenager.

680
00:35:02,326 --> 00:35:04,926
I know. It's revolting, isn't it?
Oh.

681
00:35:05,086 --> 00:35:06,766
Um...anyway.

682
00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:10,806
We shouldn't let that
interrupt our conference.

683
00:35:10,966 --> 00:35:13,246
Our conference?
Us doing it is a conference?

684
00:35:13,406 --> 00:35:15,046
Well, for billing purposes.

685
00:35:15,206 --> 00:35:17,366
You don't want me doing
any real prep, do you?

686
00:35:17,526 --> 00:35:19,766
You might stand a chance of winning.

687
00:35:21,006 --> 00:35:23,526
Mmm.

688
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:25,126
So what can I do for you, Cleave?

689
00:35:25,286 --> 00:35:26,806
Who's Katrina Ryan?

690
00:35:26,966 --> 00:35:29,846
Um, oh, I can remember
hearing something about her.

691
00:35:30,006 --> 00:35:31,886
What, is she against you in Marx?
Yeah.

692
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,486
She is, as a matter of fact.

693
00:35:33,646 --> 00:35:35,526
You know she's only two years
out of law school?

694
00:35:35,686 --> 00:35:37,006
Is she?
Yeah.

695
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,046
No, I heard
she's a bit of a young gun.

696
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:41,246
I hear she needs a bullet.

697
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:42,726
No, nothing to do with me, mate.

698
00:35:42,886 --> 00:35:44,966
It's the DPP's call.
I guess you guys just got lucky.

699
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:47,086
Any word on the judge?

700
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,086
Er, yeah.

701
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:51,086
Yeah, er, Jessica Mason.

702
00:35:51,246 --> 00:35:53,726
Jess Mason? You're kidding me.

703
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:55,926
No. No, that's what I've been told.

704
00:35:56,086 --> 00:35:57,446
Right.

705
00:35:57,606 --> 00:35:59,126
Single mother with four daughters,

706
00:35:59,286 --> 00:36:02,606
one of whom lost a leg
in that ferry disaster last year.

707
00:36:02,766 --> 00:36:04,286
Yeah. Yeah, that was a tragedy.

708
00:36:04,446 --> 00:36:07,166
Joe, what's going on?

709
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,766
No idea what you're talking about.

710
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:11,846
Well, I got Julie Andrews for a judge

711
00:36:12,006 --> 00:36:13,566
and Shirley Temple
for the prosecution.

712
00:36:13,726 --> 00:36:16,286
Yeah, mate, I've told you.
Nothing to do with me.

713
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:18,806
Ooh, mate, I've gotta go.

714
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:21,966
I'd, er, I'd wish you luck, Cleave.
I'm not sure you need it.

715
00:36:24,006 --> 00:36:27,486
The bastards are throwing it.
They want her to walk free.

716
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:30,006
I heard about Katrina Ryan.

717
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:33,086
Yeah, it gets better.
We're gonna be before Jess Mason.

718
00:36:33,246 --> 00:36:35,046
Oh, she's not gonna
send Lucy to jail.

719
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:36,766
She'll give her a bloody medal.

720
00:36:36,926 --> 00:36:41,166
I know. So I've gotta figure out
some way to piss her off.

721
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,646
Her and the jury.

722
00:36:42,806 --> 00:36:44,686
Oh, well, it's never been
a problem for you before.

723
00:36:44,846 --> 00:36:47,366
You wanna have lunch?
I can't, mate.

724
00:36:47,526 --> 00:36:48,966
I'm having lunch
with Dennis the Menace.

725
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:49,966
Why?

726
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:52,966
He defended Tanisha. He said
he's happy to have a quiet word.

727
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:55,046
The more we know...

728
00:36:57,086 --> 00:36:58,806
Well, it was bloody weird.

729
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,806
Here was their star fullback
stabbed to death

730
00:37:00,966 --> 00:37:02,726
and none of his teammates
would talk about it,

731
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:04,606
not even to the prosecution.

732
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,006
None of 'em had a clue, apparently.

733
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,526
‘Don't know anything,
barely knew her,

734
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,966
“Gav was a good bloke,
kept to himself.”

735
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:14,766
They have anything to say
about Tanisha?

736
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:16,366
No.

737
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:20,166
But, you know, but I could tell
she was not well liked.

738
00:37:20,326 --> 00:37:21,646
Every time I mentioned her name,

739
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,406
the room got a little chillier.

740
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:24,926
Doesn't make her guilty.

741
00:37:28,686 --> 00:37:30,726
- Here she comes!
- Ms Marx...

742
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:35,766
Will you go to jail?

743
00:37:38,446 --> 00:37:40,126
Um...yes, Your Honour.

744
00:37:40,286 --> 00:37:41,646
What w-we have...

745
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:44,006
What we have...the...

746
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:47,246
..the case, er, before Your Honour
is one of grave...greatness.

747
00:37:47,406 --> 00:37:49,406
Great gravity.

748
00:37:49,566 --> 00:37:52,246
Um...the relevant section...

749
00:37:52,406 --> 00:37:53,726
IS...

750
00:37:53,886 --> 00:37:55,966
Oh, sorry. Sorry.
If Your Honour will bear with me...

751
00:37:56,126 --> 00:37:57,886
68a.

752
00:37:58,046 --> 00:38:00,766
Thanks. Section 68a, er...

753
00:38:00,926 --> 00:38:02,366
Here it is.

754
00:38:02,526 --> 00:38:06,006
Your Honour, could I request
a brief adjournment

755
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,366
while I confer with my client?

756
00:38:08,526 --> 00:38:10,006
Certainly, Mr Greene.

757
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:12,126
All rise.

758
00:38:19,846 --> 00:38:21,886
Ms Ryan, may I have a word?

759
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:23,686
Oh, Mr Greene. Hello.

760
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:25,886
Thank you, by the way.
That was...very kind.

761
00:38:26,046 --> 00:38:28,166
Oh, what are learned friends for?

762
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:31,166
You seem a little flustered.

763
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:34,406
Was it noticeable?
Only to the highly trained eye.

764
00:38:34,566 --> 00:38:36,006
It's...it's my first big trial.

765
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:38,966
I... To be frank, I was rather
surprised when they briefed me.

766
00:38:39,126 --> 00:38:42,766
I remember my first big trial.
I was throwing up all day.

767
00:38:42,926 --> 00:38:46,646
Sowas I. I, um...
..still am, in fact.

768
00:38:47,886 --> 00:38:49,606
Have you heard of beta blockers?

769
00:38:49,766 --> 00:38:51,606
Um, I think so.

770
00:38:51,766 --> 00:38:55,006
They take away
that performance anxiety.

771
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,606
Oh, really?
Mmm.

772
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:59,486
Look, I happen to have
a couple on me.

773
00:38:59,646 --> 00:39:01,006
That's so kind of you. Thank you.

774
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:02,726
Keep the pack.

775
00:39:02,886 --> 00:39:05,886
But don't you need them?
Oh, probably not today.

776
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:08,846
Your Honour, as I was saying before
Mr Greene requested the recess,

777
00:39:09,006 --> 00:39:13,126
offences under the ‘Jury Act'
represent a most grave threat

778
00:39:13,286 --> 00:39:14,606
to our system of justice.

779
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:18,526
Jurors must feel safe and free
in their decision taking.

780
00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:20,526
Not just before, not just during,

781
00:39:20,686 --> 00:39:23,126
but also subsequent
to their verdict.

782
00:39:23,286 --> 00:39:26,646
What the hell?
She's...she's good!

783
00:39:26,806 --> 00:39:28,846
What can I say?

784
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,566
Women.

785
00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:35,006
They're such flighty things,
aren't they?

786
00:39:36,766 --> 00:39:40,286
Erratic. Unpredictable.

787
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:43,326
Quick to respond to sudden impulses.

788
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:48,406
Laughing one minute,
crying bloody murder the next,

789
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:50,246
and not just
when they have their periods.

790
00:39:50,406 --> 00:39:52,886
Mr Greene, may I ask
where this is leading?

791
00:39:53,046 --> 00:39:55,366
Your Honour, my client is a woman.

792
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,166
We are aware of that fact,
Mr Greene.

793
00:39:57,326 --> 00:40:00,766
And she's not just
a woman, Your Honour.

794
00:40:00,926 --> 00:40:02,526
She's a mother.

795
00:40:02,686 --> 00:40:04,486
Go on.

796
00:40:04,646 --> 00:40:06,366
Thank you.

797
00:40:07,486 --> 00:40:09,526
A mother's greatest boast

798
00:40:09,686 --> 00:40:12,286
is that she will go
to extraordinary lengths

799
00:40:12,446 --> 00:40:14,846
to defend and protect her children.

800
00:40:16,566 --> 00:40:21,126
Tanisha Marx was born
as the result of a one-night stand

801
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:26,206
that Lucy had in Auckland,
some 19 years ago.

802
00:40:26,366 --> 00:40:27,686
Er, the father...

803
00:40:27,846 --> 00:40:30,406
..to this day is blissfully ignorant

804
00:40:30,566 --> 00:40:32,726
of the fact
that he even has a daughter.

805
00:40:32,886 --> 00:40:35,046
The fact that Lucy Marx

806
00:40:35,206 --> 00:40:38,166
had a lot of sexual partners
when she was young

807
00:40:38,326 --> 00:40:41,126
has absolutely no bearing
on this case,

808
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:43,286
and you must disregard that fact.

809
00:40:43,446 --> 00:40:47,166
You must also disregard the fact

810
00:40:47,326 --> 00:40:52,486
that Ms Marx is still clearly
prepared to sleep with anyone.

811
00:40:53,726 --> 00:40:56,766
If that's what it takes
for her to pursue her quest

812
00:40:56,926 --> 00:41:00,326
for justice and vengeance.

813
00:41:00,486 --> 00:41:05,126
However much that quest
may seem to conflict

814
00:41:05,286 --> 00:41:09,526
with the so-called laws
that govern this State.

815
00:41:11,606 --> 00:41:13,086
Thank you, Your Honour.

816
00:41:16,526 --> 00:41:18,126
He didn't!

817
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:20,606
He didn't?

818
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:24,606
That conniving bastard!

819
00:41:24,766 --> 00:41:26,606
He's gone totally Broken Arrow
on us, boss.

820
00:41:26,766 --> 00:41:28,806
Oh, shitty shit!

821
00:41:29,886 --> 00:41:31,566
Fuck's sake!

822
00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:35,486
In all my years,
I have never seen such a display.

823
00:41:35,646 --> 00:41:37,766
Such wilful negligence.

824
00:41:37,926 --> 00:41:40,806
Your opening was 100 times more
damaging to your client's case

825
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:42,286
than Ms Ryan's.

826
00:41:42,446 --> 00:41:44,766
Er, well, I'm saddened
Your Honour feels that way.

827
00:41:44,926 --> 00:41:49,166
Er, it was a strategy devised
in full consultation with my client.

828
00:41:49,326 --> 00:41:50,926
Come.

829
00:41:52,526 --> 00:41:53,846
Your Honour.

830
00:41:54,006 --> 00:41:56,086
Have you sought further
instructions, Mr Meagher?

831
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:57,566
I have, Your Honour.

832
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:59,366
And Ms Marx is perfectly happy

833
00:41:59,526 --> 00:42:02,086
with the way Mr Greene
is conducting this case.

834
00:42:02,246 --> 00:42:05,006
Alright, you two,
what's going on here?

835
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:06,886
Whatever do you mean, Your Honour?

836
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:09,686
I mean I am this fucking close

837
00:42:09,846 --> 00:42:12,646
to referring your conduct
to the Bar Association.

838
00:42:13,806 --> 00:42:15,966
Were you aware
of the existence of the ‘Jury Act'

839
00:42:16,126 --> 00:42:18,206
before contriving
to meet Mr Daniels at Chasers?

840
00:42:18,366 --> 00:42:20,566
I most certainly was.
Oh.

841
00:42:20,726 --> 00:42:22,406
W-were you aware

842
00:42:22,566 --> 00:42:25,046
that seeking information
about a jury's deliberations,

843
00:42:25,206 --> 00:42:27,366
even after a sentence
has been passed, was a crime?

844
00:42:27,526 --> 00:42:31,406
A crime subject to the maximum
of seven years in prison? Yes.

845
00:42:31,566 --> 00:42:33,486
Um...right.

846
00:42:33,646 --> 00:42:37,166
Er...

847
00:42:37,326 --> 00:42:42,126
Well, er, then...no further
questions, Your Honour.

848
00:42:43,126 --> 00:42:44,926
Anything further, Mr Greene?

849
00:42:45,086 --> 00:42:46,526
Nothing further,
thank you, Your Honour.

850
00:42:46,686 --> 00:42:48,686
Are you sure of that?

851
00:42:48,846 --> 00:42:50,966
Quite sure. Thank you, Your Honour.

852
00:42:51,126 --> 00:42:52,446
We'll resume in the morning.

853
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:54,366
All rise.

854
00:42:56,686 --> 00:42:59,206
I know the single mother's
about to have your balls on a plate.

855
00:42:59,366 --> 00:43:00,686
Short-term tactical necessity.

856
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:02,886
Long-term testicular catastrophe.

857
00:43:03,046 --> 00:43:04,926
Thought the conduct committee
made it pretty clear last time

858
00:43:05,086 --> 00:43:06,406
they didn't wanna see you
ever again.

859
00:43:06,566 --> 00:43:07,886
Ah, bunch of pussies.

860
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:09,726
Bunch of pussies who
could have you struck off.

861
00:43:09,886 --> 00:43:12,486
Mate, we've got a client who's prepared
to go to jail on a matter of principle.

862
00:43:12,646 --> 00:43:15,846
What sort of dipshit would I be to be
worried about the conduct committee?

863
00:43:16,006 --> 00:43:17,606
What about Mick and Vanessa's
repayment plan?

864
00:43:17,766 --> 00:43:19,606
Oh, you really are
Captain Buzzkill, aren't you?

865
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,086
What if Tanisha's guilty?

866
00:43:21,246 --> 00:43:25,246
Barnyard, I'm a big boy.
I know what I'm doing.

867
00:43:38,806 --> 00:43:40,526
Michael Warner?
Yeah.

868
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:43,566
Are you Gav Warner's cousin?
Yeah.

869
00:43:43,726 --> 00:43:45,126
So you think Tanisha will get out?

870
00:43:45,286 --> 00:43:47,406
There's a chance.

871
00:43:47,566 --> 00:43:50,766
There's a lot of political pressure.
It's an election year.

872
00:43:50,926 --> 00:43:54,486
And she's pretty — the public
always forgives the pretty ones.

873
00:43:55,966 --> 00:44:00,046
Look, mate, I just need to know
what happened.

874
00:44:00,206 --> 00:44:04,406
So we can do the right thing.
We wanna do the right thing.

875
00:44:04,566 --> 00:44:06,766
Your name will never be mentioned.

876
00:44:07,926 --> 00:44:10,086
Is it true
that you told the jury foreman

877
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:12,366
that Tanisha was a bitch
and that she killed your cousin?

878
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:15,806
Mmm.
You had information?

879
00:44:15,966 --> 00:44:17,766
But you didn't give it to the police?

880
00:44:17,926 --> 00:44:19,566
I wanted to tell the cops
what really happened.

881
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:21,526
But no-one would back me up.

882
00:44:21,686 --> 00:44:23,446
They said it'd be my word
against theirs

883
00:44:23,606 --> 00:44:25,046
and if it came down to it

884
00:44:25,206 --> 00:44:27,726
they'd say I was the one
she was rooting out of school.

885
00:44:27,886 --> 00:44:30,766
Who's ‘they'?
Oh, his...his teammates.

886
00:44:30,926 --> 00:44:33,326
Tanisha was having an affair
with one of Gav's teammates?

887
00:44:33,486 --> 00:44:37,286
No. She was having an affair
with his coach.

888
00:44:37,446 --> 00:44:40,486
You know, he's married, Catholic,

889
00:44:40,646 --> 00:44:43,286
father of six kids,
eight premierships.

890
00:44:43,446 --> 00:44:45,726
Purer-than-pure supercoach.

891
00:44:45,886 --> 00:44:47,966
Clive Booth?
Yeah.

892
00:44:48,126 --> 00:44:50,406
Are you sure?
Yeah.

893
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:52,046
Yeah, Gav told me.

894
00:44:52,206 --> 00:44:53,726
You know, he couldn't do anything
about it, though.

895
00:44:53,886 --> 00:44:56,366
Clive Booth was a god to him.
He's a god to everyone.

896
00:44:57,526 --> 00:45:00,046
Alright, the night he died,
Gav rang me and told me

897
00:45:00,206 --> 00:45:01,646
he was gonna confront her about it.

898
00:45:01,806 --> 00:45:03,566
And you think that Booth was there?

899
00:45:03,726 --> 00:45:05,246
Well, not if
the time of death's right.

900
00:45:05,406 --> 00:45:06,966
He was giving a speech
halfway across town.

901
00:45:07,126 --> 00:45:09,766
But I'll bet you he helped her
get rid of the body.

902
00:45:11,406 --> 00:45:13,086
When did Clive Booth die, again?

903
00:45:13,246 --> 00:45:14,606
Er, four months after Gav.

904
00:45:14,766 --> 00:45:17,486
Yeah, a heart attack, right?
Yeah.

905
00:45:20,286 --> 00:45:23,446
Come up.
Is Lucy upstairs?

906
00:45:23,606 --> 00:45:25,606
Yeah, but she's cool.

907
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:30,086
Tanisha did it.
Oh, not this shit again.

908
00:45:30,246 --> 00:45:31,486
Yeah, this shit again.

909
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,126
Barnyard, you can't possibly know
she did it.

910
00:45:34,286 --> 00:45:37,686
Yeah, I can. I just spent two hours
with Gav Warner's cousin.

911
00:45:37,846 --> 00:45:40,726
The cousin. Well, he was part of
the problem in the first place.

912
00:45:40,886 --> 00:45:42,926
Clive Booth was the problem, mate.

913
00:45:43,086 --> 00:45:44,966
Tanisha was having
an affair with him.

914
00:45:45,126 --> 00:45:47,126
Gav found out
and threatened to go public.

915
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,806
It's the only way
it makes sense, Cleave.

916
00:45:49,966 --> 00:45:51,886
Everything that Dennis said,
the DPP...

917
00:45:52,046 --> 00:45:52,886
Mate.

918
00:45:53,046 --> 00:45:56,766
This is me talking, mate.
She's using you.

919
00:45:57,886 --> 00:45:58,886
No.

920
00:46:12,846 --> 00:46:14,326
What did he want?

921
00:46:15,326 --> 00:46:20,326
Nothing important. He's, er,
just having a few problems at home.

922
00:46:22,406 --> 00:46:22,486
I didn't wanna talk about the trial,

923
00:46:22,486 --> 00:46:23,966
I didn't wanna talk about the trial,

924
00:46:24,126 --> 00:46:25,526
what happened in the jury room.

925
00:46:25,686 --> 00:46:27,246
None of it.

926
00:46:27,406 --> 00:46:30,526
She made me talk about it.

927
00:46:30,686 --> 00:46:32,446
I feel violated.

928
00:46:34,126 --> 00:46:37,126
Mr Daniels, what was Ms Marx doing

929
00:46:37,286 --> 00:46:39,726
while you were having
this conversation?

930
00:46:40,726 --> 00:46:42,726
She was...

931
00:46:44,086 --> 00:46:45,646
..going down on me.

932
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:47,926
I beg your pardon?

933
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,006
She was going down on me.

934
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:54,646
Going down on you.

935
00:46:54,806 --> 00:46:58,286
By which you mean
she was performing oral sex on you?

936
00:46:58,446 --> 00:46:59,726
Yes.

937
00:46:59,886 --> 00:47:03,766
That's how she compelled you
to break your oath to the court?

938
00:47:06,006 --> 00:47:10,326
Mr Daniels, you're 28 years old,
is that correct?

939
00:47:10,486 --> 00:47:11,326
Yes.

940
00:47:11,486 --> 00:47:15,486
Ms Marx is 38 years old. Do you
prefer the company of older women?

941
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:20,206
Um, I don't know.
She was nice-looking.

942
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:22,486
I put it to you, Mr Daniels,

943
00:47:22,646 --> 00:47:27,046
that it was you who was seeking
to take advantage that evening.

944
00:47:27,206 --> 00:47:31,086
Advantage of a lonely,
vulnerable woman.

945
00:47:31,246 --> 00:47:32,326
No.

946
00:47:32,486 --> 00:47:34,006
I see.

947
00:47:36,966 --> 00:47:40,366
How much did the ‘Tele'
pay you for your story?

948
00:47:43,286 --> 00:47:45,726
How much, Mr Daniels?

949
00:47:45,886 --> 00:47:47,766
20 grand.

950
00:47:47,926 --> 00:47:52,206
So you got a slap-up meal,
oral sex and 20 grand,

951
00:47:52,366 --> 00:47:54,326
and still you feel violated?

952
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:59,686
Some people are very hard to satisfy,
Mr Daniels.

953
00:48:02,566 --> 00:48:04,606
What was that?!

954
00:48:04,766 --> 00:48:08,286
Since when was attacking
Marty Daniels part of the plan?

955
00:48:08,446 --> 00:48:11,046
For a moment there, it sounded like
you wanted to nail him!

956
00:48:11,206 --> 00:48:13,566
Sorry. Old habits.

957
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:18,166
I am not happy
about what happened in there.

958
00:48:20,326 --> 00:48:23,646
You were a part of Tanisha's alibi,
weren't you?

959
00:48:23,806 --> 00:48:25,166
Yes.

960
00:48:25,326 --> 00:48:28,566
You told the trial
that on the night Gavin died

961
00:48:28,726 --> 00:48:32,526
you had a phone call from Tanisha
and you chatted for a few moments,

962
00:48:32,686 --> 00:48:34,006
you said she sounded fine.

963
00:48:34,166 --> 00:48:37,686
Yes. Her phone records
bore that out.

964
00:48:37,846 --> 00:48:39,446
Why do you ask?

965
00:48:40,446 --> 00:48:42,806
Because your phone records
also bear out the fact

966
00:48:42,966 --> 00:48:46,366
that you made another call
after you hung up from Tanisha.

967
00:48:46,526 --> 00:48:49,886
You called Clive Booth.

968
00:48:50,046 --> 00:48:52,886
I'm presuming you told him
to go over to Tanisha's place

969
00:48:53,046 --> 00:48:54,846
and help her dispose of the body?

970
00:48:55,846 --> 00:48:58,406
You blackmailing him...

971
00:48:59,406 --> 00:49:02,006
..sort of your M.O., isn't it?

972
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:03,926
Signature dish.

973
00:49:04,086 --> 00:49:08,086
I did what any mother would do.

974
00:49:09,126 --> 00:49:10,646
Not my mum.

975
00:49:13,246 --> 00:49:15,806
I can't represent you anymore, Lucy.

976
00:49:17,086 --> 00:49:20,846
I was only prepared to put you
in jail when you weren't guilty.

977
00:49:21,006 --> 00:49:24,646
That is going to have consequences.

978
00:49:24,806 --> 00:49:26,446
Everything does.

979
00:49:27,526 --> 00:49:29,286
I really liked her.

980
00:49:31,646 --> 00:49:33,926
It was weird, she reminded me
of you somehow.

981
00:49:34,086 --> 00:49:36,846
How did that make you feel?

982
00:49:38,086 --> 00:49:40,286
Strangely comforted.
Hmm.

983
00:49:42,086 --> 00:49:44,766
I had this fantasy

984
00:49:44,926 --> 00:49:48,446
about coming around here
one time with Lucy and...

985
00:49:48,606 --> 00:49:50,326
And, what, we'd end up
jelly wrestling?

986
00:49:50,486 --> 00:49:53,086
Oh, well, I hadn't thought of that.
But now that you mention it...

987
00:49:55,446 --> 00:49:58,286
So. Did she displace
your feelings for Melissa?

988
00:49:59,326 --> 00:50:01,926
What does that matter?
Answer the question.

989
00:50:02,926 --> 00:50:05,926
Oh, come on, darling. You know me.

990
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:10,046
My feelings never get displaced,
they just get added to.

991
00:50:10,206 --> 00:50:13,886
I still love everyone
I've ever loved —

992
00:50:14,046 --> 00:50:17,086
you, Missy,

993
00:50:17,246 --> 00:50:20,366
Miss Harbright
my fourth grade teacher.

994
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:24,486
And?

995
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:30,846
After Judge Jessica Mason
ruled a mistrial,

996
00:50:31,006 --> 00:50:33,806
she referred Lucy Marx's counsel
Cleaver Greene

997
00:50:33,966 --> 00:50:37,366
to the Professional Conduct
Committee of the Bar Council.

998
00:50:37,526 --> 00:50:39,246
The Bar Association.

999
00:50:39,406 --> 00:50:41,406
..sent shock waves
through Sydney's legal community.

1000
00:50:41,566 --> 00:50:44,086
Well, Cleaver Greene was
not only negligent at my trial...

1001
00:50:44,246 --> 00:50:45,566
Oh, hello.

1002
00:50:45,726 --> 00:50:49,366
At possibly the most vulnerable time
of my life,

1003
00:50:49,526 --> 00:50:51,366
he seduced me

1004
00:50:51,526 --> 00:50:54,326
and for most of the last week
before my trial,

1005
00:50:54,486 --> 00:50:56,486
we were having sexual intercourse.

1006
00:50:56,646 --> 00:50:58,486
Oh, yes.

1007
00:50:58,646 --> 00:51:01,286
He did almost no work.
He even bragged about it.

1008
00:51:01,446 --> 00:51:05,126
We shouldn't let
that interrupt our conference.

1009
00:51:05,286 --> 00:51:07,806
Our conference?
Us doing it is a conference?

1010
00:51:07,966 --> 00:51:09,686
Well, for billing purposes.

1011
00:51:09,846 --> 00:51:12,046
You don't want me
doing any real prep, do you?

1012
00:51:12,206 --> 00:51:14,206
We might stand a chance of winning.

1013
00:51:31,726 --> 00:51:34,006
I heard the news.

1014
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:36,126
Are you OK?

1015
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:38,150
