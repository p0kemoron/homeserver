1
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,560
Namibia,

2
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,080
Southern Africa.

3
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,640
A vast, dried-up lakebed...

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,840
...where temperatures can reach

5
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,120
almost 50 degrees Celsius.

6
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,320
DISTANT BRAYING

7
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,800
Overheating

8
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,680
is dangerous for all.

9
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,720
Nonetheless,
in this cauldron of heat...

10
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,880
...mammals have found
a way to survive.

11
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,920
Across the planet,

12
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,120
{\an8}mammals have learnt
how to deal with heat...

13
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,400
...in the most remarkable ways.

14
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,520
The Serra da Capivara in Brazil.

15
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,720
A world of harsh, dry forest...

16
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,320
...and scorched cliff faces.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,760
Here, the dry season lasts

18
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,760
for up to seven months.

19
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,000
And what little rain that falls

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,760
quickly disappears.

21
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,680
Despite this,

22
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,040
one mammal has made it home.

23
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,400
A family of bearded capuchins.

24
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,200
They have spent the night

25
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,320
high up on the cliff faces,

26
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,280
safe from any predators below.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,400
It may be early,

28
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,320
but already temperatures
are beginning to soar.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,080
The troop

30
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
needs to find water.

31
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,840
And none need it more

32
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,000
than a mother.

33
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,680
Without it,

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,760
she won't be able
to produce the milk

35
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,600
essential for her young baby.

36
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,200
But first, they must make
the treacherous journey

37
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,240
down to the forest floor.

38
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,840
The newborn must hold on tight.

39
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,160
Others forge ahead.

40
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,240
For the first
to reach the forest floor...

41
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,400
...the last few cashew fruit

42
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,280
provide some welcome sustenance.

43
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,360
But there's not enough
to go around.

44
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,200
Mother and baby must go without.

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,800
At nearly 40 degrees,

46
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,200
the heat is relentless.

47
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,640
Desperate,

48
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,520
the troop look for anything

49
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,360
that might contain water.

50
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,760
Could the trees
provide the solution?

51
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,120
Hidden in some trunks,

52
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,400
there is a little water,

53
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,800
left over from the last rains.

54
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,360
But reaching it

55
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,520
is a real monkey puzzle.

56
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,360
Mammals, however,

57
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,240
are experts at solving problems.

58
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,640
An older male
tries a different approach.

59
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,520
Perhaps a bit more brains

60
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,280
and a little less brawn.

61
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,840
A stick produces
a dribble of success.

62
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,800
Having watched all the others try,

63
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,520
the mother finally gets her turn.

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,080
WATER SLOSHES

65
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,560
Her tail acts like a sponge...

66
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,080
...soaking up any water

67
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,000
that has collected in the trunk.

68
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,200
Being able to tap
these hidden wells

69
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
is more than just a clever trick.

70
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,680
It's a life-saving lesson...

71
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,440
...and one the rest of her family
quickly learn.

72
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,920
Their ability
to solve such problems

73
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,240
will help the troop survive

74
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,200
these long, hot, dry months.

75
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,600
And, finally, the newborn

76
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,240
can get a much-needed
drink of its own.

77
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,000
But there are places

78
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,960
that are even hotter and even drier.

79
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,080
Australia -

80
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,200
the driest inhabited
continent on Earth,

81
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,240
with almost a million
square miles of desert.

82
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,480
A furnace where water
is almost impossible to find.

83
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,920
An Arabian camel.

84
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,920
Introduced in the 1800s
by early explorers,

85
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,920
it's estimated
that as many as one million

86
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,720
now roam the outback.

87
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,520
For this lone male
in search of a mate,

88
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,200
desert plants

89
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,720
provide a few slim pickings.

90
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,680
Any surplus nutrients

91
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,920
can be stored
in his most famous feature...

92
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,440
...his hump.

93
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,440
Full of fat,

94
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,520
it's a built-in energy store

95
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,560
that can be tapped when needed.

96
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,720
And as long as he can find food,

97
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,040
he can go without
drinking for months.

98
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,560
At last,

99
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,560
what he's been looking for.

100
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,200
GRUNTING

101
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,680
A herd of females.

102
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,400
It's important

103
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,640
that he makes
a good first impression.

104
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,040
GURGLING BELLOW

105
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,720
And he has a special way
of doing so...

106
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,920
...with a dulla.

107
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,760
GURGLING

108
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,000
BELLOWING

109
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,360
This inflatable sac

110
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,600
is unique to camels,

111
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,360
and accompanied by loud gurgling...

112
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,520
GURGLING

113
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,160
...is his way of attracting females.

114
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,440
Has he done enough to impress?

115
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,240
GRUNTING

116
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,640
Apparently not.

117
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,920
A raised tail
is a polite way of saying,

118
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,400
"No, thank you."

119
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,680
Not so easy after all.

120
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,400
Could she be the one?

121
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,040
GRUNTING

122
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,360
BELLOWING

123
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,840
Looking good!

124
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,920
BELLOWING

125
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Bad luck, Romeo.

126
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,040
GURGLING

127
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,240
Despite his best efforts,

128
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,400
it's not been his day.

129
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,000
Camels have overcome

130
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,600
the desert's greatest test -

131
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,120
its lack of water.

132
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,000
{\an8}But this is not the only challenge

133
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,320
{\an8}faced by mammals

134
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,720
{\an8}in hot and arid conditions.

135
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,480
{\an8}Just as dangerous

136
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,000
{\an8}is the risk of overheating.

137
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,840
Sifaka lemurs...

138
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,240
...in one of the hottest

139
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,000
and driest places in Madagascar.

140
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,600
The trees provide some shade...

141
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,480
...and a little relief
from the burning sun.

142
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,320
But with midday temperatures

143
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,880
that can exceed 45 degrees...

144
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,800
...the heat up here
soon becomes unbearable...

145
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,080
...especially for the babies...

146
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,800
...the most vulnerable
members of the group.

147
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,640
But sifaka

148
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,560
have an unusual and clever way

149
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,000
to cool down...

150
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,360
{\an8}...if only they can
find the right tree.

151
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,080
And once they have...

152
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,880
...they hug it.

153
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,040
The Salvadora tree

154
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,080
is one of their favourites.

155
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,280
These trees draw up cool water

156
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,920
from deep below ground...

157
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,360
...so their trunks
are a few degrees cooler

158
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,200
than everything else around.

159
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,320
At the hottest time of day,

160
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,880
some embraces
can last for over four hours.

161
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,920
And some trees are so popular...

162
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,360
...there isn't an inch to spare.

163
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
This remarkable behaviour

164
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,080
was first recorded
by scientists in 2017.

165
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,080
As the world becomes hotter,

166
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,000
we may see cooling
behaviours like this

167
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,240
become more and more common.

168
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,880
But some sifakas
have gone one stage further.

169
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,000
They know the best place

170
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,520
is within the trunk

171
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,480
of the Salvadora tree.

172
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,640
Here, the temperature
can be even cooler.

173
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,400
And that can give real respite

174
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,640
from the oven outside.

175
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,040
Sifakas have learnt
that tree-hugging

176
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,120
is an effective way to keep cool.

177
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,240
But some mammals

178
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,160
face a far more dangerous
source of heat than the sun.

179
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,400
The dry eucalyptus forests
of Australia.

180
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,320
Home to one of the most
bizarre of all mammals.

181
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,400
An echidna.

182
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,640
It's one of the most
ancient of mammals

183
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,520
and reproduces

184
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,240
by laying eggs.

185
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,240
SNIFFING

186
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,480
She's out foraging,

187
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,040
using her highly sensitive nose

188
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,360
to look for ants and termites.

189
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,040
To work at its best,

190
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,240
her nose has to be kept moist.

191
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,600
And this has led her

192
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,760
to developing an unusual skill.

193
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,240
She blows snot bubbles.

194
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,760
As the moisture evaporates,

195
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
it helps to cool her down.

196
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,000
But this female is not alone.

197
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,000
She can be followed

198
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,640
by up to ten or more males...

199
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,480
...all vying for her attention.

200
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,720
It's what is known

201
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,000
as a love train.

202
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,040
And it can run for weeks.

203
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,520
One male has managed to get close.

204
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,000
With such a prickly partner,

205
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,520
a gentle touch is needed.

206
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,720
But some romantic liaisons

207
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,080
don't last long.

208
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,280
With their sensitive noses,

209
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,520
echidnas can detect

210
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,880
the early signs of danger.

211
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,600
A bushfire.

212
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,400
Their best chance of safety

213
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,560
{\an8}is to get underground.

214
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,600
Echidnas often go underground

215
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,360
to avoid the severe heat of the day.

216
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,960
But they also have to do so

217
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,040
to escape the heat of a bushfire.

218
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Between 2019 and 2020,

219
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,080
Australia experienced

220
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,800
its most catastrophic
bushfire season on record.

221
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,720
Over 100,000 square miles,

222
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,680
an area larger
than the United Kingdom,

223
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,160
was devastated.

224
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,760
But in such dangerous conditions,

225
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,400
echidna have
a remarkable survival skill.

226
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,600
They go into a deep sleep

227
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,000
known as a torpor.

228
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,800
It's a form of hibernation,

229
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
during which their heart rate

230
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,400
may slow to only
four beats a minute.

231
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,040
Their core body temperature drops.

232
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,640
And they may only take a breath

233
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,680
once every three minutes.

234
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,360
By doing this,

235
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,480
they can live for days
without food or water.

236
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,280
After the fire has passed...

237
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,280
...the echidnas begin to emerge.

238
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,560
Not all are unscathed.

239
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,520
Melted spines

240
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,000
show that this one

241
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,880
has had a close call.

242
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,800
But others

243
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
show no ill effects.

244
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,600
Their unique adaptations

245
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,080
have kept them safe.

246
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,120
But as global temperatures rise,

247
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,960
forest fires
are becoming more intense...

248
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,560
...and more frequent.

249
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,640
The survival skills of echidnas

250
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,840
will become even more crucial.

251
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,560
Going underground to avoid the heat

252
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,600
makes obvious sense,

253
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,800
but one mammal

254
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,560
does the exact opposite.

255
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,480
Harris's antelope squirrel.

256
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,160
Even during the height of summer,

257
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,640
when ground temperatures

258
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,320
can exceed 80 degrees Celsius...

259
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,320
...he will be out foraging

260
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,480
amongst the cactus
of the Arizona desert.

261
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,320
By being out now,

262
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,680
he avoids competition
from other mammals.

263
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,400
But the squirrels don't
have it all their own way.

264
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,280
A rattlesnake,

265
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,840
which is looking for

266
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,600
a rodent-sized meal.

267
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,360
It's a stand-off...

268
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,680
...to see who can withstand

269
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,160
the most heat.

270
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,960
As the ground temperature
continues to rise,

271
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,160
the squirrel's core temperature

272
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,680
reaches 43 degrees Celsius.

273
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,320
That would be fatal for humans

274
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,400
and most other animals.

275
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,680
But the squirrels
have a clever trick

276
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,760
that can quickly reduce
their body temperature.

277
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,080
He heat-dumps.

278
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,280
By spreading its hot body

279
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,920
against the cooler sand
in the shade,

280
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,080
a squirrel can rapidly reduce

281
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,000
its body temperature down

282
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,800
by up to one degree a minute.

283
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,960
The rattlesnake
simply can't compete.

284
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,640
It has to find shelter

285
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,280
to avoid overheating.

286
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,640
With the coast now clear,

287
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,320
the squirrel can continue his search

288
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,440
{\an8}for the fruit
of the spiny cholla cactus.

289
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,760
But this one

290
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,200
has already lost
all of its low-hanging fruit.

291
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,880
There's only one thing for it.

292
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,240
He will have to clamber up

293
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,760
the spine-covered branches.

294
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,360
He must be very cautious.

295
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,680
But this fruit...

296
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,400
...is a stretch...

297
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,440
...too... far.

298
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,200
Try again.

299
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,040
But the price of success

300
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,400
can be painful.

301
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,960
He has to remove

302
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,440
some very sharp spines.

303
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,760
A final heat-dump

304
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,480
before enjoying the fruit

305
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,920
of his labour.

306
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,880
This tiny squirrel

307
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,400
has found a clever way
to deal with the heat.

308
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,400
But when you're nearly
six metres tall

309
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,520
and weigh almost two tonnes...

310
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,800
...it's altogether
a much bigger problem.

311
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,760
The Hoanib Valley

312
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,240
on Namibia's Skeleton Coast.

313
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,760
Home to some of nature's
real giants.

314
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,160
Giraffes.

315
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,200
This herd is guarded
by a dominant bull.

316
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,120
They spend much of their day
out in the open,

317
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,600
searching for food.

318
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,120
Their tongues are black

319
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,440
with a pigment
that acts as a sunblock.

320
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,880
But this is only one of the ways

321
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,480
by which a giraffe beats the heat.

322
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,600
It's now about to use

323
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,160
another of
its heat-beating adaptations.

324
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,840
A rival male.

325
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,680
He approaches the females.

326
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,680
The dominant bull
moves to intercept.

327
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,560
The bulls square up.

328
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,480
These blows are violent enough

329
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,160
to tear skin and break bone.

330
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,680
They're now pushing themselves
to the limit.

331
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,320
Their core temperatures

332
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,240
are rising to near-lethal levels.

333
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,200
The reason they don't overheat

334
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,320
is connected to
their distinctive skin pattern.

335
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,040
A thermal camera reveals

336
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,440
that below each brown spot

337
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,200
there is a dense network
of blood vessels.

338
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,640
As the giraffes'
body temperatures rise...

339
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
...these blood vessels expand...

340
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,200
...releasing body heat...

341
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,520
...so enabling them to fight on.

342
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,640
The force of each blow

343
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,360
is visible as a white-hot slash.

344
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,800
SNORTS

345
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,680
The dominant bull wins...

346
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,120
...and his rival retreats.

347
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,560
In Trinidad lives a mammal

348
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,520
that detects the heat
that animals produce...

349
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,960
...and uses it to guide them

350
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,720
to a drink of their victim's blood.

351
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,200
The white-winged vampire bat.

352
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
On the prowl

353
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,640
for its next victim.

354
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,120
This cockerel is fast asleep.

355
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,720
But the bat must be careful.

356
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,080
Cockerels are light sleepers.

357
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,000
The bite must be delivered

358
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,440
with precision.

359
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,520
Heat-sensitive receptors

360
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,160
enable vampire bats

361
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,080
to detect subtle differences

362
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,480
in temperature...

363
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,600
...so it can pinpoint exactly

364
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,520
where the warm blood
flows close to the skin.

365
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,040
She bites.

366
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,480
Her saliva contains
a powerful anticoagulant

367
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,400
known as draculin.

368
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,440
It ensures that the blood

369
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,720
continues to flow freely.

370
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,520
This helps her feed quickly

371
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,640
and avoids her being noticed.

372
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,000
But blood isn't,
in fact, very nutritious,

373
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,480
so the bats have to drink

374
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,400
over half their own body weight

375
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,120
in one sitting.

376
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,960
As a result,

377
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,440
flight becomes nearly impossible.

378
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,040
But her kidneys are remarkable...

379
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,080
...and quickly extract
the water from her meal.

380
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,840
So, within minutes,

381
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,360
she vanishes into the darkness...

382
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,160
...leaving the cockerel
none the wiser.

383
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,040
CLUCKS QUIETLY

384
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,000
While vampire bats use heat

385
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,360
from the blood of their victims
to find their meals,

386
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,760
one mammal
uses the heat from the sun.

387
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,960
Uganda, in Africa,

388
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,880
on the banks of the River Nile.

389
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,960
A troop of baboons has gathered

390
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,960
at the end
of the long, hot dry season.

391
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,880
They are waiting

392
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,640
for a very special
seasonal opportunity.

393
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,200
It begins

394
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,920
{\an8}with the annual emergence
of flying termites.

395
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,560
They provide the baboons

396
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,400
with a small but much-needed treat.

397
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,200
But the older members of the troop

398
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,720
know there is another delicacy
to be found here...

399
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,600
...one that provides them

400
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,000
with a far more nourishing meal.

401
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,840
SCREECHES

402
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,680
A Nile crocodile.

403
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,960
She laid her eggs...

404
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,040
...in the warm sand.

405
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,240
The baboons would steal them
if they could.

406
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,720
BARKS

407
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,480
But the crocodile,

408
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,960
weighing nearly a quarter of a ton,

409
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,400
is one of Africa's
most formidable predators

410
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,360
and well able to kill a baboon...

411
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,600
SNARLS

412
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,720
BARKS

413
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,400
HISSES

414
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,720
...so the utmost caution is required.

415
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,080
Their plan is simple.

416
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,600
They wait.

417
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,240
Whilst the crocodile
must stay in the sun,

418
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,920
guarding its nest...

419
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,000
...the baboons keep their cool
in the shade...

420
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,280
...waiting for just the right moment.

421
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,080
The crocodile begins to gape.

422
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,320
It's a way of losing heat.

423
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,560
The sun

424
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,960
gets stronger.

425
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,000
But the crocodile stays on guard

426
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
and risks overheating.

427
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,120
GRUNTS QUIETLY

428
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,720
Eventually, it gets so hot...

429
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,600
...that it takes to the water
to cool down.

430
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,160
But the baboons still do...

431
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,600
...nothing.

432
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,400
Their waiting game
has not yet finished.

433
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,640
{\an8}There's no sense

434
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,040
{\an8}in overexerting yourself
in the heat...

435
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,280
{\an8}...when you can
let hungry monitor lizards

436
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,840
{\an8}do the hard work.

437
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,160
Finally,

438
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,880
the moment
they have been waiting for.

439
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,520
MONITOR LIZARD HISSES

440
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,240
Now they need to move fast.

441
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,760
The crocodile
won't be away for long.

442
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,760
BABOONS BARK

443
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,360
CROCODILE HISSES

444
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,640
The oppressive heat

445
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,040
has allowed the baboons
to get the food they want.

446
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,000
But there are few places in Africa

447
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,800
where the battle to find food

448
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,480
is more demanding

449
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,640
than the Etosha salt pan in Namibia.

450
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,240
As temperatures rise
across this vast wilderness,

451
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,040
mammals of many kinds

452
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,160
are gathering around
a shrinking water hole.

453
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,360
DISTANT BRAYING

454
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,200
For a female jackal...

455
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,040
...this is a good place to hunt.

456
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,520
But it's almost too crowded.

457
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,280
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

458
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,280
For a jackal to be successful,

459
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,400
it needs to be clever.

460
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,600
Just a ghost

461
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,760
in the background.

462
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,800
Some of the largest mammals on Earth

463
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,720
dominate the water's edge.

464
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,080
ELEPHANT RUMBLES

465
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,400
The jackal must bide her time.

466
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,600
BABY ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

467
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,920
DISTANT SQUAWKING

468
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,480
She spots possible prey.

469
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,440
Guinea fowl.

470
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,560
ELEPHANT RUMBLES

471
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,600
SQUAWKING

472
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,360
Thirst, however,

473
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,240
dominates everything else.

474
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,280
And hunters and hunted

475
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,560
drink alongside one another.

476
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,840
Temperatures are still rising.

477
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,960
BRAYING

478
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,800
The drinkers start to quarrel...

479
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,720
...and she retreats.

480
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,360
But then...

481
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,680
...things get even more difficult.

482
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,600
A hyena.

483
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,200
More than capable

484
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,120
of killing a jackal.

485
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,360
But driven by hunger and thirst...

486
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,000
JACKAL YELPS

487
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,080
...this female holds her ground...

488
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,640
JACKAL YELPS

489
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,040
...and now can get back to hunting.

490
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,160
This time, she sets her sights

491
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,760
on a flock of doves...

492
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,880
...and tries a more subtle approach.

493
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,080
Hiding in plain sight.

494
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,120
Lulling the birds

495
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,960
into a false sense of security.

496
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,200
She waits for the perfect moment.

497
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,160
But they aren't so easily caught.

498
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,120
Nonetheless...

499
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,840
...she's determined.

500
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,400
Success at last.

501
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,560
Her mate arrives...

502
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,120
...and he has brought
their hungry pups with him.

503
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,880
With so many mouths to feed...

504
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,760
...she will have
to be hunting again soon.

505
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,200
PUP WHINES

506
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,720
Mammals have
an extraordinary ability

507
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,040
to find water...

508
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,480
...stay cool...

509
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,600
...and use heat

510
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,120
to their advantage.

511
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,720
That has enabled them to flourish

512
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,720
in some of the harshest
and hottest environments

513
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,200
on the planet.

514
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,240
But if the world is indeed
to become even hotter,

515
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,600
as is predicted...

516
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,360
...then the challenges facing mammals

517
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,720
will become greater
than they have ever been.

518
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,600
In Madagascar,

519
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,760
the Mammals team
hoped to be the first to film

520
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,360
some recently
discovered behaviour...

521
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,840
...sifaka lemurs tree-hugging.

522
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,160
But to get there,

523
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,920
it's a three-day drive
over rough terrain.

524
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,760
A little too much
for producer Rob Pilley.

525
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,240
HE RETCHES

526
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,600
Happy to be back on terra firma,

527
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,400
the team set off on foot

528
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,240
through the spiny forest.

529
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,160
They've joined forces

530
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,720
with local scientists

531
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,720
from the ESSA research group.

532
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,840
And thanks to their expertise,

533
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,560
it doesn't take long
to find the sifaka.

534
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,360
WHISPERS: They're
a little wary of humans,

535
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,080
so we have to go really slowly,
approach them slowly.

536
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,880
They're quite skittish.

537
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,680
The sifaka are much more nimble

538
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,360
moving through the forest

539
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,280
than the crew
carrying bulky kit.

540
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,840
Keeping up with the troop

541
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,200
is not without its snags.

542
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,840
Ah, everything is out to get you,

543
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,200
it's just this giant cactus forest.

544
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,040
They are everywhere, the spines.

545
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,040
And the dense scrub

546
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,480
makes getting any shots a challenge.

547
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,320
Yeah, it kind of makes you
almost forced to shoot

548
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,960
such high-angle shots
when it's so dense

549
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,680
cos we can't get further back.

550
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,600
Also just manoeuvring
around the forest,

551
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,200
it's pretty hectic.

552
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,520
Trying to go quietly
without snagging your camera

553
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,720
or your lens or a cable or...

554
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,720
...is, uh, not easy.

555
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,120
Over the following days,

556
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,080
the team struggle through the heat,

557
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,160
with the lemurs
giving them the run-around.

558
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,720
We just found a group and
they've just disappeared off.

559
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,000
This is going to be a marathon,
not a sprint.

560
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,560
Lemurs Behaving Badly!

561
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,040
As temperatures rise,

562
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,240
the lemurs finally seem to settle.

563
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,400
HE EXHALES

564
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,800
This could be
a breakthrough for the team.

565
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,320
WHISPERS: Stu is up front.

566
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,800
It's just possible

567
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,000
that we have found

568
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,720
the perfect tree-hugging group.

569
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,760
Fingers crossed.

570
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,960
Not this time.

571
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,880
Just been given the run-around
all morning by these lemurs -

572
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,800
starburst, every direction.

573
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,240
Couldn't get a single shot.

574
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,320
It's like the worst day ever!

575
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,720
Back at camp,

576
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,440
it's 45 degrees in the shade.

577
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,160
While Stuart finds a way
to cool himself off...

578
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,600
Whew! That's good!

579
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,840
...Jeandre is more worried
about the equipment.

580
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,720
We raised the laptop up
on these hard drives

581
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,120
to give it some cooling.
It's just too hot.

582
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,560
The cameras are melting.

583
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,040
The little metal pins in the camera

584
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,880
have literally melted. It's...

585
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,520
I've never had that on a shoot.

586
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,000
Despite the heat,

587
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,520
the team are forced to work

588
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,360
during the hottest part of the day

589
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,680
if they want to film

590
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,080
this unique tree-hugging behaviour.

591
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,200
But as the lemurs lead them
deeper into the forest,

592
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,720
they notice something is amiss.

593
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,920
In the heart
of this protected area,

594
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,480
there are signs
that trees have been felled.

595
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,560
We see for the last two, three years

596
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,960
increasing cutting within the forest

597
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,760
and we believe that it's because

598
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,200
these people are so desperate

599
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,680
and cut the trees for
the forage for their animals

600
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,680
and then for their daily needs.

601
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,720
With ongoing drought,

602
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,360
crops are failing,

603
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,400
and local people are forced

604
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,120
to turn to the forest
to make ends meet.

605
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,240
Across Madagascar,

606
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,000
deforestation and the effects
of climate change

607
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,040
are only making life harder

608
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,240
for both wildlife and people.

609
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,240
It's a sobering reminder to the team

610
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,000
of the problems
faced by these lemurs,

611
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,880
who are having to adapt
to a rapidly changing world.

612
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,520
Back on the trail,

613
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,640
the team split up
to cover more ground.

614
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,080
Now separated,

615
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,760
the researchers have
a special way to keep in touch.

616
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,560
HE WHOOPS

617
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,560
HE WHOOPS

618
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,560
Using calls similar to the animals

619
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,760
lets them maintain a low profile.

620
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,280
But as they push forward,

621
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,560
the heat of the day

622
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,680
is taking its toll
on Jeandre and Rob.

623
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,000
We... we all just have
to stop for a bit,

624
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,440
have a breather.

625
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,080
And when they start moving again,

626
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,000
they quickly realise they're lost.

627
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,400
It all looks the same.

628
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,320
I think it's up here.

629
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,800
We're not really quite sure...

630
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,040
...where we are.

631
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,880
HE WHOOPS

632
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,840
Ow!

633
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,040
In these conditions,

634
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,880
it only takes a few hours
for heatstroke to set in.

635
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,400
ROB WHOOPS

636
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,680
WHOOPING

637
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,840
Yeah, OK, they're ahead,
they're ahead. That's good.

638
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,400
There's a friendly face!

639
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,600
UNTRANSLATED

640
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,320
So nice to see you.

641
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,280
Somebody wandered off that way...

642
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,080
Quickly, things
can go really pear-shaped

643
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,520
unless you're on your game, so...

644
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,160
A lesson learned, definitely.

645
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,360
Despite this close call,

646
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,560
the team are determined to continue.

647
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,960
It's the hottest day so far,

648
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,040
which should work in their favour.

649
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,840
At last,

650
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,200
they find a group that is settling.

651
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:00,440
Lemurs only tree-hug
in the hottest conditions.

652
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,120
All the crew can do now is wait.

653
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,200
Finally...

654
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,560
...what they came for.

655
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,840
Thanks to the work
of this research team,

656
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:08,040
{\an8}the efforts to protect
the sifakas' home

657
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,080
will continue.

658
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,000
With the education

659
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
and working together
at different levels,

660
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,320
from locals to national,

661
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,840
to international levels,

662
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,920
for common goals,

663
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:25,120
then I be very optimistic,
the future of Madagascar.

664
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,080
Next time...

665
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,080
...forests, where we

666
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:38,960
discover how nearly three
quarters of all mammal species

667
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,160
have made their home in this,

668
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:47,360
the richest and most
diverse habitat...

669
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,640
...on Earth.
