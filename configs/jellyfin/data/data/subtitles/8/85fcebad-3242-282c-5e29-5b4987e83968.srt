1
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:52,725
Huh?

2
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:56,605
Oh!

3
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:07,365
Oh...

4
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:41,445
Hello. Is this emergency?

5
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:45,085
Yeah, I was just wondering if someone's
handed in a penis recently.

6
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:49,285
You will burn in hell
for this, you bastard!

7
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:56,405
Found it. Must have rolled
under the side of the bed.

8
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:58,445
Go! Go!

9
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:01,205
Mrs Alford?
Yes.

10
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:03,645
I was just wondering if your
husband Alexander was home.

11
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:05,365
Well, what's it about?

12
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:08,525
Hello there.

13
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:10,685
What seems
to be the trouble here?

14
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:13,325
Oh, yes.

15
00:02:13,485 --> 00:02:15,045
It's very bruised.

16
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:18,085
Is that tender?
Ooh! Yes!

17
00:02:18,245 --> 00:02:20,565
Yeah, I was kicked in them.

18
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:23,365
Here?
Oh, yeah! Yeah.

19
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:24,845
Does it hurt when you pass urine?

20
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:26,805
It hurts when I squeeze
toothpaste, mate.

21
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:28,885
It hurts when I change
radio stations.

22
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:30,685
It fucking hurts, alright?

23
00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:33,885
It's like I got a couple
of bowling balls down there.

24
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:35,405
Can you achieve an erection?

25
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:37,365
Do you really think
I'm gonna pull this out

26
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,565
in front of anybody without
six years of medical training?

27
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:41,325
It looks like a blue-ringed octopus!

28
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:44,205
Yes, well, I would avoid
show-and-tell for some time.

29
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,885
In fact, I'd be steering clear
of sex for a while.

30
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:49,325
Uh, I suspect it's only bruising,

31
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:51,205
but I wouldn't mind
running some tests.

32
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,885
You absolute bastard!

33
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:02,605
Uh, I'm sorry. Would you
excuse us, please, ladies?

34
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,805
I think someone's
got the grumps with me.

35
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:07,445
Excuse me.

36
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:16,445
You attack this woman

37
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:19,325
and then you conned me
into covering for you.

38
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:22,085
I haven't been charged
and I didn't do it.

39
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:26,045
Because of you, I perjured myself
in a sworn statement to the police.

40
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,205
Yes, yes. Why did you do that?

41
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:32,485
I had trouble understanding
that myself. Then I got these.

42
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:35,005
Where are they? Jesus, filing.

43
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:36,805
Oh, here we go!

44
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:43,245
Oh, look. Here's a nice one of you
getting into the lifts at the Hyatt.

45
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:45,445
1:51pm — around the same time

46
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,125
I'm supposed to be
knocking off this woman —

47
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:49,085
hot to go to the 21st floor.

48
00:03:49,245 --> 00:03:50,885
You had me followed?
No!

49
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:53,125
No interest in you whatsoever.

50
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,765
This is against the law.

51
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:58,365
Oh, surely you must know by now

52
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:01,885
for all practical purposes
I am the law in this state

53
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:03,925
and he is my direct opposition.

54
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:06,125
I mean, it's my business
to know everything about him.

55
00:04:06,285 --> 00:04:07,605
So imagine our delight

56
00:04:07,765 --> 00:04:10,005
when the pretzel gets in the lift
two minutes after you

57
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:12,525
and then guess what floor he goes to.

58
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,605
No, nothing happened.
I just had a drink with him.

59
00:04:15,765 --> 00:04:17,725
Well, this one suggests otherwise,

60
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:20,605
one hour and 15 minutes later.

61
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:23,165
Yeah, he's not a stayer, is he?

62
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:27,605
Look, word of advice
from an old hand, hey?

63
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:31,485
Always take two lifts
and leave 10 minutes apart.

64
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:35,485
You will never get away with
what you've done to this poor woman.

65
00:04:35,645 --> 00:04:38,045
You keep forgetting
I haven't been charged.

66
00:04:38,205 --> 00:04:40,645
I'm just a “person of interest”.

67
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:44,205
Gotta love that term.
It's worthy of a gravestone.

68
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:49,205
“Callum Dalgleish McGregor —
Person of Interest.”

69
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:51,365
You don't scare me.

70
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,005
Hmph.

71
00:05:07,325 --> 00:05:10,365
Wow.
Yeah, big wow, big wow.

72
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:13,605
OK, that's it. That has to be it.

73
00:05:13,765 --> 00:05:15,405
Oh, yeah, yeah.

74
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,405
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah, I can't...

75
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:21,165
We can't do this.
I can't keep doing this.

76
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:22,645
No, I know.

77
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:24,445
OK, OK.

78
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:25,925
I agree.

79
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:27,685
I'm getting married
in three weeks, you know?

80
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:30,525
If I keep doing this
I'm going to go mad.

81
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:34,165
I'm not this sort of person.
At least, I never thought I was.

82
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:37,805
I know. You're not. I'm not.
You're not and I'm not.

83
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:40,245
I'm not the kind of person
who has shabby affairs.

84
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:41,565
Yeah.

85
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:44,885
Oh...

86
00:05:45,885 --> 00:05:47,885
Alright.
OK.

87
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:50,125
Mm.
Yep, alright.

88
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:51,605
Mm, mm.

89
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:54,645
Yep.
Ooh.

90
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:08,805
This is late
even by my standards.

91
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:11,885
Get off my case, will you?
I got caught up, alright?

92
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:15,885
You've got Tuesday's buttons
in Wednesday's holes, mate.

93
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:17,365
So?

94
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:20,685
You once turned up to a conference
with the DPP in a dressing gown.

95
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:23,725
Yeah, but I'm the dissolute
brilliant one. You're Watson.

96
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:26,165
No, you're just dissolute.

97
00:06:28,245 --> 00:06:30,685
Still sore?
Oh...

98
00:06:30,845 --> 00:06:36,965
I'm tenured.
12 years as an IT lecturer.

99
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:42,725
I co-wrote the authoritative manual
on 120 ARM processing nodes.

100
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:45,285
So I should be
in a lecture hall right now

101
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:47,685
teaching my Indian students
about gigaflops

102
00:06:47,845 --> 00:06:49,845
and instead I'm here listening
to this humiliating nonsense.

103
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:51,325
Why is that?

104
00:06:51,485 --> 00:06:53,325
The police felt your recent history
with your neighbour

105
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:54,805
suggested a pattern.

106
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:57,845
There is no logical
sequence of events here

107
00:06:58,005 --> 00:06:59,805
describing a uniform pattern.

108
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:01,765
It's merely a few squabbles.

109
00:07:01,925 --> 00:07:04,725
And what? I'm supposed
to have cut off the man's Johnson?

110
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:06,205
It's more than a few squabbles.

111
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:08,805
The police have a list
of 23 separate incidents here

112
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:10,525
over a nine-month period.

113
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:15,125
I mean, even to non-computer people,
it does look like a bit of a pattern.

114
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:18,125
Now, I understand it all kicked off
with a noise complaint

115
00:07:18,285 --> 00:07:19,845
about a neighbour's birthday party.

116
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:21,805
Was it a 21st or something?

117
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:23,725
No, Hunter was turning six.

118
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:26,325
It was
an unbelievable commotion.

119
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:27,885
Tell them please, Alannah.

120
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:30,885
Well, I... We don't
have children of our own,

121
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:33,165
so we're not used
to that level of noise.

122
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:34,645
Alex called the police.

123
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:36,285
What time was this?

124
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:39,125
3:00 in the afternoon.
Oh, fair enough.

125
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:41,805
Alex had been to a conference
and he was trying to nap.

126
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:43,285
I was exhausted.

127
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:44,805
Then he dumped garbage
on your lawn

128
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,005
and then you dumped
an old tyre on his lawn?

129
00:07:47,165 --> 00:07:48,485
An old burning tyre.

130
00:07:48,645 --> 00:07:50,885
And then he cut down
our beautiful silver birch.

131
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:54,765
Yes, after you had
urinated in his petrol tank.

132
00:07:54,925 --> 00:07:57,205
Alex, this is
a very serious charge.

133
00:07:57,365 --> 00:07:59,005
The police have found
DNA evidence —

134
00:07:59,165 --> 00:08:00,965
your fingerprints
and traces of his blood

135
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,685
on the...on the instrument
they believe was used.

136
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:07,965
Yep, and I loaned him
those garden shears ages ago

137
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,445
and he never returned them.

138
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:11,485
Of course it's got my DNA on it.

139
00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:14,485
I told the police all this!
Does anyone listen anymore?

140
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:18,165
I understand you were all once friends

141
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:22,485
in a golden age before
Archduke Ferdinand was shot?

142
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:26,245
Alex and Bob were in
Rotary together, played squash...

143
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,725
Squash.

144
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:29,805
Went fishing.
Never caught a thing.

145
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:31,365
And were you friends with his wife?

146
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:33,485
Well, we played golf
a couple of times,

147
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:36,205
but she's very good
and I'm more of a tennis girl.

148
00:08:36,365 --> 00:08:40,325
I guess we were friends.
But this is so very wrong.

149
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:42,885
I did not cut off his business!

150
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:46,125
I did not.
Hmm.

151
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:48,325
I did not!

152
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:54,245
IT people just... We don't
do that sort of thing. JESUS!

153
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:56,725
We'll speak later?

154
00:08:58,645 --> 00:09:01,165
Darling?

155
00:09:03,925 --> 00:09:07,525
Alex and Alannah, Barbara and Bob...

156
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:10,045
The perfect initials
on the bathroom towels,

157
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:14,085
out here in this utopian dream.

158
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:17,245
What the fucking blue blazes
happened in there, mate?

159
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:20,805
Alex is a volunteer with St Johns
Ambulance. Alannah, Meals on Wheels.

160
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:23,685
Barbara golfs.
One of them collects penises.

161
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:30,085
The fall from grace is a bloody quick
elevator ride, mate, I'll tell you.

162
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:33,325
What man chops off
another man's tackle?

163
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:35,965
And then ties a piece of string
around the stump

164
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,245
so the victim doesn't
bleed to death?

165
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:41,805
Radical circumcision's
not a Rotarian rite, is it?

166
00:09:41,965 --> 00:09:44,045
They still frown on it.

167
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,245
It has to be Bob's wife.

168
00:09:47,405 --> 00:09:50,325
It's what wives do to husbands.
And she's a nurse.

169
00:09:50,485 --> 00:09:54,525
Oh, but the good Mrs Oakley
was at a golf tournie

170
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:58,765
with 200 eyewitnesses
admiring her short game.

171
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:08,485
I've met someone.

172
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:12,805
Shit.
Yeah.

173
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:15,445
Does Scarlet know?

174
00:10:15,605 --> 00:10:17,885
Sort of.

175
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:19,365
When you say ‘met'...

176
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:21,045
I mean I'm in...

177
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:25,525
I think there might be a chance
I'm in love with the woman.

178
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:29,205
She seems to make sense somehow.

179
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:30,685
And the sex, what she does...

180
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:32,645
Yeah, but are you sure that's not it?

181
00:10:32,805 --> 00:10:36,285
I mean, it could just be a root.
You're not obliged to fall in love.

182
00:10:36,445 --> 00:10:37,925
I'm not a farm animal.

183
00:10:38,085 --> 00:10:40,565
I don't just root people.
I'm not built that way.

184
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:43,685
It has to be love. It has to be.

185
00:10:43,845 --> 00:10:45,765
Do I know her?
No, no, no, no.

186
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:49,325
No, it... Look, it doesn't matter.
It's not going anywhere anyway.

187
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:51,765
She's getting... She's with someone.

188
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,845
Jesus.

189
00:10:57,525 --> 00:10:59,845
Why do chicks always feel the need

190
00:11:00,005 --> 00:11:02,085
to do the phone thing
with their fingers?

191
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:06,205
Do you think they think
we don't know what a phone is?

192
00:11:07,205 --> 00:11:08,845
When Alexander Bell
invented the phone,

193
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:12,165
do you think his wife invented
the finger thing at the same time?

194
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:15,605
Mate, the most wonderful news.
Cal McGregor's raped someone.

195
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:17,925
Direct from my contact
inside the force.

196
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:19,845
Has he been charged?
Not yet.

197
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:21,525
Not public. Still building a case.

198
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:23,085
But the only thing
standing between him

199
00:11:23,245 --> 00:11:25,205
and eight years
in an all-men's shower facility

200
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:28,245
is the testimony of that new bitch
working for him.

201
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:30,165
If you're referring
to Scarlet Engels,

202
00:11:30,325 --> 00:11:32,525
she and her husband
are friends of mine, OK?

203
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:35,285
OK, well, in that case,
I'm sorry to tell you

204
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,405
my cop contact reckons
she could be lying

205
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:39,605
and may end up
joining Cal in prison.

206
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:44,125
David, you do realise
this is a great day for the party?

207
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:46,845
I did mention she's a friend of mine!

208
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:59,165
Your boss is in a sea of trouble.

209
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:01,525
I'm told you're his only alibi.

210
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:05,445
Did you have a meeting with him
or are you covering for him?

211
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:07,565
Hello, David.

212
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:10,685
Are you asking me this
out of concern for me

213
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:12,885
or wanting to put
the boot into him?

214
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:15,005
I'm sorry, but I need to know.

215
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:17,965
Was this meeting real?
Did it happen?

216
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:22,365
No. I lied.

217
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:26,245
Jesus. You lied to the police?

218
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:29,285
You signed a sworn statement.

219
00:12:29,445 --> 00:12:31,125
That's right.

220
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:35,045
Have you any idea what you've done?
Why would you do that for him?

221
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:36,725
The meeting
that didn't happen with Cal

222
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:38,245
coincided perfectly with the time

223
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:41,045
that you and I were
angsting on a hotel bed

224
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:43,045
so I just thought...

225
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:45,165
You are kidding.

226
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:50,605
Had I known that I was supplying
a watertight diarised alibi for rape

227
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:52,325
I might have given it
a second thought,

228
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:55,645
but at the time all I could think was,
“Yay! We got away with it.”

229
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:58,725
You are not putting this on me.
I thought I was helping.

230
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:01,325
Oh, bugger that!
You were protecting yourself.

231
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:03,045
And Barney.

232
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:08,005
I'm sorry, Scarlet,
but no matter how I feel about you,

233
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:10,685
I cannot and will not
be a party to perjury.

234
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:14,325
You're on your own.

235
00:13:16,925 --> 00:13:19,165
That much I do know.

236
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:24,725
Hey.

237
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:26,965
What are you doing?
Timing.

238
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,885
Timing what?

239
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:31,605
This claims to be
a current affairs show.

240
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:33,725
They spent 2 minutes 10
on border protection

241
00:13:33,885 --> 00:13:37,285
and 6 minutes 20
on one of the lesser Kardashians.

242
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:40,925
Up next, I speak with celebrity
psychiatrist Cassandra Wilson

243
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:44,645
about what impact this divorce
might have on the family.

244
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:47,645
I once timed a sex scene
with Salma Hayek.

245
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:52,045
One of the happiest 1 minute
and 23.5 seconds of my life.

246
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:54,925
I thought we might go out for dinner.
Oh, I've eaten.

247
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,565
What did you eat?
Twisties.

248
00:13:56,725 --> 00:13:59,125
Can I interest you
in another food group?

249
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:07,885
Yeah?

250
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:11,045
Hey, I'm having
a dinner for Fuzz's birthday.

251
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:12,925
Has he told you he's got
a new girlfriend?

252
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,565
No. How old's this one?

253
00:14:14,725 --> 00:14:17,045
Do I have to pick her up
from an aged-care facility?

254
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:19,165
She's 17. I've met her once.

255
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,325
She's, um...she's a bit serious,
but she seems gorgeous and cute

256
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:24,325
and he's super-keen.

257
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:25,925
Bring Melissa if you like.

258
00:14:26,085 --> 00:14:27,725
Oh, I've told you —
it's not like that.

259
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:29,285
Did you? I don't remember.

260
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:32,525
I'm bringing someone.
Who are you bringing?

261
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:34,645
This guy.

262
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:36,845
Which guy?

263
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:40,245
Roger? Sally's ex, Roger.

264
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:43,245
So to our son's birthday dinner,

265
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:47,125
you are bringing the husband
of the woman our son was porking?

266
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:49,685
Fuzz gets on with him
and he likes Fuzz.

267
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:53,125
Vampira 2 has cleared off and
he's here looking after their kids.

268
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:54,685
And I like him.

269
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:56,325
Oh, you like him.

270
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:58,005
Yeah, I like him.

271
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,845
Yes. Yeah. I heard you.

272
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:01,365
What are you...

273
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:06,125
OK, well, it's nice that
you've got nice new friends.

274
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,605
Hang on. Have you got a problem?

275
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:11,365
No, I don't have a problem.
Why would I have... No.

276
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:13,405
There's no problem.

277
00:15:13,565 --> 00:15:15,165
I'll see you there.

278
00:15:26,445 --> 00:15:27,765
Oh.

279
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:31,445
Yes, are you right there? Do you wanna
throw a little something on?

280
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:33,005
I'm covered.

281
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,125
Yeah, you're covered
in a way that says,

282
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:39,925
“I'm naked apart from
this little bit of covering here.”

283
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:42,085
I'm gonna go to bed.

284
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:44,685
Oh, well...

285
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,405
Did you leave me any Twisties?

286
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:51,005
You sent me an official invitation —

287
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:54,085
“The honourable
August and Maria Vargas

288
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,765
“invite you to attend the matrimonial
of their most precious daughter,

289
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:59,885
“Nicolette Maria St Agnes Magda...”

290
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:01,605
Yeah, it did not say that

291
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:04,525
and I only invited you
because I thought you'd say no.

292
00:16:04,685 --> 00:16:08,045
What? Free canapés and booze
and a chance to laugh at your relatives?

293
00:16:08,205 --> 00:16:10,405
Why would I say no?
Please just don't come, OK?

294
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:13,925
You'll get drunk and you will argue with
my extremely right-wing family

295
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:15,405
and you'll ruin my special day.

296
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:19,125
I already RSVP'd. I am there, baby.

297
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:21,605
I'll be good.
Barney will keep his eye on me.

298
00:16:21,765 --> 00:16:23,325
No, he is not coming.

299
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:25,245
He's not available.
He won't be there.

300
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:26,965
What do you mean,
“He's not available”?

301
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,965
Barney never does anything.
Of course he's available.

302
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:41,725
“A coward.”
CLEAVER: Yes, Your Honour.

303
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:43,685
“A gutless peddler of smear”?

304
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:45,445
Yes, Your Honour.

305
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,245
“Unreliable...”
Yes, that too, Your Honour.

306
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:50,325
“..and untrustworthy.”

307
00:16:50,485 --> 00:16:53,365
Indeed, Your Honour, I called
the plaintiff all of those things.

308
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:56,005
So we're agreed
on the imputations, then.

309
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:58,485
At least that's some progress.

310
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:00,365
So, Mr Greene, where do you stand?

311
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:03,765
Well, Your Honour, I shall
of course be pleading truth.

312
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:06,605
I see it as my duty
not only to this court,

313
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:09,605
but to decent society at large

314
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:14,045
to prove that Mr Potter
is all of those things.

315
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:21,725
This stinks, you know?

316
00:17:21,885 --> 00:17:24,685
I didn't start it.
Yes, you did!

317
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:28,725
Mr Potter, you hold
yourself up publicly

318
00:17:28,885 --> 00:17:31,645
to be an honourable and truthful man.

319
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:34,845
Would that be a fair comment?

320
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:36,845
I don't know if I do that,

321
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:39,245
but I like to think of myself
as an honest man.

322
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:40,725
I see.

323
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:42,365
Mr Potter, this is a transcript

324
00:17:42,525 --> 00:17:46,885
of a TV interview you gave
on the ‘Today Project',

325
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:50,125
dated the 12th of July this year.

326
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:52,125
Is that correct?

327
00:17:53,245 --> 00:17:54,565
I suppose so.

328
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:58,765
Your Honour, if you turn
to the last page,

329
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:03,885
the interviewer, Ms Polly Nesbitt,
asks the plaintiff — and I quote —

330
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:08,605
‘Have you read the bestseller
‘A Thousand Lies I Have Told'

331
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:11,405
“by the ex-prostitute JM Doolan?

332
00:18:11,565 --> 00:18:15,605
“Word is that half her clients
were Labor Party bigwigs,”

333
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:20,965
to which you responded,
“I haven't read it.”

334
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,845
Later, in response
to another question,

335
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:28,805
“As I say, I don't know.
I haven't read it, Polly.

336
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:31,725
“I wish I had more time to read.

337
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:35,405
“I especially love fiction.”

338
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:40,485
Let me remind you, Mr Potter,
you are under oath here.

339
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:43,925
Have you read
‘A Thousand Lies I Have Told'?

340
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,645
Yes.

341
00:18:46,805 --> 00:18:48,125
Am I correct in assuming

342
00:18:48,285 --> 00:18:50,845
you had read it at the time
of the interview, Mr Potter?

343
00:18:52,205 --> 00:18:54,605
Yes.
I see.

344
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:57,245
So on national television
you openly lied

345
00:18:57,405 --> 00:19:00,205
to millions of your
fellow Australians?

346
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:07,485
That poor man. He was
only protecting his privacy.

347
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:09,285
Can't good people
make the odd mistake

348
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:10,765
without the whole world
judging them?

349
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:12,245
We're only human.

350
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:14,365
That's been my argument
since I was about 13.

351
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:18,565
No, you used up your quota
of forgivable mistakes years ago.

352
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,365
Ah!

353
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:23,565
I've called you in today

354
00:19:23,725 --> 00:19:27,605
because I thought we might settle
on an appropriate term

355
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:30,845
before this wretched trial
commences.

356
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,885
Uh, an appropriate term?

357
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:36,405
Mmm, yes.

358
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:38,725
An appropriate one.

359
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:41,765
An appropriate term
for what exactly, Your Honour?

360
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:43,685
We're grown men here.

361
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:46,005
Given the nature of the case,

362
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:49,045
references will be made
apropos the item in question

363
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:52,565
and we need to find
a workable term...

364
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,045
Ah!

365
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:56,765
..one that won't provoke
sniggers in the court.

366
00:19:56,925 --> 00:20:01,645
Right, so no, then,
to ‘meat popsicle' or ‘pink flute'?

367
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:04,085
I will not have this trial reduced

368
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,565
to a mindless sideshow
of tawdry innuendo and filth-talk.

369
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:09,725
Do you hear me, Cleaver?
Absolutely, Your Honour.

370
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:13,325
All fair seas,
no dingle dangles, no Mr Winkies.

371
00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:15,925
Wouldn't the term ‘penis'
satisfy, Dougal?

372
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:18,645
Ugly word.

373
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:24,085
I want something that might...elevate
this deeply unpleasant case.

374
00:20:24,245 --> 00:20:26,685
Well, it's a hard one to elevate,
isn't it?

375
00:20:26,845 --> 00:20:30,805
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to sound quite like it did.

376
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:34,245
I don't mean to be, uh,
indelicate, Your Honour,

377
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:39,405
but may I ask how you refer to it
in the home context?

378
00:20:39,565 --> 00:20:41,885
We never do.

379
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:44,685
Well, sometimes,

380
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:47,005
but in context of moments
of deep personal interconnection.

381
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:48,325
Of course.

382
00:20:48,485 --> 00:20:51,965
It's just that I know your wife
to be a woman of delicate sensibility

383
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,045
who would never use
an offensive term.

384
00:20:54,205 --> 00:20:57,805
When discussing matters of hygiene
when the boys were growing up,

385
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,885
she referred to it as a ‘whatnot'.

386
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:01,365
A ‘whatnot'?

387
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:03,965
Yes, a useful pseudonym
that causes few blushes,

388
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,925
but not appropriate here.

389
00:21:07,085 --> 00:21:11,485
Well, my father referred to it
as his ‘nonsense', or ‘nonny',

390
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,445
although I'm not sure either term
is legal lingua franca.

391
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:16,165
I'm very comfortable with either.

392
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:18,245
No, what I propose

393
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:21,885
is we should refer to it
by its correct Latin name,

394
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:24,085
the ‘membrum virile'.

395
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:26,045
‘Membrum virile'? I don't
think I've heard that one.

396
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:27,685
It's in ‘The Greater Dictionary'.

397
00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:29,605
Ah. Hmm.

398
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:31,685
I think it's wonderful!

399
00:21:31,845 --> 00:21:35,125
It's readily accessible,
it's inoffensive

400
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:37,485
and yet in common everyday usage.

401
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:40,085
Good! Then we are settled.

402
00:21:41,805 --> 00:21:45,685
I remind you gentlemen
this is a most serious charge

403
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:48,845
and the honour of the court
must not be traduced.

404
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:51,125
Your Honour.

405
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,445
Oh.
You right there?

406
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,405
Yeah, I copped one
in the membrum.

407
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:58,805
The Crown will present
detailed DNA evidence

408
00:21:58,965 --> 00:22:03,165
and a tale of a once happy community

409
00:22:03,325 --> 00:22:05,845
falling into hostility and violence

410
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:11,805
as a result of reprehensible actions
by the accused, Alexander Alford.

411
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:17,125
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

412
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:20,405
I ask you to look at this poor man.

413
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:24,325
Robert Oakley is
a respected public servant

414
00:22:24,485 --> 00:22:28,405
once charged with building
the Education Revolution

415
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:31,605
in the primary schools
of New South Wales.

416
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:34,525
He was a proud man,

417
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:39,565
but by virtue of the accused
and a pair of garden shears,

418
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,525
he has been separated

419
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:47,165
from that which traditionally
defines our masculinity.

420
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:51,245
Bob now can have no more children.

421
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:56,125
Relations with his lovely wife
will be forever tricky.

422
00:22:57,765 --> 00:22:59,445
This is a brutal, brutal crime

423
00:22:59,605 --> 00:23:03,925
by a man who deserves
your absolute condemnation.

424
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:11,085
The case against my client you will find
is entirely circum...stantial.

425
00:23:11,245 --> 00:23:17,445
In 100% of cases of the relatively
recent phenomenon of Bobbitting,

426
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,565
the assailant was found
to be a woman —

427
00:23:19,725 --> 00:23:22,365
the victim's lover or wife.

428
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:24,485
100%.

429
00:23:24,645 --> 00:23:27,685
And yet the Crown would have you
believe that my client,

430
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:33,085
a decent, hardworking IT lecturer,

431
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,485
was reduced to an act
of animal depravity

432
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:38,205
on the basis of what?

433
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:42,405
The Crown will try
to present examples

434
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:46,005
of squabbles between these families

435
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:48,325
where things may have gotten
a little out of hand,

436
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:51,725
but haven't we all known times

437
00:23:51,885 --> 00:23:56,085
when our neighbours
have driven us to madness,

438
00:23:56,245 --> 00:24:00,205
when we may have wanted to drop
a bit of litter on their lawn

439
00:24:00,365 --> 00:24:05,245
or scrawl a commonly used
expletive on a child's slide

440
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:08,485
or...or urinate in their petrol tank?

441
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:11,645
But how many here
would seriously think

442
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:16,885
that this could lead
to the sort of terrible crime

443
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:19,565
that my client is accused of?

444
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:23,365
Ladies and gentlemen,
it makes no sense.

445
00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:26,045
The surgeons managed
to sew it back on.

446
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:29,285
I'm only grateful that I already have
two beautiful children

447
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:31,445
and a wife who's prepared
to stand by me.

448
00:24:31,605 --> 00:24:33,285
You are a monster!

449
00:24:33,445 --> 00:24:36,365
Please, control yourself.

450
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:40,405
The police report tells us
that there were traces of Rohypnol

451
00:24:40,565 --> 00:24:42,765
in the bottle of cider
that you drank that night.

452
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:44,245
That's correct.

453
00:24:44,405 --> 00:24:45,725
Alex knew every night before dinner

454
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:47,725
I liked my small bottle
of imported English cider.

455
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:49,885
Presumably, he wouldn't
have been the only person

456
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:52,285
who would have been
a custodian of that information.

457
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:54,405
Your wife, among many others,
would have known.

458
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:56,405
Well, my wife was away
for the weekend

459
00:24:56,565 --> 00:24:58,285
at a golf tournament
when I was attacked.

460
00:24:58,445 --> 00:25:02,245
Tell us, when was the last time
my client was in your home?

461
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:05,165
Um, maybe 18 months ago.
I see.

462
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:07,485
So you figure that 18 months ago,

463
00:25:07,645 --> 00:25:09,725
knowing that he was
going to fall out with you,

464
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:15,845
my client slipped a sleeping draught
in ye olde English cider bottle

465
00:25:16,005 --> 00:25:17,405
and bided his time?

466
00:25:17,565 --> 00:25:19,565
Obviously, he broke in
when I was out.

467
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:24,965
Oh, I see. So locks were broken?
There were signs of unlawful entry?

468
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:26,445
No, but he is a computer expert,

469
00:25:26,605 --> 00:25:28,125
so he could've decoded
my security system.

470
00:25:28,285 --> 00:25:29,285
I see.

471
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:32,725
He could've been the bassoon player
with the Lithuanian Philharmonic,

472
00:25:32,885 --> 00:25:34,205
but he wasn't.

473
00:25:35,845 --> 00:25:39,365
Tell me, always been faithful
to your wife, Mr Oakley?

474
00:25:40,685 --> 00:25:42,005
Yes.
Right.

475
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,805
May I remind you
you are under oath here.

476
00:25:44,965 --> 00:25:48,605
You've never slept with
another woman while married?

477
00:25:48,765 --> 00:25:52,245
No, never. I mean,
Barbara's my rock.

478
00:25:52,405 --> 00:25:55,285
No further questions.
Thank you, Your Honour.

479
00:25:56,285 --> 00:25:59,445
Now, to be absolutely clear,
you spent the night in question

480
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:01,525
in the company of women
at a golf tournament?

481
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,805
123, to be precise.

482
00:26:03,965 --> 00:26:06,445
That's a lot of witnesses.

483
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:09,925
Given the number of incidents
you have recounted to this court,

484
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:12,325
you became fearful of
your neighbour, the accused?

485
00:26:12,485 --> 00:26:14,405
I did. He changed.

486
00:26:14,565 --> 00:26:17,085
Alex was a placid, shapeless man

487
00:26:17,245 --> 00:26:20,525
who used to bore us with the
pros and cons between PCs and Macs

488
00:26:20,685 --> 00:26:23,085
and suddenly he seemed to snap.

489
00:26:23,245 --> 00:26:24,805
It was...

490
00:26:25,805 --> 00:26:28,605
..it was like living
in the Gaza Strip.

491
00:26:28,765 --> 00:26:30,165
You said in your testimony

492
00:26:30,325 --> 00:26:34,485
that you heard Alex threaten to cut off
your husband's membrum virile.

493
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:35,965
His what?

494
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:38,445
His membrum virile.

495
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:41,085
His...whatnot.

496
00:26:42,525 --> 00:26:46,365
Nonsense. Nonny.

497
00:26:46,525 --> 00:26:47,925
His penis, you mean?

498
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:54,285
Now, what exactly are you claiming
the accused said, Mrs Oakley?

499
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:55,765
I heard raised voices

500
00:26:55,925 --> 00:26:58,845
and Alex yelling,
“I'll bloody chop your knob off.”

501
00:26:59,005 --> 00:27:02,005
So he made no direct
anatomical reference whatsoever,

502
00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:06,245
a ‘knob' meaning anything from
a door handle to a node of butter.

503
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:10,045
Now, tell me, as a trained nurse
of 12 years standing,

504
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:14,485
how difficult would it be
to apply a clamp after severance?

505
00:27:14,645 --> 00:27:17,445
I think you would need to know
what you were doing.

506
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:19,565
I thought as much.

507
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:23,365
You do know that Alex did
several St Johns Ambulance courses?

508
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:26,045
So they teach that,
do they, at St Johns —

509
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:30,645
snakebites, CPR,
membrum virile removal?

510
00:27:40,365 --> 00:27:42,965
“Bevan, with all my heart,
I give myself to you,

511
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:45,165
“knowing our love
will last a lifetime,

512
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:48,725
“that our long journey together
will be one of discovery

513
00:27:48,885 --> 00:27:51,805
“as we share each other's
dreams and hopes

514
00:27:51,965 --> 00:27:55,525
“and build a future and...”

515
00:28:06,365 --> 00:28:09,125
Barney, can you meet me, please?

516
00:28:13,285 --> 00:28:15,245
Dad.
Ah.

517
00:28:15,405 --> 00:28:17,125
It's really great to see you.

518
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:20,525
How are you?
Oh, I'm good. Good, mate.

519
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:22,005
Happy birthday.

520
00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:23,525
Yeah, no, well done, Cleave.

521
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:26,125
What? It only took you
four reminders this year.

522
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:27,605
Come on, Mum.

523
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:30,085
Uh, Dad, this is Tara.

524
00:28:30,245 --> 00:28:32,045
Lovely to meet you, Tara.
You too.

525
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:35,045
And this is Melissa.
Oh, I read your book.

526
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:37,845
Oh, how'd you go with it?
I finished it.

527
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:39,445
Well, I loved it,

528
00:28:39,605 --> 00:28:42,605
although I did wonder about
that childlike, substance-abusing,

529
00:28:42,765 --> 00:28:44,165
backgammon-playing lawyer.

530
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:45,925
I mean, could anyone be
that dysfunctional?

531
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:47,405
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

532
00:28:47,565 --> 00:28:49,685
Well, it's great
to have both of you here.

533
00:28:49,845 --> 00:28:51,165
Mm, now listen, mate.

534
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:53,605
I thought you could
probably do with the dough

535
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:55,405
rather than a boring old present, OK?

536
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:56,885
Thanks, Dad.

537
00:28:57,045 --> 00:28:59,405
Just don't cash it
before the 17th.

538
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:02,325
And actually...
Oh, give me a call, OK?

539
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:05,125
You could use that to buy those books
I was telling you about.

540
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,605
Well,
I'm sure our author here

541
00:29:06,765 --> 00:29:09,205
would be thrilled to hear
you're buying books.

542
00:29:09,365 --> 00:29:12,085
It's a series
and they're all connected.

543
00:29:12,245 --> 00:29:13,845
With each one,
you kind of learn more.

544
00:29:14,005 --> 00:29:15,725
- The plot thickens.
- Hello!

545
00:29:15,885 --> 00:29:17,765
- Oh, hey, Rog!
- Hey, Rog.

546
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:19,245
Hello.
This is Tara.

547
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:21,685
Hey, Tara. How are you? Hey.
Hey.

548
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:23,565
Um, Roger... Cleaver,
you remember Roger?

549
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:25,165
Indeedy I do.

550
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:27,045
I've been looking forward
to seeing you, Cleave.

551
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:29,685
I've been counting
the hours too, Roger.

552
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:32,205
Now, from memory, you are
a big Rabbitohs fan, right?

553
00:29:32,365 --> 00:29:35,765
Yeah, no, not really.
I've sort of gone off the game.

554
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:37,885
Since when?
Oh, I don't know.

555
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:42,285
Lately it's all just kind of sexual
assault and groin strain these days.

556
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:45,805
Oh, it's a shame you've gone off it.
Roger consults as an osteopath.

557
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:47,885
Could have gotten you
free season tickets.

558
00:29:48,045 --> 00:29:49,205
Mmm.

559
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,965
Now...

560
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:56,325
For you, Fuzz.

561
00:29:56,485 --> 00:30:00,525
Spot's old jumper,
signed and possibly unwashed.

562
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:02,765
Brilliant. Oh, thanks, Roger.

563
00:30:02,925 --> 00:30:05,125
Oh, man, you can smell
the sweat and blood.

564
00:30:05,285 --> 00:30:07,805
Not forgetting
the lady of the house —

565
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:10,125
now, you said you liked
authentic kasundi, right?

566
00:30:10,285 --> 00:30:12,365
Oh!
God knows what it's like.

567
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:14,565
Feel free to chuck it in the bin.
Rog, no.

568
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:17,845
I find kasundi a little bland
or something. You know what I mean?

569
00:30:18,005 --> 00:30:21,725
It's a bit... Melissa makes her own
harissa relish. Don't you, darling?

570
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:23,205
No, I don't.

571
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:26,685
I thought you said you did.
No, you didn't.

572
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:29,925
Happy birthday,
Fuzz, darling.

573
00:30:30,085 --> 00:30:33,045
Yes, happy birthday, buddy.
Good on you.

574
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:35,205
Good on you, mate.
Thanks, Roger. Thanks, everyone.

575
00:30:35,365 --> 00:30:36,845
Many happy returns.
Yep.

576
00:30:38,285 --> 00:30:39,685
Well, dig in.

577
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:42,885
Would you mind before we start?

578
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:45,885
Mind what?
If we hold hands.

579
00:30:47,365 --> 00:30:49,805
Uh, well, not in principle,
but how am I gonna eat?

580
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:52,445
It's something I need
to do before each meal, Dad.

581
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:55,125
To pay respect to his bounty.

582
00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:57,845
Whose bounty, sorry?

583
00:30:58,005 --> 00:30:59,725
Dad.

584
00:30:59,885 --> 00:31:02,725
Ohh.

585
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:12,645
J Jesus is our friend

586
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:16,565
♪ He's here with us tonight

587
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:19,965
♪ Let's make him welcome

588
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:23,125
♪ Show our delight

589
00:31:23,285 --> 00:31:25,605
♪ Jesus is our Lord

590
00:31:25,765 --> 00:31:29,645
♪ Rejoice in his blessing

591
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:35,645
♪ Jesus is our Lord! ♪

592
00:31:35,805 --> 00:31:37,885
Amen.
Amen.

593
00:31:40,685 --> 00:31:42,285
This looks great.

594
00:31:42,445 --> 00:31:44,005
Well done, Mum.

595
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:45,485
God Almighty!

596
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:48,005
Oh, f... Arggh!

597
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:51,725
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

598
00:32:04,885 --> 00:32:06,765
Your Honour,
I respectfully submit

599
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,965
the charges against
my client be dismissed.

600
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:12,325
There is clearly a serial
Bobbitter on the loose.

601
00:32:12,485 --> 00:32:13,965
We now have two...

602
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:17,445
Uh, I'm sorry. What would
the plural be — ‘membri'?

603
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:21,125
That would be second
declension neuter, yes.

604
00:32:21,285 --> 00:32:23,245
And how appropriate
that it is ‘neuter', Your Honour.

605
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:25,445
What do you have to say
about this, Mr Crown?

606
00:32:25,605 --> 00:32:28,045
Your Honour,
the prosecution wishes to continue.

607
00:32:28,205 --> 00:32:33,725
Are you seriously suggesting
the man de-membrimised himself?

608
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:36,765
Well, it's possible in order
to escape a lengthy prison term

609
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:39,845
the accused committed
an act of self-mutilation.

610
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:41,405
We've already established this man

611
00:32:41,565 --> 00:32:44,445
is prepared to do absolutely anything
in this neighbourhood war.

612
00:32:44,605 --> 00:32:48,605
Your Honour,
rather than torturing my poor client,

613
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:51,445
we should be out there
advising the good burghers of Concord

614
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:53,165
to wear protective kit.

615
00:32:53,325 --> 00:32:54,645
No, Mr Greene.

616
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:57,205
I have heard nothing that warrants
dismissal of this case.

617
00:32:57,365 --> 00:32:58,685
We shall continue Friday.

618
00:32:58,845 --> 00:33:00,685
If your client is unable to attend,

619
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,445
the court will organise
a video link.

620
00:33:03,605 --> 00:33:05,325
He'll make it here.

621
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:10,485
A couple of ounces lighter maybe,
but he will be here.

622
00:33:10,645 --> 00:33:13,645
So I was thinking I'd start with a lunch
with Kristen at the ‘Herald'.

623
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:15,565
“Awful about that
Cal McGregor rape shit.

624
00:33:15,725 --> 00:33:18,165
“Oh, you didn't know?
Please forget I said anything.

625
00:33:18,325 --> 00:33:19,725
“Is your salad soggy?”

626
00:33:19,885 --> 00:33:21,445
The man hasn't been charged yet.

627
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:23,045
That's why we leak it.

628
00:33:23,205 --> 00:33:25,645
Publicly, of course,
you say you won't comment,

629
00:33:25,805 --> 00:33:27,725
‘Everyone has the right
to the presumption of innocence,

630
00:33:27,885 --> 00:33:29,205
“pblah, blah, blah,”

631
00:33:29,365 --> 00:33:31,525
but we get it out there —
otherwise we lose traction.

632
00:33:31,685 --> 00:33:33,205
I think cool heads.

633
00:33:33,365 --> 00:33:35,245
Jesus, David.
You're a bloody killjoy.

634
00:33:35,405 --> 00:33:37,245
This is the first glimmer of hope
we've had

635
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:39,285
since that last
bowel-cleansing election.

636
00:33:39,445 --> 00:33:42,005
Well, can't we look for hope
in our policies and our people

637
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:44,245
and our agenda going forward

638
00:33:44,405 --> 00:33:46,365
rather than always
be tearing down other people

639
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,085
on the basis of gutter talk?

640
00:33:51,205 --> 00:33:52,685
What? You are joking, right?

641
00:33:52,709 --> 00:34:00,709
http://hiqve.com/

642
00:34:22,965 --> 00:34:26,405
Do you know
who I hate most of all?

643
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,045
Me?

644
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:29,725
Never you.

645
00:34:29,885 --> 00:34:31,885
Mick Jagger.

646
00:34:32,045 --> 00:34:35,125
The man's spent a lifetime
behaving exactly as he likes —

647
00:34:35,285 --> 00:34:37,645
women, parties, drugs, more women.

648
00:34:37,805 --> 00:34:41,405
I've spent 40 years
trying to have good values,

649
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:43,525
trying to forge the kind of life

650
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:46,605
that would lead me
to the position I now occupy.

651
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:50,245
But if you ask any man —
or any woman, for that matter —

652
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:52,525
whose life they'd prefer,
his or mine...

653
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:54,845
He does move well.

654
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:57,365
40 years.

655
00:34:57,525 --> 00:34:59,405
If only they'd tell you
when you're little,

656
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:02,605
“Go feral, do as you please.
Everyone will love you for it.”

657
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:05,125
Why wasn't I told?

658
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:08,965
How many people do you reckon
die paragons of virtue

659
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:11,085
simply because
they didn't get found out?

660
00:35:11,245 --> 00:35:12,565
Impossible these days.

661
00:35:12,725 --> 00:35:15,525
One foot out of line, a millisecond
later, there you are on YouTube.

662
00:35:15,685 --> 00:35:19,365
Yeah, everyone knows
everyone else's business.

663
00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:22,445
Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn...

664
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:25,805
Do you know how many phone accounts
we have, David? Seven.

665
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:29,605
Seven phone bills arrive every month

666
00:35:29,765 --> 00:35:32,165
and I don't want
to speak with anyone.

667
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:35,325
Oh, fuck them.

668
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:39,045
Tell them whatever you want.
I don't care.

669
00:35:40,045 --> 00:35:42,005
Time to be a rock star.

670
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:48,165
David.

671
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:50,325
I'm really sorry.

672
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:55,365
I am truly really fucking sorry.

673
00:36:22,485 --> 00:36:25,605
I am so sorry, from the bottom
of my heart. I mean it.

674
00:36:25,765 --> 00:36:28,005
I'm really...I'm really truly sorry.
Thank you.

675
00:36:28,165 --> 00:36:30,565
Things happen and you
don't have any idea why

676
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:33,205
and you don't mean for them to happen,
but they just happen anyway.

677
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:35,485
And I'm really not a bad person.
I promise.

678
00:36:35,645 --> 00:36:36,965
I never thought you were.

679
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,885
Oh, God. This is such a bloody mess.

680
00:36:43,485 --> 00:36:45,525
Wedding plans going well, I see?

681
00:36:45,685 --> 00:36:47,285
Mm-hm.

682
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:57,325
To say I'm surprised would be
selling the truth below wholesale.

683
00:36:57,485 --> 00:36:59,365
I'm in trouble.

684
00:37:00,605 --> 00:37:02,005
The last time I saw you

685
00:37:02,165 --> 00:37:05,365
you told me to get out and said
you never wanted to see me again.

686
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:07,405
Yeah, I know what I said.

687
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:10,205
I'm sorry.

688
00:37:10,365 --> 00:37:12,765
Well, are you sorry
or are you in trouble?

689
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:15,925
Because I'm afraid I'm knee-deep
in penises at the moment.

690
00:37:16,085 --> 00:37:18,645
I think I'm going to go to prison.

691
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:20,965
Right.

692
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:23,365
Scarlet
loves you so much, Barney,

693
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:26,205
and I love Bevan
and I am gonna make this work

694
00:37:26,365 --> 00:37:30,085
and if you love me, then you'll be happy
for me and you won't see me again.

695
00:37:30,245 --> 00:37:33,205
Hang on, hang on.
You said you saw my wife.

696
00:37:33,365 --> 00:37:36,245
Yeah, she confronted me
in Cleaver's room.

697
00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:38,925
She confronted you?

698
00:37:39,085 --> 00:37:41,165
What the hell was she doing
in Cleaver's room?

699
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:42,645
She came to see me.

700
00:37:42,805 --> 00:37:47,445
She knows and I...I started
crying and it's just all...

701
00:37:47,605 --> 00:37:49,325
Goodbye.

702
00:37:51,125 --> 00:37:54,005
You may not
have a legal problem.

703
00:37:54,165 --> 00:37:56,685
The wheels of justice,
being what they are,

704
00:37:56,845 --> 00:37:59,725
will gradually grind
Cal's victim into the dirt

705
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:03,125
until she can no longer
remember her own name.

706
00:38:03,285 --> 00:38:05,725
What you do have is a moral problem.

707
00:38:05,885 --> 00:38:10,285
So do I protect this woman
and incriminate myself?

708
00:38:10,445 --> 00:38:12,925
I'm gonna have to ask you
who you were with.

709
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:15,765
That's not relevant.
Well, you know they'll ask.

710
00:38:16,765 --> 00:38:18,165
David.

711
00:38:18,325 --> 00:38:19,965
David?
Mm.

712
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:24,805
David Attenborough? David Beckham?

713
00:38:27,085 --> 00:38:29,285
Oh, please, no!

714
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:32,645
David-not-Harry-sorry... Fuck!

715
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:37,445
Oh! What is it with this guy?

716
00:38:37,605 --> 00:38:39,965
I open the cookie jar
and he shoves his hand in!

717
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:41,445
Thanks for that analogy.

718
00:38:41,605 --> 00:38:43,005
You know this little prick

719
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:46,245
is currently suing me for every cent
I have, the little hypocrite?

720
00:38:46,405 --> 00:38:50,965
That's not my concern. I...
Nothing happened between me and him.

721
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:53,845
Please, can you just
tell me what to do?

722
00:38:54,005 --> 00:38:56,645
Well, you know what you have to do.

723
00:38:56,805 --> 00:39:00,965
Cal McGregor can't get away with this
no matter what happens to you.

724
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:03,365
We're gonna have to
go to the police.

725
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:06,165
And tell the truth?
Not what I said.

726
00:39:06,325 --> 00:39:08,685
Give us your phone.

727
00:39:08,845 --> 00:39:11,525
You see? It's in Arabic.

728
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:14,965
Three months ago, a stupid joke
played on me at a party.

729
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,445
Guilty.

730
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:20,205
And it keeps reverting to Arabic
and it has a Muslim calendar.

731
00:39:20,365 --> 00:39:23,365
When I try to adjust it,
the date shifts back a day.

732
00:39:23,525 --> 00:39:26,605
So the meeting that I swore
I was at with Cal McGregor

733
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:28,405
I now realise was the day before.

734
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:30,325
If you knew the phone was dodgy

735
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:33,645
why didn't you double-check the dates
before signing your statement?

736
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:37,165
Well, she did, but her office computer's
linked to this phone

737
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:38,725
and so the mistake was carried.

738
00:39:38,885 --> 00:39:40,205
See, that's what
interconnectivity is.

739
00:39:40,365 --> 00:39:42,645
It's basically the same fuck-up
replicated globally.

740
00:39:42,805 --> 00:39:44,765
Thank you.
I feel terrible about this, Scarlet.

741
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:46,525
No, it's as much my fault, Cleave.

742
00:39:48,405 --> 00:39:50,685
You do realise
it's a very serious offence

743
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:53,085
to lie on a sworn statement
to the police?

744
00:39:53,245 --> 00:39:54,565
Absolutely she does,

745
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,405
and that's why as soon as she realised
she came straight here.

746
00:39:59,405 --> 00:40:01,365
Well, you're in luck.

747
00:40:02,365 --> 00:40:03,965
It would seem the woman in question

748
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,405
has admitted she can't
be certain of the facts.

749
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:08,085
The charges have been dropped.

750
00:40:08,245 --> 00:40:11,525
But they...they could be true.

751
00:40:11,685 --> 00:40:13,685
That's what I'm saying.
His alibi doesn't necessarily hold.

752
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:15,325
It's over.

753
00:40:16,765 --> 00:40:18,525
Consider yourself lucky.

754
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:28,005
He got to her. If I'd come
forward at the time...

755
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:30,525
No, no, he would've
still paid her off.

756
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:32,165
Come on. You're in the clear.

757
00:40:32,325 --> 00:40:34,365
Mm, so I'm respectable again.
Yeah.

758
00:40:34,525 --> 00:40:35,845
That was easy.

759
00:40:36,005 --> 00:40:37,965
God, it's so bloody tenuous.

760
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,445
Wouldn't know.

761
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:43,645
I've never been respectable,
never had all that far to fall.

762
00:40:43,805 --> 00:40:45,725
I gotta go.

763
00:40:46,725 --> 00:40:48,605
Are you OK?

764
00:40:50,405 --> 00:40:53,485
I have missed you, you know.

765
00:41:00,485 --> 00:41:03,485
Jesus. I'll go.
Thanks. Same. 'Bye.

766
00:41:05,165 --> 00:41:07,765
Alex, you have to tell us
what happened, mate.

767
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:11,565
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube...

768
00:41:11,725 --> 00:41:13,045
Oh, not me.

769
00:41:13,205 --> 00:41:16,245
Give me Cobalt, give me Pascal,

770
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:20,005
give me BASIC, Visual Basic,

771
00:41:20,165 --> 00:41:23,805
C any day.

772
00:41:25,245 --> 00:41:27,765
That's the kind of guy I am.

773
00:41:30,725 --> 00:41:32,645
Thought I am.

774
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:36,365
A trojan got into the system.

775
00:41:36,525 --> 00:41:40,205
That's what happened.
A virus corrupted my system.

776
00:41:42,725 --> 00:41:46,085
All Alannah ever wanted was kids.

777
00:41:46,245 --> 00:41:47,725
And you couldn't have them?

778
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:51,445
She was desperate,
crying all the time.

779
00:41:51,605 --> 00:41:54,525
The doctors said that she was
an intensely fertile woman,

780
00:41:54,685 --> 00:41:56,245
so the problem had to be me.

781
00:41:56,405 --> 00:42:02,285
So I...I paid that miserable bastard
$15,000 to impregnate her.

782
00:42:02,445 --> 00:42:06,965
Right, so you paid Bob
to artificially inseminate Alannah?

783
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:11,245
No, she wanted it all to be natural.

784
00:42:12,525 --> 00:42:14,685
She had no time for test tubes.

785
00:42:14,845 --> 00:42:20,725
OK, and how many times would you say
that she and Bob were...natural?

786
00:42:20,885 --> 00:42:22,645
43 times...

787
00:42:24,165 --> 00:42:26,525
..at critical moments in her cycle.

788
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:29,405
That's quite a lot of natural.

789
00:42:29,565 --> 00:42:31,965
And did his wife know about this?

790
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:35,845
No, he made it a condition
that she didn't know.

791
00:42:36,005 --> 00:42:37,485
But Alannah didn't conceive?

792
00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:41,005
And he flatly refused
to give us our money back.

793
00:42:41,165 --> 00:42:44,885
He was paid to impregnate her,
not to have sex with her.

794
00:42:45,045 --> 00:42:46,805
We were cheated —

795
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:49,645
me of my money and her of a baby.

796
00:42:49,805 --> 00:42:53,205
It's like someone turning up
to make your driveway, but...

797
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:56,805
..not bringing cement.

798
00:42:56,965 --> 00:43:00,605
You realise this has implications,
it gives the prosecution a motive?

799
00:43:00,765 --> 00:43:02,965
I've been lying here
for the last four days

800
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:06,365
wondering, “If I'd been a Mac guy would
my life have been different?”

801
00:43:08,245 --> 00:43:12,725
Using a UNIX-based system
with a C++ language...

802
00:43:18,605 --> 00:43:20,845
Harder for trojans to get in.

803
00:43:21,005 --> 00:43:23,085
43 times without scoring?

804
00:43:23,245 --> 00:43:25,165
The man should avoid poker.

805
00:43:25,325 --> 00:43:28,605
Doesn't help our boy, though.
Puts him dead in the spotlight.

806
00:43:30,645 --> 00:43:32,045
Barn?

807
00:43:32,205 --> 00:43:35,725
Yeah, they're gonna argue
it was an eye for an eye, so to speak.

808
00:43:35,885 --> 00:43:38,565
I still smell a woman's hand
in there somewhere.

809
00:43:38,725 --> 00:43:42,365
How can we get our hands
on his and Oakley's medical records?

810
00:43:42,525 --> 00:43:44,085
Listen.

811
00:43:44,245 --> 00:43:46,645
Nicole said she saw Scarlet
in your office.

812
00:43:46,805 --> 00:43:49,325
Yeah.
Why?

813
00:43:49,485 --> 00:43:53,325
I think she thinks
that I've been punished enough

814
00:43:53,485 --> 00:43:55,565
and so it's cool
for us to work together.

815
00:43:55,725 --> 00:43:57,845
She said that?
Yeah.

816
00:43:58,005 --> 00:43:59,525
Words to that effect.

817
00:43:59,685 --> 00:44:03,285
See if you can get your hands
on Bob Oakley's medical records.

818
00:44:06,965 --> 00:44:08,445
Alright.

819
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:11,885
Why? Cough.

820
00:44:12,045 --> 00:44:14,285
I don't have a cold. Neither does it.

821
00:44:14,445 --> 00:44:16,005
Alright, don't, then.

822
00:44:16,165 --> 00:44:18,605
The swelling seems to be subsiding.

823
00:44:18,765 --> 00:44:20,165
All your tests are back.
Everything's OK.

824
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,725
Should be back to full strength
in a week or so.

825
00:44:24,605 --> 00:44:29,085
Hey, uh, Bern, did you
look at those files I sent you?

826
00:44:29,245 --> 00:44:31,925
I told you, Cleaver,
he's not my patient.

827
00:44:32,925 --> 00:44:36,565
But...let me ask you this.

828
00:44:37,565 --> 00:44:40,885
Does he have a permanent cold?
Nah...

829
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:44,525
Oh, well, he's always sneezing.
Huh.

830
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:48,445
Could be silica on the balls.
It makes men infertile.

831
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:51,445
Well, it can't be that.
He's got two kids.

832
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,085
Ah.

833
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:58,605
OK, give Daddy a hug. Aww!

834
00:44:58,765 --> 00:45:01,005
Daddy loves you very much.

835
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:02,645
OK, OK.
Rig, get off.

836
00:45:02,805 --> 00:45:04,805
Rigby, Daddy's not
a well man. Come on.

837
00:45:04,965 --> 00:45:06,285
‘Bye, kids!

838
00:45:06,445 --> 00:45:08,485
Come on, Bob. Quick, quick, quick,

839
00:45:08,645 --> 00:45:10,325
‘Bye.
Alright, bye. Bye-bye.

840
00:45:10,485 --> 00:45:13,565
This all comes down
to my cross-examination.

841
00:45:13,725 --> 00:45:16,205
I need this, Barnyard.

842
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:19,885
Watch in awe as I rediscover
the source of the Nile.

843
00:45:20,045 --> 00:45:23,365
Mr Oakley, you stated under oath
that you never cheated on your wife.

844
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:25,165
Do you still hold to that?

845
00:45:26,165 --> 00:45:29,005
Um, in my heart I never cheated.

846
00:45:29,165 --> 00:45:32,965
That's not the organ
we're focusing on here, Mr Oakley.

847
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:35,245
Let me put the question to you again.

848
00:45:35,405 --> 00:45:41,285
Did you ever place your
membrum virile anywhere near the...

849
00:45:41,445 --> 00:45:45,885
What would the Latin word be?
Um... Oh, of course.

850
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:49,085
..vagina of another woman?

851
00:45:49,245 --> 00:45:53,645
Specifically, were you not paid
a sum of $15,000

852
00:45:53,805 --> 00:45:55,845
to have sex with Alannah Alford

853
00:45:56,005 --> 00:45:59,125
in order that she might conceive
a much-wanted child?

854
00:46:02,085 --> 00:46:03,845
I'm so sorry, Barbara.

855
00:46:04,005 --> 00:46:05,725
I was only doing it
to help them out.

856
00:46:05,885 --> 00:46:08,445
And, I mean, you...you and I,
we weren't communicating.

857
00:46:08,605 --> 00:46:10,405
You were always off
on a golf course somewhere.

858
00:46:10,565 --> 00:46:11,885
Mr Oakley!

859
00:46:12,045 --> 00:46:14,325
But you weren't really
trying to help them, were you?

860
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:16,325
You were just trying to fleece them

861
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:21,805
because you knew very well that
you were incapable of having a child.

862
00:46:21,965 --> 00:46:24,325
What are you talking about?
I've got two children.

863
00:46:24,485 --> 00:46:26,365
Barbara? Barbara?

864
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:28,205
Excuse me.
Barbara?

865
00:46:28,365 --> 00:46:30,165
Just tell them.
Sorry.

866
00:46:30,325 --> 00:46:32,325
Barbara!

867
00:46:35,245 --> 00:46:36,725
Uh...

868
00:46:38,965 --> 00:46:42,045
I put it to you that once you became
aware of your husband's infidelities

869
00:46:42,205 --> 00:46:44,325
you became hell-bent on revenge.

870
00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:47,925
I suggest that you snuck out
of your golf tournament,

871
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:51,205
you drove back to the city,
you jumped the neighbour's fence,

872
00:46:51,365 --> 00:46:54,805
you got the garden shears and
you went about your terrible business.

873
00:46:54,965 --> 00:46:56,525
I did nothing of the sort.

874
00:46:56,685 --> 00:46:58,725
I couldn't have cared less
if he had an affair.

875
00:46:58,885 --> 00:47:00,885
I couldn't bear to be with him.

876
00:47:01,045 --> 00:47:05,325
OK, I know my life is just gonna
be a giant internet joke anyway,

877
00:47:05,485 --> 00:47:06,885
so here itis.

878
00:47:07,045 --> 00:47:09,565
Bob, neither child is yours.

879
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:11,085
I've been having affairs

880
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,365
to break the interminable
boredom of life with you.

881
00:47:13,525 --> 00:47:14,525
Order!

882
00:47:14,685 --> 00:47:16,405
I've been having them for years.

883
00:47:16,565 --> 00:47:18,565
Bob was never a sexual man.

884
00:47:18,725 --> 00:47:20,925
He...he was never
much of a man at all.

885
00:47:21,085 --> 00:47:23,005
I won't have you say that!

886
00:47:23,165 --> 00:47:25,605
Bobby is a sexual dynamo

887
00:47:25,765 --> 00:47:29,005
who made me cross boundaries
that I never thought I could.

888
00:47:29,165 --> 00:47:30,485
You turned to golf

889
00:47:30,645 --> 00:47:33,445
because the tennis girls didn't
trust you with their husbands!

890
00:47:33,605 --> 00:47:35,005
Order!
What are you saying?

891
00:47:35,165 --> 00:47:38,125
Your Honour, I might need
a moment to confer with my client.

892
00:47:38,285 --> 00:47:39,925
And I saw you, Alex.

893
00:47:40,085 --> 00:47:41,765
You were climbing the fence
and holding the shears!

894
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,125
Order!

895
00:47:43,285 --> 00:47:45,805
The next minute, my darling
Bobby had been brutalised.

896
00:47:45,965 --> 00:47:49,125
Well, I finally got some justice!

897
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:51,125
Mrs Alford!
Alannah, did you...

898
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:54,005
If you want it back,
try the wild cats' cage at the zoo.

899
00:47:54,165 --> 00:47:57,645
And for the record,
they didn't find it very satisfying.

900
00:47:57,805 --> 00:47:59,365
Your Honour, uh...

901
00:47:59,525 --> 00:48:01,405
- Oh, forget it.
- Order!

902
00:48:01,565 --> 00:48:04,405
Less the Nile and more shit creek.

903
00:48:10,885 --> 00:48:13,165
So, Barnyard...

904
00:48:14,605 --> 00:48:19,765
..my secretary has, uh, spent
much of the past working week

905
00:48:19,925 --> 00:48:21,885
sobbing into chambers' toilet paper.

906
00:48:22,045 --> 00:48:24,045
Now, normally I'd put that
down to me,

907
00:48:24,205 --> 00:48:26,965
but I do have to ask you, mate —

908
00:48:27,125 --> 00:48:28,805
this mysterious lady

909
00:48:28,965 --> 00:48:33,565
who's been taking you to new horizons
of orgasmic fulfilment,

910
00:48:33,725 --> 00:48:37,365
that wouldn't happen
to be Nicole, would it?

911
00:48:41,445 --> 00:48:43,005
Well done, mate.

912
00:48:43,165 --> 00:48:44,805
Slipped one in before the marriage.

913
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:48,165
I didn't “slip one in”!
I'm not that kind of person.

914
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:49,645
Can't you see?

915
00:48:49,805 --> 00:48:53,845
For me to do something like that,
it's totally significant.

916
00:48:54,005 --> 00:48:56,125
It has to be.

917
00:48:57,445 --> 00:48:59,885
Well, you...

918
00:49:00,045 --> 00:49:03,685
Yeah, well, it makes sense.

919
00:49:03,845 --> 00:49:05,645
I mean, your marriage is shit.

920
00:49:06,645 --> 00:49:09,445
Actually, you guys are perfect
for each other. You're bookends.

921
00:49:09,605 --> 00:49:11,205
It's no wonder the sex was great.

922
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,845
Ordinary, normal people
are great at sex.

923
00:49:15,005 --> 00:49:16,405
It's your big trump card.

924
00:49:16,565 --> 00:49:18,445
It's people like me
who are hit-and-miss.

925
00:49:18,605 --> 00:49:22,285
It's not about sex
and it's never going to be.

926
00:49:22,445 --> 00:49:24,765
So just stay out of it.

927
00:49:24,925 --> 00:49:26,605
Uh-huh.
I mean it, Cleave.

928
00:49:26,765 --> 00:49:28,325
I mean it.

929
00:49:30,325 --> 00:49:34,085
Does she make you happy? Barney?

930
00:49:34,245 --> 00:49:35,965
No.

931
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:38,005
Barney?

932
00:49:38,165 --> 00:49:40,685
She needs to know, mate!

933
00:49:52,005 --> 00:49:53,805
You paid her off, didn't you?

934
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:58,245
Handsomely.

935
00:49:59,845 --> 00:50:04,285
But whatever you think of me,
I don't rape women.

936
00:50:04,445 --> 00:50:07,605
The person in question was
someone I was having a fling with.

937
00:50:07,765 --> 00:50:10,365
I broke up with her,
she got angry...

938
00:50:11,405 --> 00:50:13,645
I suppose I should
have been more careful.

939
00:50:13,805 --> 00:50:15,765
Excuse me if I don't believe you.

940
00:50:15,925 --> 00:50:18,005
I've handed in my resignation.

941
00:50:18,165 --> 00:50:20,765
Well, for the best.

942
00:50:20,925 --> 00:50:23,605
Let's put it down as
an experiment that didn't pay off.

943
00:50:28,805 --> 00:50:31,285
If you think you're gonna
get away with this,

944
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,925
you've got another thing coming.

945
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:37,365
Oh, I wouldn't threaten me.

946
00:50:37,525 --> 00:50:41,365
I'm not sure you hold any
of the picture cards, as we speak.

947
00:51:33,445 --> 00:51:34,765
Come on!

948
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,805
The sooner we get this over with,
the sooner I can go back to bed.

949
00:51:41,005 --> 00:51:42,565
Cleaver.
Yeah.

950
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,165
What are you thinking?
l...

951
00:51:44,325 --> 00:51:46,525
Look, I'm just gonna have
a little chat with the bride.

952
00:51:46,685 --> 00:51:48,005
What about?

953
00:51:48,165 --> 00:51:49,925
I'm not convinced
this is such a good idea.

954
00:51:50,085 --> 00:51:51,605
For God's sake. She's wearing white.

955
00:51:51,765 --> 00:51:53,245
There are two women
carrying her train.

956
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:55,205
It's not the time
for a little chat.

957
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:57,645
My best mate's happiness
is hanging by a thread, alright?

958
00:51:57,805 --> 00:52:00,525
He just needs a little help.
This is the least I can do.

959
00:52:00,685 --> 00:52:02,045
Nicole!

960
00:52:04,485 --> 00:52:07,285
I bloody told you not to interfere!

961
00:52:07,445 --> 00:52:08,965
I'm...I'm doing this for you, mate.

962
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:11,525
No, you're not, you're not.

963
00:52:11,685 --> 00:52:13,325
You're not! Cleaver!

964
00:52:13,485 --> 00:52:16,165
Alright.
Alright?

965
00:52:16,325 --> 00:52:18,805
Alright. OK, OK. Let me up. Oh!

966
00:52:18,965 --> 00:52:21,205
Oh, fuck.
Idiot.

967
00:52:22,485 --> 00:52:24,965
You are.
No, you are.

968
00:52:25,965 --> 00:52:27,285
Nicole!

969
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:28,765
Ohh!

970
00:52:28,925 --> 00:52:31,445
I fucked up your life, mate.
I know I did.

971
00:52:31,605 --> 00:52:34,405
And I feel so terrible about it,
but I can make it right.

972
00:52:34,565 --> 00:52:36,845
I can fix it, alright?

973
00:52:37,005 --> 00:52:38,845
Yeah? Oh, fuck!

974
00:52:39,005 --> 00:52:40,445
Cleaver!
Get fucked!

975
00:52:40,605 --> 00:52:41,925
Oh, yeah?

976
00:52:42,085 --> 00:52:44,765
- Oh!
- Stop it!

977
00:52:44,925 --> 00:52:47,285
Oh, you said that
you loved her, mate.

978
00:52:47,445 --> 00:52:49,885
You said she was the only thing
that made any sense.

979
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:51,925
Nicole!

980
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:55,085
Shut up! Shut up
and listen to me, alright?

981
00:52:55,245 --> 00:52:59,045
I made a mistake.
It was just a root.

982
00:52:59,205 --> 00:53:05,045
I realised I am
that sort of person, OK?

983
00:53:17,205 --> 00:53:20,645
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here today in this place

984
00:53:20,805 --> 00:53:25,445
to celebrate the marriage
of Nicole and Bevan...
