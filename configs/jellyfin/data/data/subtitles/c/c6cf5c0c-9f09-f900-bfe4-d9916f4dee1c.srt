1
00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:04,445
Barney has cancer.

2
00:00:04,565 --> 00:00:07,765
What sort of cancer?
Fuck! Why didn't somebody tell me?

3
00:00:07,885 --> 00:00:11,685
It's the greatest thing that has ever
happened to me. Every day is a blessing.

4
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:13,165
- You were in prison.
- So what?

5
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:16,725
You just decided to steal my secretary
and my entire client base?

6
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:18,885
They want to make a movie
about Josh and me.

7
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:21,925
- Who's 'they'?
- Ron Howard's company.

8
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:24,765
Oh, sh... Tikki!

9
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:26,245
Hello, Cal.

10
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:28,845
Here's what I think we need you to do.

11
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:33,285
You're going to host a new television
program, mostly gambling and scandal.

12
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:36,885
You're my rock. You're my port
in a storm. You're my soulmate.

13
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:38,805
That's just a shipwreck.

14
00:00:40,485 --> 00:00:41,965
Oh, fuck!

15
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:25,805
Why do you think I'm here?

16
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:29,285
I can get any damn QC in the world

17
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:32,885
to make a good argument
and quote the act, chapter and verse.

18
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:37,765
What I need is someone who is prepared
to play beyond the rules,

19
00:01:37,885 --> 00:01:41,885
someone who can say 'mammophile'
without flinching,

20
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,725
someone to bring fireworks to this case.

21
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:47,045
Who can bring the circus
and the carnival to court.

22
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:49,925
I need someone who can bring
top-secret, inadmissible,

23
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:53,365
highly prejudicial evidence
before a jury.

24
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:56,045
Do you think you can do that?

25
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:00,965
Maybe...

26
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:08,245
.if the price is right.

27
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:13,405
For the hundredth time, Clarice,
I don't swing that way.

28
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:16,525
I love you, but only as a friend.
You have to understand that.

29
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:18,965
- I'm in love with Josh.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

30
00:02:19,085 --> 00:02:21,965
I'm off the meth.
I only do coke on weekends.

31
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:24,045
I mean, what more do you want from me?

32
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:31,525
What will it take for you to understand
how I feel about you, Melissa?

33
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:37,365
Clarice,
Melissa and I are getting married.

34
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,045
OK, I'll do it, Josh,
on one condition.

35
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:51,845
What's that?

36
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:55,245
Let me give the bride away.

37
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:10,685
Oh, wasn't Cate just amazing?

38
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:14,805
Oh, yeah. She brought out
my inner lesbian perfectly.

39
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:17,445
- Shall we change the subject?
- What to?

40
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:20,445
- Well, how's your work coming along?
- Great.

41
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:21,925
I'm a legal pariah,

42
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:26,325
and your stupid, fucking film's only
going to make matters worse, isn't it?

43
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:27,805
Next question?

44
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:29,805
Oh, God, look who's here.

45
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:31,285
Is she a pal of yours?

46
00:03:31,405 --> 00:03:34,605
I think one of her companies
may have invested in the film.

47
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:38,365
Yeah, that'd be right. She invests in
a lot of shit, doesn't she?

48
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:43,245
Mm. Hello. Welcome.

49
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:45,325
What are we looking at here?

50
00:03:45,445 --> 00:03:47,365
This is our take on pizza.

51
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:49,965
Our take on pizza?

52
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:51,525
Please don't start.

53
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:55,045
Our take on...
You can't have a take on pizza.

54
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:58,085
Either it is pizza or it isn't,
and this isn't.

55
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:00,845
See this? This is a slice of bread.

56
00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:04,325
There is no pizza doughlike substance
anywhere near this thing.

57
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:07,485
Look, you've got cheese, you've got
some sort of tomato-based sauce.

58
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:09,925
Yeah, but that's not
what makes it a pizza.

59
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:12,965
You can put any old shit you like
on top of the pizza,

60
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,245
make a terrible pizza,
but it's still a pizza,

61
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:17,565
because the thing that makes it a pizza
is the base.

62
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:19,805
And that's why they're called pizzas.

63
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:21,285
Should I get you another drink?

64
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:25,645
I tell you what - I'll get you a drink,
but it'll be my take on white wine,

65
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,125
which is Fanta.

66
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:30,845
Thank you. That's my take on your take.

67
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:33,325
Wonderful. Thank you so much.

68
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:37,725
Welcome.

69
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:41,365
Do you know her?

70
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:43,005
What has got into you?

71
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:46,885
You've turned into
some sort of sexual truffle pig.

72
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:49,885
When this little piggy hasn't had
a truffle for over 12 months,

73
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:53,405
his snout gets very sensitive.

74
00:04:54,405 --> 00:04:55,885
Oh, great.

75
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:59,365
Good evening, Clarice.

76
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:01,725
Oh, stop it!

77
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:04,885
Missy will tell you
that Clarice is an amalgam

78
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,285
of all kinds of characters and ideas,
won't she?

79
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:11,245
Gertrude Stein, Chastity Bono,
Melissa Etheridge.

80
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:13,485
I wouldn't be so cocky, cocky.

81
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:17,005
Your character was described as, quote,
"Totally gaybones'.

82
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:20,405
By your character -
a deranged lesbian meth addict.

83
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:22,085
Please. You guys are making a scene.

84
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:24,565
I'm not the one
the papers are sniggering about, mate.

85
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:26,645
That is right-wing tabloid bullshit.

86
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:28,845
- Oh, I know.
- You want to take this outside?

87
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:30,485
Yes! Let's take the fucker outside.

88
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:31,965
- No!
- Come on!

89
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:34,565
- Yeah!
- No. Nobody is going outside.

90
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:36,605
Everybody is staying in.

91
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:39,845
You are not going to
ruin this night for me.

92
00:05:41,085 --> 00:05:44,365
Yeah, Melissa is right.
We should stay in...

93
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:47,685
..except for Harry, who should come out.

94
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:58,645
I guess that's your take on
'going outside'.

95
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:02,485
Paulie!

96
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:05,045
- Paulie.
- Is that you, Horny? I'm out.

97
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,405
Mate, you've gone through
two bags already. Jesus.

98
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:13,205
Hey, that was you, wasn't it?
Who was the guy who knocked you out?

99
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:16,045
- Exactly.
- You want a line?

100
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:19,045
Oh... You don't even know me, fellas.

101
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:21,045
- Go on, Horny. Give him a line.
- OK, Paulie.

102
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:23,645
- He looks like he could use one.
- Yeah, he does.

103
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:25,645
Then let's go back to the party.

104
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,205
Is the cow still there?

105
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:29,245
Mate, I just saw her leaving,
I swear.

106
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:31,045
- Who's the cow?
- My stepmother.

107
00:06:31,165 --> 00:06:32,525
Tikki Wendon.

108
00:06:32,645 --> 00:06:34,645
You're Tikki Wendon's stepson?

109
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:36,765
God help me. Enjoy.

110
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:53,965
Place your bets.

111
00:06:56,245 --> 00:07:00,045
What you got, Paulie?

112
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:04,565
CROUPIER; Last bets.

113
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:06,525
No more bets.

114
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:08,085
14.

115
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:10,085
14]

116
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:12,485
Thank you, gentlemen.
Stick with me.

117
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:16,285
Stick with me for the evening.
This is as safe as houses.

118
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:18,965
- Well done, sir. Place your bets.
- I love it.

119
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:21,085
That's going right there.
No numbers for you.

120
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:23,085
Come on, now. That's the one.

121
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:27,165
I'd be popping them right there.

122
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:30,005
Popping them right there.
That's where it's going.

123
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:33,525
- Oh! Oh, my God!
- Yes!

124
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:36,245
- It's not bad.
- How much was that?

125
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:38,125
$5,600. Well done, sir.

126
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:39,645
- $5,600.
- New bet.

127
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:42,325
- Place your bets.
- Champagne!

128
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:04,885
The stars were punching
well above their weight last night

129
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:07,765
at the opening
of the new Cate Blanchett movie, Joshua,

130
00:09:07,885 --> 00:09:11,565
based on the life of goodplumbing.com
founder, Joshua Floyd.

131
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:15,405
At the party following the premiere,
a Sydney lawyer, Cleaver Greene,

132
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:19,485
found himself decked by New South Wales
Opposition Leader, David Potter.

133
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:23,045
- Come on, you guys, you'll be late.
- Coming up...

134
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:24,925
- Is Matty ready?
- Yeah.

135
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:27,805
- And where's Rhett?
- Probably wanking.

136
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:30,525
- Summer, don't be disgusting.
- Well, he probably is!

137
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:32,445
That's all he does at the moment.

138
00:09:32,565 --> 00:09:37,765
Well, if that boy is mean to you again,
my darling, you tell Mrs Elms, alright?

139
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:40,685
Because what do we not condone?
We do not condone bullying.

140
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:42,485
Alright, my darling.

141
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:45,565
Thanks, Rhetty.

142
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,045
Right.

143
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:49,485
There you go, sweetheart.

144
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:52,925
Pack it up, troops.

145
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:55,045
We must remember to send Greene
some flowers.

146
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:56,525
Yeah.

147
00:09:56,645 --> 00:10:00,205
Mate, these numbers are fucking gold.
You've got to beat more people up.

148
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:03,525
Have you seen this?
Yeah? Yes.

149
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:07,445
That is much better than
that Tinker Bell bullshit.

150
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,245
What Tinker Bell bullshit?

151
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:11,565
There are a couple of cartoons.

152
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:14,725
- What, with me as...
- Yeah, as Tinker Bell, yeah.

153
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:17,805
I thought I was Harry Potter -
you know, the glasses, the...

154
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:19,725
Online, they moved you to Tinker Bell.

155
00:10:19,845 --> 00:10:22,365
What are they saying?
What does it look like?

156
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:24,245
It's just the glasses...

157
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:25,725
..and the tutu.

158
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:29,605
And a broken wand,
but there was no body per se.

159
00:10:29,725 --> 00:10:33,285
A tutu? A broken wand?

160
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:35,205
Everything's fine now, hey?
Look at this.

161
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:38,005
You don't punch like
you take it up the arse, hey?

162
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,045
- Look at that!
- We're back on this gay thing.

163
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:41,765
It's a Raging Bull quote. It's not gay.

164
00:10:41,885 --> 00:10:44,525
- It's the tabloids.
- You should have ditched the glasses

165
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,525
after Derby Day at Randwick,
like we said. They didn't poll well.

166
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:50,605
Glasses are not gay,
they're just... they're just glasses!

167
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:52,685
I've been wearing them
since primary school.

168
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:54,525
Since when have we been polling glasses?

169
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:58,085
My mum has had the laser.
It's been unbelievable.

170
00:10:58,205 --> 00:11:00,005
The glasses were
a big part of the problem.

171
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,725
That's how the Harry Potter stuff
came up in the first place.

172
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:05,725
Cleaver Greene is how
the fucking Harry Potter stuff came up.

173

♪ PUMPING DANCE MUSIC

174
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,005
Lord, we commend into your hands

175
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,885
the spirit of your servant,
Malcolm John Finnane.

176
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,605
Who are you?

177
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:11,045
- Cleaver Greene.
- Oh.

178
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:14,085
Lord, Malcolm didn't have an easy life.

179
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:16,525
Malcolm told me a lot about you.

180
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,405
Malcolm didn't have an easy life, Lord,
and...

181
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:22,805
- When did you get out?
- Excuse me, young lady.

182
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:25,445
This is a funeral service
for your brother.

183
00:12:25,565 --> 00:12:28,885
- I know, and this is a prayer, right?
- Indeed.

184
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:31,445
So you're talking to God, not me.

185
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,725
You have your conversation.
I'll have mine.

186
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:39,485
This man, unlike you, actually knew
my brother. He was in jail with him.

187
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:43,445
If anyone should be talking about
Malcolm, it should be this man.

188
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:46,205
- He had sex with Malcolm.
- I did not!

189
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:47,685
Malcolm told me you did.

190
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:52,245
Well, Malcolm was a little delusional
in matters of romance.

191
00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:55,765
Come on. A lot of guys do things inside
they wouldn't normally do.

192
00:12:55,885 --> 00:12:59,205
- He wanted to, but it never happened.
- OK, sure.

193
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:02,525
What is wrong with...
Hey, is this about slipping on the soap?

194
00:13:02,645 --> 00:13:06,765
Did he tell you about...
Because I... I... I never slipped...

195
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:08,245
Not in the... I never slipped.

196
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:09,885
He was very explicit.

197
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:12,965
Fantasists tend to be. Jesus Christ.

198
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:16,445
I think we're... we're done here.

199
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:22,925
Ah, in the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, amen.

200
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:28,165
It's called coimetrophobia, by the way.

201
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:29,925
What? What is?

202
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:32,005
Fear of cemeteries.

203
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,605
Do you have death issues?

204
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:36,205
Ah, one or two...

205
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:37,685
..mainly one.

206
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:42,085
It's those left behind who suffer,
Mr Greene, not the dead.

207
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:45,645
Right. So we should fear life
more than we fear death?

208
00:13:45,765 --> 00:13:47,445
- Obviously.
- Ah.

209
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:51,325
I never thought about it like that.
You must be a riot at parties.

210
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:53,965
Ah, I know a lot of dead people.

211
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:56,485
Are you a mortician or something?

212
00:13:56,605 --> 00:14:00,445
Psychologist.
I specialise in addictions.

213
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:03,565
You know - drugs, alcohol, gambling.

214
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:08,005
Ah. That must be fascinating for you.

215
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:12,605
This is what he wanted.

216
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,845
He was very specific.

217
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:20,125
Did he ever talk to you about God?

218
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:22,325
No.

219
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:26,685
All these years,
after everything he's been through,

220
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:31,165
I never understood
how he kept his faith.

221
00:14:34,845 --> 00:14:36,725
I don't have a problem, OK?

222
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:39,845
You lawyers are all the same,
aren't you?

223
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:43,165
You think your class is above
the frailty of others.

224
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:46,605
First of all,
I've been expelled from my class.

225
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:48,925
Alright? Second of all, yes,
I was at a party.

226
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:52,645
Yeah, there may have been
a few sprinkles. What's the big deal?

227
00:14:52,765 --> 00:14:54,845
It wasn't just a few sprinkles,
Cleaver -

228
00:14:54,965 --> 00:14:57,125
it was at least a gram and a half,
maybe two.

229
00:14:57,245 --> 00:15:00,485
That's not work for an amateur.
That takes a seasoned professional.

230
00:15:00,605 --> 00:15:03,365
Are you some sort of a cocaine savant?

231
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:06,925
Call me if you ever want a chat, OK?

232
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:08,845
Yeah, right.

233
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:11,365
Don't throw away a second chance.

234
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:13,325
You're lucky to have one.

235
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:17,645
- See ya.
- OK.

236
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:49,165
Congratulations, Senior Counsel.

237
00:15:49,285 --> 00:15:51,845
- Thank you.
- I'm very proud of you.

238
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:55,085
I hope that doesn't sound condescending.
[t's not meant to.

239
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:57,325
- It doesn't.
- Good.

240
00:15:57,445 --> 00:16:00,325
Ah, thank you. Very kind.

241
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:10,685
Johnny, how's it hanging?

242
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:12,285
Cleaver.

243
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:20,565
Pedro, all good your end?

244
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:22,765
- Cleaver.
- Cleaver.

245
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:28,365
All good my end.

246
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:51,645
Fellas, how's it dangling?

247
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,245
- Cleaver.
- Cleaver.

248
00:16:55,205 --> 00:16:58,205
I told you you could come
to the ceremony, not the house.

249
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:00,045
I couldn't make the ceremony.

250
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:07,405
David, it's over.

251
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:09,285
I know, I know.

252
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,165
Are you out of your mind?

253
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:19,205
Jesus!

254
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:22,285
Open your present.

255
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:26,045
Come on.

256
00:17:30,045 --> 00:17:31,525
Silk for a silk.

257
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:35,245
Congratulations.

258
00:17:52,725 --> 00:17:55,885
Sammy Cox is dealing with
Marcel's side of things, of course,

259
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:57,605
but the salient and little-known fact

260
00:17:57,725 --> 00:18:00,445
is that Laetitia's
selling half of the restaurant.

261
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:03,725
- Are you in, Fred?
- Fucking right I'm in for it.

262
00:18:03,845 --> 00:18:06,005
It's only 150 grand each a pop.

263
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:09,485
For Christ's sake,
you don't get an opportunity like that

264
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:11,845
begging to go down on you every day.

265
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,125
- 150, you say?
- Oh, don't be such a prick.

266
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:17,365
You spend that amount on batteries
for your dildos each month.

267
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:19,485
OK, I'min.

268
00:18:19,605 --> 00:18:22,205
Oh, that's more like it. Anybody else?

269
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:24,805
Marcel's. Marcel's.
I'm trying to remember.

270
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:29,365
It wasn't just the salmonella,
so it wasn't just the puking.

271
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:34,765
It was the sort of incessant tide
of Gallic flim-flam and wankery,

272
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:41,925
the sort of 'noisette Napoléon, cote
de boeuf de Gaulle de pommes de terre'.

273
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:44,925
Steak and chips. Fuck me.

Whoa-ho-ho!

You've forgotten, haven't you?

286
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:01,245
You were so fucking wasted.

287
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:03,685
We were meant to have lunch today,
make the transfer.

288
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:05,205
Make what transfer?

289
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:06,685
Your winnings.

290
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,005
We thought you might
leave them in the back of a cab,

291
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,485
so we looked after them for you.

292
00:20:10,605 --> 00:20:14,525
- What winnings?
- Yeah, you were on fire, mate.

293
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:16,965
- How much did I win?
- 160.

294
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,565
160 bucks?

295
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,805
Grand, mate. 160 grand.

I'm in.

297
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:26,845
Sorry, Cleaver?

298
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:29,405
Marcel's. I'm in. 150 you said, right?

299
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:32,005
I can have a bank cheque for you
tomorrow.

300
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:33,845

00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,845
Ooh, it's looking a little bit tricky,

303
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:45,245
but I'll see if I can squeeze you in,
poppet.

304
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:47,645
No, just doing my job, my love.

305
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:02,165
This is the best move you've ever made.
This will set you up.

306
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:03,925
- Are you back on coke?
- What?

307
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:05,565
Look, you've always told me

308
00:21:05,685 --> 00:21:08,805
not to piss my money up against a wall,
but invest it.

309
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:11,045
Fred is the country's
leading tax lawyer.

310
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:12,885
The man is genetically risk-averse.

311
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:17,085
If you were freezing to death, he would
lease you the steam off his piss

312
00:21:17,205 --> 00:21:18,565
and claim it as a deduction.

313
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:20,045
He knows what he's doing.

314
00:21:20,165 --> 00:21:22,365
So what are you going to live on?

315
00:21:22,485 --> 00:21:26,005
The way I see it,
I've been given a second chance,

316
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,445
and I don't want to blow it, alright?

317
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:30,405
I'm ready to work again.

318
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:35,925
I will live on my earnings, and the
restaurant can be my superannuation.

319
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:41,325
This is inspirational, Cleave.
This is the film they should be making.

320
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:44,765
Darling, why don't you throw a few cases
Cleave's way?

321
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:50,005
Yeah, I could do that if there's
something you might be interested in.

322
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:53,125
Well,
maybe some of the more grisly ones.

323
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:57,525
I know you're a little squeamish.
I could lighten your load.

324
00:21:57,645 --> 00:22:00,325
This would not be about you
lightening my load.

325
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:04,685
This would be about you being
my junior counsel. I'm an SC now.

326
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:06,365
It would be consistent work, Cleave.

327
00:22:06,485 --> 00:22:09,245
Let me remind you that some of us
have been in the legal game

328
00:22:09,365 --> 00:22:10,725
a little longer than others.

329
00:22:10,845 --> 00:22:17,325
Oh, right. Yet miraculously, you're
still a junior counsel. Go figure.

330
00:22:18,365 --> 00:22:21,565
I just think this is fantastic.

331
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:24,085
This is the best day!

332
00:22:24,205 --> 00:22:27,245
I want to celebrate!
I'm going for a run.

333
00:22:27,365 --> 00:22:28,965
What is wrong with you?

334
00:22:29,085 --> 00:22:31,005
- I'm going for a run.
- Who are you?

335
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,565
- You went for a run this morning.
- I'm going to Nicole's.

336
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,365
She needs a hand with something.

337
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:36,845
- You drive to Nicole's!
- Nah!

338
00:22:36,965 --> 00:22:40,325
Barney, you need to rest your body
after chemo.

339
00:22:40,445 --> 00:22:44,205
- Just drive, you fuckwit.
- Why? I'm feeling fine.

340
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:46,005
Hey? I've never felt better. Hey?

341
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:50,045
Come on! Hey, did I tell you
I'm doing the KMA Half Marathon?

342
00:22:50,165 --> 00:22:53,005
- The what?
- The KMA. I'm living, mate!

343
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:56,965
Why don't you do it with me, Cleave?
Come on, come on, embrace life.

344
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,765
Feel the blood pumping!

345
00:22:58,885 --> 00:23:01,805
Oh, yes.
You want to feel my aorta bursting?

346
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:03,685
Come on, do it. Yes? Yes? Is that a yes?

347
00:23:03,805 --> 00:23:05,565
Is that a nod?
Come on, come on, come on...

348
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:09,405
Alright, mate, I'll be there.
I'll come and watch you kill yourself.

349
00:23:09,525 --> 00:23:12,765
But if the doctor says, rest,
you should fucking rest.

350
00:23:12,885 --> 00:23:17,645
You people are soft.
Come on, live a little! Whee!

351
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:21,885
When he's here, he's running to Nicole

352
00:23:22,005 --> 00:23:25,125
and when he's with Nicole,
he's running back here.

353
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:28,165
He's got the gym and the school run,

354
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:32,165
and now he wants to do this...
bloody half marathon.

355
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,885
It's going to kill him.

356
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:36,965
I know it, Nicole knows it.

357
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:40,885
What we don't know is
if he's running away from death

358
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:42,725
or running towards it.

359
00:23:55,565 --> 00:23:57,605
So, Australia,

360
00:23:57,725 --> 00:24:02,685
you think you've seen it all until
you find a piece of work like this.

361
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:06,285
A mother-of-three,
a doctor's receptionist,

362
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:10,925
one Helen Harwood,
shaves her seven-year-old son's head

363
00:24:11,045 --> 00:24:15,565
and tells the world he has cancer,
and she's done it twice,

364
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:20,045
purely in order to scam Medicare
to the tune of $400,000.

365
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:22,645
Now, this is a fraud of such proportions

366
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:26,765
that the Labor Party must be
considering Ms Harwood for preselection.

367
00:24:26,885 --> 00:24:30,525
We've got to crack down on
these welfare fraudsters,

368
00:24:30,645 --> 00:24:32,005
and I know how to.

369
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:35,245
But first,
let's cross to the seventh at Doomben,

370
00:24:35,365 --> 00:24:38,565
where I hear Likely Lad is now at fours.
Tom?

371
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,045
Numbers are holding, mate.

372
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:44,045
Remember, Dave - you're not just
a man's man, but a bloke's bloke.

373
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:45,685
You won't back down.

374
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:50,365
He's not a bloke's bloke, is he?

375
00:24:50,485 --> 00:24:54,925
Now, you call yourself
the Police Commissioner, do you not?

376
00:24:55,045 --> 00:25:00,125
I call you the Commissioner of Death,
the Commissioner of Disgrace,

377
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:02,925
the Commissioner who stands idly by

378
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:06,405
whilst young Australians
and other young people

379
00:25:06,525 --> 00:25:09,885
lucky enough to be allowed to live
in this country are killing each other.

380
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:14,165
You are in effect the
Commissioner of Blood, are you not?

381
00:25:14,285 --> 00:25:17,005
I'm Cal McGregor. We'll be right back.

382
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:20,565
David Potter, thanks for finally
agreeing to come onto the show.

383
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,285
Well, thanks for finally asking me, Cal.

384
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:26,685
So - welfare frauds.

385
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:31,365
You lot basically put out the welcome
mat for them when you were in office.

386
00:25:31,485 --> 00:25:34,605
Medicare is a Federal responsibility,
not State.

387
00:25:34,725 --> 00:25:37,485
I would have thought
even a disgraced former Attorney-General

388
00:25:37,605 --> 00:25:38,965
would have known that.

389
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:42,005
You're willing to put out
the welcome mat for welfare cheats,

390
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,405
yet you're
opposed to infrastructure reform.

391
00:25:44,525 --> 00:25:46,925
Tikki Wendon's superbly imaginative plan

392
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,005
to build an edifice
rivaling the Opera House

393
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:52,605
on the other side of the Harbour -
billions of dollars of investment,

394
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,085
thousands of jobs...

395
00:25:54,205 --> 00:25:56,045
By ‘edifice', you mean ‘casino', right?

396
00:25:56,165 --> 00:25:59,805
Look, I will oppose both the Government
and Tikki Wendon on this,

397
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,445
and I won't back down.

398
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:04,725
My dad shot through
because of his problem with gambling.

399
00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:07,445
Yeah, thanks.
I'm afraid we're out of time.

400
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:11,405
Food for thought, David Potter,
if you're bulimic.

401
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:14,005
Now, the seventh at Dapto's
about to kick off,

402
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:17,645
and I hear Mere Avenger's
looking special. Tom?

403
00:26:17,765 --> 00:26:19,125
We're out, everyone.

404
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,605
Thanks, Potter. That was good.

405
00:26:20,725 --> 00:26:22,965
Hey, listen. Tell me, I'm curious -

406
00:26:23,085 --> 00:26:27,245
what motivates you to get up
and go to work in the morning?

407
00:26:27,365 --> 00:26:31,925
The naive belief that today's
got to be better than yesterday.

408
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:34,325
I'll see you later.

409
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:35,925
Jesus! You right?

410
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,525
Yep, I'm good.

411
00:26:44,365 --> 00:26:47,325
- Is that you, guys?
- Yes, it's us, boss.

412
00:26:47,445 --> 00:26:50,685
- Got to get that laser surgery.
- I'll make the appointment.

413
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:52,165
Fucking poofter.

414
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:55,605
This isn't going to work.
This can't possibly work.

415
00:26:55,725 --> 00:26:58,965
Well, you'd better make it work,
because you need the work.

416
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,205
Anyway, you've been a junior before.

417
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:02,685
Yeah, Not for four years.

418
00:27:02,805 --> 00:27:08,165
And those guys were actually... What's
the word again? Oh, yes - senior to me.

419
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:09,645
I'm not an errand boy.

420
00:27:09,765 --> 00:27:12,485
She's going to want me
to research stuff, find precedents,

421
00:27:12,605 --> 00:27:14,805
read actual judgements and legislature.

422
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:17,885
You know that's not my thing.
She's the prissy, methodical one.

423
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:19,365
She's the one...

424
00:27:19,485 --> 00:27:22,285
Oh, Cleaver,
will you shut up and face reality?

425
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:24,885
- What the fuck is this?
- Reality.

426
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:28,885
Yours is the third room
on the left of reality.

427
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:30,365
You're kidding me.

428
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:34,885
Dump your stuff. Scarlet would like you
for a conference in five.

429
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:36,485
Oh.

430
00:27:37,845 --> 00:27:39,365
Are you kidding me?!

431
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:43,165
Oh, for the love of...

432
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:06,285
Helen Harwood, Scarlet Marx SC.

433
00:28:06,405 --> 00:28:07,765
Engels.

434
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:11,885
Right. Sorry - Engels. Not Marx,
not Lenin. I knew it was one of them.

435
00:28:12,005 --> 00:28:13,365
Don't put me in the gulag!

436
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,365
Hi, I'm Helen. How are you?

437
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:18,325
Scarlet Engels. How do you do?
Please take a seat.

438
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:19,805
Thank you.

439
00:28:19,925 --> 00:28:21,285
And this is Cleaver Greene.

440
00:28:21,405 --> 00:28:24,525
- Hi, I'm Helen. How are you?
- Helen, lovely to meet you.

441
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:27,405
I love to bake.
Nothing like a muffin in the morning.

442
00:28:27,525 --> 00:28:29,405
These are for you, Ms Engels.

443
00:28:29,525 --> 00:28:31,405
- And of course Mr Greene?
- Oh! Yum, yum.

444
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:34,645
And of course Mr Lincoln.
I know how much he likes them.

445
00:28:34,765 --> 00:28:37,685
That's very kind of you, Ms Harwood,
but let's get down to business.

446
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:40,725
Of course.
I know how precious your time is.

447
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:44,005
I hope we can get over this whole
silly misunderstanding.

448
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:46,045
Misunderstanding? Right.

449
00:28:46,165 --> 00:28:51,765
Um, Ms Harwood,
it would appear that you have committed

450
00:28:51,885 --> 00:28:54,285
a complex
and well thought-through fraud

451
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:58,325
which has netted you almost $400,000.

452
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,365
You've claimed reimbursement for
hundreds of medical procedures

453
00:29:01,485 --> 00:29:03,005
for your son which never took place,

454
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:05,965
using your position as
a medical receptionist to an oncologist

455
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:08,485
to forge claim forms and reports.

456
00:29:08,605 --> 00:29:12,565
Yes. There has been some confusion
with the forms.

457
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:16,845
$400,000 does not represent confusion,
Ms Harwood, it represents fraud!

458
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:24,125
OK. Lincoln, why don't you take Helen
downstairs for a jiffy

459
00:29:24,245 --> 00:29:29,365
and get her a nice cup of tea, and
Ms Engels and I will have a little chat?

460
00:29:29,485 --> 00:29:30,965
Of course.

461
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:40,725
OK, not the most auspicious start.

462
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:43,725
- Do you think?
- I don't have to like her.

463
00:29:43,845 --> 00:29:45,205
But you can't hate her.

464
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,725
She has made her little boy pretend
he has cancer. Don't you hate her?

465
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:50,725
You can't hate your clients, Red.

466
00:29:50,845 --> 00:29:54,045
- Why not?
- Because they're your livelihood,

467
00:29:54,165 --> 00:29:59,005
and sometimes - admittedly, rarely -
they are actually innocent.

468
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:03,445
What's worse, occasionally, they turn
out to be better people than we are.

469
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:07,925
- Even some of the guilty ones?
- Especially some of the guilty ones.

470
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:10,765
Now, look,
the woman clearly has a problem.

471
00:30:10,885 --> 00:30:13,645
There's got to be a syndrome out there
we can pin it on.

472
00:30:15,205 --> 00:30:19,005
No, her best chance it to plead guilty
and be full of remorse.

473
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:22,325
Tom Buckingham's running it for the
DPP. We're old mates. We can do a deal.

474
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,365
Is this the way you run your practice -
doing deals with old mates?

475
00:30:25,485 --> 00:30:27,685
What happened to good,
old-fashioned advocacy?

476
00:30:27,805 --> 00:30:29,365
Cleaver, you and I both know

477
00:30:29,485 --> 00:30:32,725
that 95% of the people who come in here
are guilty.

478
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:35,405
The best thing we can do for them
is a deal.

479
00:30:35,525 --> 00:30:37,125
I want you to go out and talk to her

480
00:30:37,245 --> 00:30:39,525
and find something
to help me make that deal.

481
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:42,925
Alright? Priority one -
find out what she's done with the money

482
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:44,405
and if she can give it back.

483
00:30:44,525 --> 00:30:46,085
Off you go.

484
00:30:46,205 --> 00:30:49,045
- Hmm?
- Oh! Oh, yes.

485
00:30:49,165 --> 00:30:50,525
Dismissed, huh?

486
00:30:50,645 --> 00:30:52,165
- Yes?
- Yes, you are.

487
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:54,965
You can send Lincoln back up.
Bon voyage.

488
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:57,925
Jawohl, mein Obergruppenfihrer.

489
00:30:58,045 --> 00:31:01,365
Matty's been so brave,
haven't you, my darling?

490
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,005
Yeah, I'll bet he has.

491
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:06,205
- Where's your cancer, mate?
- Bones, grade-3.

492
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:08,405
Started in my left leg when I was four.

493
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:14,845
I've got to do some homework.

494
00:31:14,965 --> 00:31:17,125
Is that alright, Mr Greene?

495
00:31:17,245 --> 00:31:21,245
Yeah. Actually,
I wouldn't mind a private word, Helen.

496
00:31:21,365 --> 00:31:24,325
Rhett, look after your brother.

497
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:25,925
Alright.

498
00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:38,965
Um...

499
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:44,045
..you know you're looking at five years,
don't you?

500
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:45,845
- Five years?
- Prison.

501
00:31:45,965 --> 00:31:48,525
Prison? I can't go to prison.

502
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:52,405
Right. Well,
Ms Engels is very good at doing deals.

503
00:31:52,525 --> 00:31:55,685
She can probably get it down to two
for you, maybe even one

504
00:31:55,805 --> 00:31:57,325
if you can get the money back.

505
00:31:57,445 --> 00:31:59,085
I told you - I can't go to prison.

506
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:01,085
Can you get the money back?

507
00:32:01,205 --> 00:32:03,125
- Do you hear me?
- Helen.

508
00:32:03,245 --> 00:32:04,685
What have you done with the money?

509
00:32:04,805 --> 00:32:07,285
I don't know anything about any money.

510
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:11,685
OK, look -
this place isn't exactly a palace,

511
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:14,325
and it's got a hefty mortgage.

512
00:32:14,445 --> 00:32:17,325
The kids' school paid for the car.

513
00:32:17,445 --> 00:32:21,365
I don't know.
Have you invested the money somewhere?

514
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:26,485
Did you buy yourself some jewels?
Is there a boat I need to know about?

515
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:30,685
Helen, this has to stop.

516
00:32:30,805 --> 00:32:32,845
Matty doesn't have cancer, does he?

517
00:32:32,965 --> 00:32:34,805
He's a healthy, seven-year-old boy

518
00:32:34,925 --> 00:32:37,885
who should be leading
a healthy, seven-year-old life,

519
00:32:38,005 --> 00:32:39,925
but because of you,
he thinks he's very sick.

520
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:44,725
You're hurting him.
You know that, don't you?

521
00:32:44,845 --> 00:32:46,245
How dare you.

522
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:50,205
I would never hurt him.

523
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:53,165
I love him
more than anything in the world.

524
00:32:53,285 --> 00:32:55,285
- What have you done with the money?
- Get out.

525
00:32:55,405 --> 00:32:58,245
- We don't have time for...
- I said, get out!

526
00:32:58,365 --> 00:32:59,845
OK, OK.

527
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:03,965
But...

528
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:17,725
Psst!

529
00:33:17,845 --> 00:33:19,325
Frog and Gnome.

530
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:27,349
http://hiqve.com/

531
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:44,485
The Congo is just so far!

532
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,285
Yeah, I think that's part of the point,
Mum.

533
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:49,765
There's enough poor people here
to go around, surely.

534
00:33:49,885 --> 00:33:51,685
Why have you got to go
all the way to Africa?

535
00:33:51,805 --> 00:33:53,445
That's where the mission's sending us.

536
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,885
Why can't the mission
send you to Brisbane?

537
00:33:56,005 --> 00:33:58,085
There are poor people in Brisbane.

538
00:33:58,205 --> 00:34:01,285
It's just an hour away.
We could visit you there.

539
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:03,005
Mum, my bag is too small.

540
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,685
- I told you that when we were shopping.
- I know, I know.

541
00:34:05,805 --> 00:34:09,525
Alright, take mine. It's in my wardrobe.
Back left-hand side.

542
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:13,605
I can remember being desperate
to go to London when I was a girl.

543
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:17,245
My father went on a long business trip
there,

544
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:22,525
and he brought me back
the most beautiful doll from Harrods.

545
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:25,205
It was the most exquisite thing.

546
00:34:25,325 --> 00:34:26,925
Fuzz!

547
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:28,525
Wendy?

548
00:34:34,645 --> 00:34:36,045
You know the Dicksons?

549
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:39,885
Well, they're having a party,
and we all had to bring something.

550
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:41,485
Mum?

551
00:34:44,605 --> 00:34:48,205
Darling, this is Ruth. She's...

552
00:34:49,325 --> 00:34:51,925
She's something that...

553
00:34:52,045 --> 00:34:54,165
She watches.

554
00:34:54,285 --> 00:34:58,245
She... We don't do anything with her,
she's just...

555
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:00,085
You've heard of voyeurism, haven't you?

556
00:35:00,205 --> 00:35:05,605
Yeah, but isn't the defining element
of voyeurism being able to see?

557
00:35:05,725 --> 00:35:08,685
- If she's watching, then who...
- Roger likes to be watched.

558
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:10,325
He likes to be watched by that?

559
00:35:10,445 --> 00:35:11,925
Yeah.

560
00:35:14,325 --> 00:35:16,405
OK.

561
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:18,285
OK?

562
00:35:18,405 --> 00:35:19,805
- You sure?
- Yeah.

563
00:35:19,925 --> 00:35:24,245
I was just thinking
of what Dad would say if he found out.

564
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:32,605
OK, what are your terms?

565
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:37,125
Well, I just think Tara and I would be
better prepared for the Congo if...

566
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:39,245
..if we flew business class.

567
00:35:43,005 --> 00:35:44,765
Helen?

568
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:47,925
Oh, Helen.

569
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:52,405
Rhett! I told you not to open the door.

570
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,885
- It's over, Mum.
- What are you talking about?

571
00:35:56,005 --> 00:36:00,965
Look, I went up to the Frog and Gnome
and had a word with Bill up there.

572
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:05,445
That's a good, old pub, isn't it?

573
00:36:05,565 --> 00:36:08,245
Please, not in front of the children.

574
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:12,085
Summer and I know, Mum.
Do you think we're fucking idiots?

575
00:36:12,205 --> 00:36:17,085
Look, Helen, Bill seems to think
it's probably more like $500,000

576
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:20,565
you've put through his pokies
over time.

577
00:36:37,005 --> 00:36:38,685
Good evening, sir.

578
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:41,445
Good evening.

579
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:46,365
I happen to be a significant shareholder
in this establishment,

580
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:51,925
so my first question to you is,
where the fuck is everybody?

581
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:56,845
Well, it's a Friday, sir.
Not much traffic on Friday.

582
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,765
Oh, not much traffic on a Friday?

583
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:01,085
No, sir.

584
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:03,005
- Felicity.
- Cleaver.

585
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:07,805
We'll be talking more, my friend.

586
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,405
- The answer's no.
- I don't get it.

587
00:37:10,525 --> 00:37:14,445
The woman's an addict.
More than that, she's a victim.

588
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,765
She's poured hundreds of thousands
of dollars into these pokies.

589
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:21,245
This is the problem. It's people like
you who give addiction a bad name.

590
00:37:21,365 --> 00:37:24,965
It's who like me who what?

591
00:37:25,085 --> 00:37:28,205
'l cheated on my wife 20 times.
Boohoo. I'm a sex addict.'

592
00:37:28,325 --> 00:37:33,285
"This is my fifth drink-driving charge.
Boohoo. I'm an alcoholic.'

593
00:37:33,405 --> 00:37:37,565
'Don't judge me, society, help me.
I'm a victim." Please.

594
00:37:37,685 --> 00:37:40,125
This woman should go to jail
and do a rehab program.

595
00:37:40,245 --> 00:37:42,805
I've got no interest in helping her.

596
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:44,525
Wow.

597
00:37:44,645 --> 00:37:49,765
Oh, and just for the record, I hear the
duck here is a little on the dry side.

598
00:37:49,885 --> 00:37:55,005
Hey, don't start saying things
about the duck you're going to regret.

599
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,885
I think you're a coward.

600
00:37:57,005 --> 00:37:58,765
Oh, yeah. You talk big,

601
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:02,445
but when the opportunity actually arises
to do something...

602
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:04,645
Do what, exactly?

603
00:38:04,765 --> 00:38:08,605
This isn't just about Helen Harwood.

604
00:38:08,725 --> 00:38:14,085
Imagine the message that would be sent
if a jury were to find someone else

605
00:38:14,205 --> 00:38:17,885
ultimately responsible for
Helen's crimes.

606
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:21,125
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

607
00:38:21,245 --> 00:38:25,045
My motives might be a little less subtle
than yours,

608
00:38:25,165 --> 00:38:28,285
but we can take the fuckers on.

609
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:30,565
You want to take on the gambling lobby?

610
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:32,925
I do.

611
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:37,125
See? I'm full of surprises.

612
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:44,205
Tell me, how long is it
since you've actually had sex?

613
00:38:46,045 --> 00:38:47,645
An eternity.

614
00:38:54,885 --> 00:38:57,165
I can be full of surprises too.

615
00:39:07,205 --> 00:39:10,325
One year.
Daily rehab classes, of course,

616
00:39:10,445 --> 00:39:14,005
and after six months,
you get to go home for weekends.

617
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:15,645
I'm not going to jail.

618
00:39:15,765 --> 00:39:18,325
Helen, under the circumstances,
I have to advise you,

619
00:39:18,445 --> 00:39:20,245
this is a very good deal.

620
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,725
Is it my choice?

621
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:26,205
Yes.

622
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:29,725
Then no. Thank you.
It's very sweet of you,

623
00:39:29,845 --> 00:39:31,605
and I know you must have worked
very hard.

624
00:39:31,725 --> 00:39:36,565
Helen, if you don't take this deal
and we lose, you could get five years.

625
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:41,405
Mr Greene said that I could get off
without doing any time at all.

626
00:39:41,525 --> 00:39:45,765
Ah, yes. Well, what I actually said was

627
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:50,925
that if Ms Engels says that you will
do a year, then you will do a year,

628
00:39:51,045 --> 00:39:56,565
whereas if you go my way,
you'll either probably do no time at all

629
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,765
or you'll do the full five-year stretch.

630
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:03,605
Right.

631
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:10,005
So, this is what
you're instructing me to plead.

632
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:13,845
You are a victim
of the gambling industry,

633
00:40:13,965 --> 00:40:19,125
which drove you to pretend that
your seven-year-old son has cancer.

634
00:40:19,245 --> 00:40:22,645
That is what I'm instructing you
to plead.

635
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:28,525
Ms Engels,
you haven't even touched your muffin.

636
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:31,085
I know how much you like blueberry.

637
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:37,405
So, well done.

638
00:40:37,525 --> 00:40:39,965
The first case I throw you,
you make me look like an idiot.

639
00:40:40,085 --> 00:40:42,525
- Come on, Red.
- I send you to do a little groundwork.

640
00:40:42,645 --> 00:40:44,885
- You turn my client against me.
- Our client.

641
00:40:45,005 --> 00:40:48,365
All prosecution needs
are a few parents on the jury,

642
00:40:48,485 --> 00:40:51,885
and our client is going to spend
the next five years of her life in jail.

643
00:40:52,005 --> 00:40:55,285
It's all high risk for your high stakes,
isn't it? It's all about the rush.

644
00:40:55,405 --> 00:40:57,765
Has the last year taught you nothing?

645
00:40:57,885 --> 00:40:59,485
She doesn't want to go to jail.

646
00:40:59,605 --> 00:41:01,125
Oh! Well, that's a novel defence.

647
00:41:01,245 --> 00:41:03,605
"Your Honour,
my client doesn't want to go to jail."

648
00:41:03,725 --> 00:41:06,325
'Oh, really, Ms Engels?
Well, you leave me with no choice.

649
00:41:06,445 --> 00:41:08,525
The prisoner is free
to go back out into the world

650
00:41:08,645 --> 00:41:10,965
and pretend her daughter
has the fucking plague!

651
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,285
Thank you, Your Honour.

652
00:41:16,405 --> 00:41:20,005
Your Honour, since the installation
of poker machines in the Frog and Gnome

653
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:22,765
some three years ago, my client has...

654
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:27,085
..has put $500,000
through those machines.

655
00:41:27,205 --> 00:41:30,805
I'm aware, Ms Engels.
What are you suggesting?

656
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:33,165
Is this going to be
some sort of plea in mitigation,

657
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:38,205
or are you embarking
on some bizarre causative frolic?

658
00:41:38,325 --> 00:41:42,885
Maybe Your Honour could give me a moment
to seek further and...

659
00:41:43,005 --> 00:41:45,005
Excuse me, Your Honour.

660
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:50,205
With the greatest respect,
perhaps my junior, Mr Greene, could...

661
00:42:12,285 --> 00:42:17,725
Your Honour, if I could beg
the court's indulgence for one moment.

662
00:42:22,325 --> 00:42:25,045
How many addicts do we have
in the jury over there?

663
00:42:25,165 --> 00:42:26,525
Two I'm pretty certain of.

664
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:29,165
The girl in the pink
is spending every cent she has on blow,

665
00:42:29,285 --> 00:42:32,245
and the guy in the plaid
loves the ponies, I think.

666
00:42:32,365 --> 00:42:34,005
A couple of alcos, maybe.

667
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:35,885
Mr Greene!

668
00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:40,165
Your Honour, I do beg your pardon.

669
00:42:41,605 --> 00:42:44,925
Ladies and gentlemen,

670
00:42:45,045 --> 00:42:50,965
you sit today in judgement
of your fellow human being.

671
00:42:51,085 --> 00:42:54,325
That is a heavy burden, isn't it?

672
00:42:54,445 --> 00:42:56,805
Does not the Bible say,

673
00:42:56,925 --> 00:43:02,125
"Judge not lest ye be judged," hmm?

674
00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:05,725
You will come to know my client,
Helen Harwood,

675
00:43:05,845 --> 00:43:08,925
as a doting mother-of-three.

676
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:14,205
Now, she does not deny that
she has committed some terrible acts,

677
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:18,365
but what we must determine here today
in this court

678
00:43:18,485 --> 00:43:21,725
is what drove my client
to commit these acts.

679
00:43:21,845 --> 00:43:23,365
What is the root cause?

680
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:29,725
The scourge of gambling
is a multibillion-dollar industry

681
00:43:29,845 --> 00:43:35,845
that makes its massive profits
from seducing vulnerable folk

682
00:43:35,965 --> 00:43:38,645
such as my client.

683
00:43:38,765 --> 00:43:43,045
I never really gambled
before the pub put the machines in.

684
00:43:43,165 --> 00:43:46,165
It started out as just the odd flutter,
you know,

685
00:43:46,285 --> 00:43:49,725
but soon I couldn't stop myself.

686
00:43:49,845 --> 00:43:52,845
I took out a second mortgage
on the house,

687
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:55,165
but that was gone in a few months.

688
00:43:55,285 --> 00:43:57,165
I tried to stop.

689
00:43:57,285 --> 00:44:01,285
Every day I'd say, 'Not today."

690
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:05,165
But... then I'd see the ads
on the telly, you know,

691
00:44:05,285 --> 00:44:07,285
for the gambling websites.

692
00:44:07,405 --> 00:44:09,045
They're everywhere.

693
00:44:10,765 --> 00:44:15,445
I'd walk past the pub
and... I could hear the machines.

694
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:20,205
It was like they were calling me.

695
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:26,765
Apologies, Your Honour.
Might I take a moment?

696
00:44:26,885 --> 00:44:29,125
Yes, Ms Engels.

697
00:44:29,245 --> 00:44:32,005
Do you think that
she may have poisoned me?

698
00:44:32,125 --> 00:44:35,165
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would she do that?

699
00:44:35,285 --> 00:44:37,005
I think it was the mu...

700
00:44:38,605 --> 00:44:40,085
The muffin.

701
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:43,645
The blueberry muffin? No.

702
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:48,965
I thought the blueberry muffins
were your favourite type of muffin.

703
00:44:54,285 --> 00:44:56,365
Now, where were we?

704
00:44:56,485 --> 00:45:01,085
Mr Short, when was the first time
that you saw my client in your pub?

705
00:45:01,205 --> 00:45:04,165
- I can't recall.
- You did meet her, did you not?

706
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:05,645
Yeah, I did, on many occasions.

707
00:45:05,765 --> 00:45:07,965
So you knew that she had children,

708
00:45:08,085 --> 00:45:10,925
one of whom,
to all intents and purposes, had cancer?

709
00:45:11,045 --> 00:45:14,405
- Yeah, I did.
- Yet you did nothing to discourage her

710
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:17,125
from pouring hundreds of thousands
of dollars

711
00:45:17,245 --> 00:45:18,845
into the machines at your pub?

712
00:45:18,965 --> 00:45:20,525
It's a free country.

713
00:45:20,645 --> 00:45:26,005
In fact, far from discouraging her,
you actually offered her inducements

714
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:29,205
to play the pokies at the
Frog and Gnome, didn't you, Mr Short?

715
00:45:29,325 --> 00:45:30,925
- Inducements?
- Yes.

716
00:45:31,045 --> 00:45:34,085
Did you offer her...
free food and drink?

717
00:45:34,205 --> 00:45:35,565
Yeah, sometimes.

718
00:45:35,685 --> 00:45:39,365
Did you extend her a line of credit
at all?

719
00:45:39,485 --> 00:45:43,285
- Occasionally, yeah.
- Under what circumstances?

720
00:45:43,405 --> 00:45:45,205
Well, usually, it was after we'd rooted.

721
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,605
I beg your pardon?

722
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:52,005
We had an arrangement.
We rooted, what, 20 or 30 times?

723
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:55,405
I'd extend her a little credit
for the, um, pokies.

724
00:45:57,525 --> 00:45:59,125
Yes.

725
00:45:59,245 --> 00:46:03,525
Yes. And, and...
What can I say, ladies and gentlemen?

726
00:46:03,645 --> 00:46:05,845
Such was my client's desperation,

727
00:46:05,965 --> 00:46:09,125
and such is the greed of proprietors
such as Mr Short here

728
00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:10,805
and his corporate masters

729
00:46:10,925 --> 00:46:14,005
that they will relentlessly exploit
the vulnerability of such people

730
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:15,685
and drive them to acts of debasement.

731
00:46:15,805 --> 00:46:19,885
- Mr Greene!
- Yeah, no, apologies, Your Honour.

732
00:46:22,085 --> 00:46:23,565
Where were we?

733
00:46:23,685 --> 00:46:27,645
Well, ah,
Mr Short here was just detailing

734
00:46:27,765 --> 00:46:30,445
how he regularly paid Helen for sex.

735
00:46:48,525 --> 00:46:50,485
Justice has been done.

736
00:46:50,605 --> 00:46:54,885
The gambling industry
preys on the frailties of the weak,

737
00:46:55,005 --> 00:46:59,965
but now I'm strong,
and I'm very pleased to be able to say

738
00:47:00,085 --> 00:47:03,925
this is the first day
of the rest of my life.

739
00:47:04,045 --> 00:47:10,165
I'd like to thank my legal team,
headed up by Mr Cleaver Greene,

740
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:15,885
for never wavering and for always
having faith in my case. Thank you.

741
00:47:16,005 --> 00:47:18,445
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

742
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:25,885
Celebration?

743
00:47:26,005 --> 00:47:28,005
What would we be celebrating?

744
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:31,925
Well, we kicked the gambling industry
in the arse, didn't we?

745
00:47:32,045 --> 00:47:34,125
You kicked a pub in the arse, Cleaver,

746
00:47:34,245 --> 00:47:37,965
or rather, a sleazy publican
kicked himself in the arse

747
00:47:38,085 --> 00:47:39,845
and created a bit of a stink.

748
00:47:39,965 --> 00:47:42,085
If that's what you were after,
congratulations.

749
00:47:42,205 --> 00:47:45,685
Wow, you're really
a bit of a mood killer, aren't you?

750
00:47:45,805 --> 00:47:48,605
Malcolm told me
you were an advocate for social justice.

751
00:47:48,725 --> 00:47:52,765
Yeah, I am, when I can be.

752
00:47:52,885 --> 00:47:55,645
Maybe just when you need to be. See ya.

753
00:47:55,765 --> 00:48:00,165
I'm prepared to stump up for
a bottle of champagne.

754
00:48:00,285 --> 00:48:03,045
- French, of course.
- Oh, I'm sure you are.

755
00:48:03,165 --> 00:48:07,805
Any spurious pretext will do, won't it?
Probably get some sprinkles too.

756
00:48:09,805 --> 00:48:13,685
What are you,
in the Women's Temperance League?

757
00:48:15,645 --> 00:48:17,405
Wendy, Fuzz?

758
00:48:17,525 --> 00:48:19,685
Where is everybody?

759
00:48:22,405 --> 00:48:23,765
I've had a win.

760
00:48:23,885 --> 00:48:25,405
Hello. Can I help you?

761
00:48:25,525 --> 00:48:28,725
Oh, are you a friend of Wendy's?
Where's Wendy?

762
00:48:28,845 --> 00:48:31,845
Fuzz's farewell.
Are you a friend of Fuzzy's?

763
00:48:31,965 --> 00:48:36,245
Wendy and Roger have moved.
I have an address somewhere.

764
00:48:37,245 --> 00:48:38,805
Oh, shit.

765
00:48:40,805 --> 00:48:43,285
I'm sorry about the mess.

766
00:48:43,405 --> 00:48:44,965
Wow.

767
00:48:45,085 --> 00:48:46,565
They've really...

768
00:48:49,285 --> 00:48:50,765
Fuzzy's...

769
00:48:52,685 --> 00:48:55,205
Wow. Fuck.

770
00:48:56,365 --> 00:48:58,525
Good evening, children.

771
00:48:59,525 --> 00:49:00,885
Fuck.

772
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:04,845
You've really gone to town here,
haven't you?

773
00:49:04,965 --> 00:49:08,005
This was my marital home once.

774
00:49:12,485 --> 00:49:16,245
You know how I got the deposit
for this place?

775
00:49:16,365 --> 00:49:19,845
A bay mare called Wide Margin.

776
00:49:19,965 --> 00:49:25,125
I remember I went up to the members
and shouted the bar.

777
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:30,085
That was a huge win, like, 40, 50 to 1.

778
00:49:30,205 --> 00:49:34,125
Unexpectedly slow track, you see?

779
00:49:37,485 --> 00:49:43,805
Wendy and I went home
and made love to Miles Davis,

780
00:49:43,925 --> 00:49:45,805
Blue In Green.

781
00:49:45,925 --> 00:49:50,445
She was so fucking beautiful.

782
00:49:51,765 --> 00:49:54,485
Fucking beautiful girl.

783
00:49:54,605 --> 00:49:57,685
She is. She is a beautiful girl.

784
00:50:01,245 --> 00:50:04,365
I told her
I'd never bet again after that.

785
00:50:06,085 --> 00:50:09,045
Um, I have the address here.

786
00:50:11,765 --> 00:50:13,245
Blue In Green.

787
00:51:01,485 --> 00:51:04,965
This is
the Department of Community Services.

788
00:51:05,085 --> 00:51:09,365
We have a court order to take
three children into protective custody.

789
00:51:09,485 --> 00:51:10,965
Open up, please.

790
00:51:13,005 --> 00:51:16,565
Is there a parent or guardian at home?

791
00:51:16,685 --> 00:51:20,165
Um, just me and my brother and sister.

792
00:51:54,965 --> 00:51:56,325
Oh, no.

793
00:51:56,445 --> 00:52:00,205
Oh, no. I did not mean, "reply all"
I did not mean, reply all'

794
00:52:01,325 --> 00:52:03,085
Oh, fuck!

795
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:27,045
What the fuck is this?

796
00:52:27,165 --> 00:52:29,365
Where'd you get all this money?

797
00:52:29,485 --> 00:52:31,285
I didn't get this money.

798
00:52:32,285 --> 00:52:36,085
I contributed a little bit,
but this is mainly Roger's.

799
00:52:36,205 --> 00:52:37,565
He's an osteopath!

800
00:52:37,685 --> 00:52:42,045
How many dodgy groins do you have to
feel up to get a shack like this?

801
00:52:42,165 --> 00:52:44,285
Or what, has he got family money?

802
00:52:44,405 --> 00:52:47,525
He isn't just an osteopath, Cleave.
He's a sports therapist.

803
00:52:47,645 --> 00:52:50,125
He's a consultant. It's a business.

804
00:52:50,245 --> 00:52:54,325
Consultant, yeah. Consultant
licensed to charge four times more.

805
00:52:54,445 --> 00:52:56,645
OK, do you want to ruin tonight?

806
00:52:56,765 --> 00:53:00,845
Our son is going to the fucking Congo.
This isn't Fiji, Cleaver.

807
00:53:00,965 --> 00:53:03,285
I want you to contemplate that.

808
00:53:06,645 --> 00:53:08,005
Stop it!

809
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:10,125
Dad, come on. Stop it!

810
00:53:10,245 --> 00:53:11,925
Rog! Roger?

811
00:53:12,045 --> 00:53:15,085
Roger's so strong, isn't he? So virile.

812
00:53:17,405 --> 00:53:19,045
She was my wife first.

813
00:53:19,165 --> 00:53:23,685
You are never to see her again,
you understand me?

814
00:53:23,805 --> 00:53:25,325
Fuck you, groin boy.

815
00:53:27,685 --> 00:53:32,485
And you're never to set foot
in this house again. Got it?

816
00:53:32,605 --> 00:53:37,165
He's been in prison a long time, Rog.
I'm sure he's had worse.

817
00:53:48,165 --> 00:53:50,565
How do you think he's doing?

818
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:55,805
I think if he doesn't stop this madness
soon, he's going to die.

819
00:53:55,925 --> 00:53:57,285
I agree.

820
00:53:57,405 --> 00:54:00,005
So I've been thinking...

821
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:03,245
..why don't you move in with us?

822
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,885
- What?
- He's got to stop running.

823
00:54:06,005 --> 00:54:09,925
There's nothing to run to or from
if we're together.

824
00:54:10,925 --> 00:54:12,405
It's the only way.

825
00:54:14,645 --> 00:54:16,125
You're right, yep.

826
00:54:20,325 --> 00:54:22,485
Oh, my God.

827
00:54:25,685 --> 00:54:28,085
Ah. Yeah.

828
00:54:30,805 --> 00:54:32,525
What are you doing here?

829
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:35,925
KMA Half Marathon, apparently, mate.

830
00:54:36,045 --> 00:54:37,565
You're off your tree.

831
00:54:37,685 --> 00:54:40,405
No, I'm not. Come on. Come on.
I told you I was going to do it.

832
00:54:40,525 --> 00:54:42,285
You don't want to do this.

833
00:54:42,405 --> 00:54:44,325
- Yes, I do, mate.
- No, you don't.

834
00:54:44,445 --> 00:54:46,045
Come on, you bald tool.

835
00:54:47,645 --> 00:54:50,045
Come on. Come on, baby. Yeah!

836
00:54:52,525 --> 00:54:55,125
Come on. Come on, Barn.
What are you doing?

837
00:54:56,605 --> 00:54:58,205
Come on!

838
00:55:00,045 --> 00:55:01,525
What's up?

839
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:04,205
I can't, mate.

840
00:55:04,325 --> 00:55:07,205
Come on, mate. I had it in the bag.

841
00:55:12,325 --> 00:55:14,605
I'm scared shitless, Cleave.

842
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:26,845
Come on, Barnyard.

843
00:55:32,925 --> 00:55:34,285
You'll be alright.

844
00:55:34,405 --> 00:55:36,245
I promise you.
