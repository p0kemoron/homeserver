1
00:00:42,286 --> 00:00:46,446
You know when the carpaccio's
just an hour past its prime?

2
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:48,926
It's not off but it's tired.
Yeah.

3
00:00:49,086 --> 00:00:51,806
Yeah, well, that pretty much
set the tone for the whole meal,

4
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:56,326
right up to the catastrophe
they call the tiramisu.

5
00:00:56,486 --> 00:00:59,366
Well, Morley's has always been crap.
You know how bad it is.

6
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,046
We used to go there
for children's birthday parties.

7
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:04,166
Yeah. Well,
you chose to have kids.

8
00:01:04,326 --> 00:01:05,646
2WE!

9
00:01:05,806 --> 00:01:07,566
And I'm joined in the studio

10
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:10,566
by State Attorney-General
Joe Sandilands.

11
00:01:10,726 --> 00:01:13,126
My first question to you,
Attorney-General, is

12
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:15,886
are you a complete moron?

13
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:20,166
Um... And, er,
hello to you too, Eddie.

14
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:23,606
Because that does seem to be
the prevailing mood out there

15
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:25,206
in our city of fear.

16
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:27,446
This government seems unwilling

17
00:01:27,606 --> 00:01:30,726
to bridle the escalating
ethnic gang violence.

18
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:34,446
Asian, Muslim youths
are terrorising our streets.

19
00:01:34,606 --> 00:01:36,606
Well, that is clearly untrue, Eddie.

20
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:39,206
Let's talk about Mary Drouin.
OK.

21
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,646
An innocent young Australian girl

22
00:01:41,806 --> 00:01:45,486
gang-raped by Muslim youths
in broad daylight.

23
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:47,966
I visited Mary just this week
in hospital,

24
00:01:48,126 --> 00:01:51,926
and she is suffering extensive
bruising, external and internal,

25
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:53,606
some of which will last a lifetime.

26
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:56,486
No, well, this is...
It's not just Mary Drouin, is it?

27
00:01:56,646 --> 00:02:01,806
Four other young Australian women
have been raped in this one suburb

28
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:05,206
in this last 4-month period alone.

29
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:08,566
Still no arrests.
Well, if I could just get a word in.

30
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:10,166
Yeah, but words are all we get.

31
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:13,046
I see you call for calm,
but that's all we see you doing.

32
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:15,046
And we're not calm, we are angry

33
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:20,286
because this government has turned
suburbs like Cabramatta and Lakemba

34
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:23,126
into safe havens for baby Taliban.

35
00:02:23,286 --> 00:02:24,726
What? I beg your pardon!

36
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:28,926
When was the last time you walked
the streets of these suburbs?

37
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:30,926
When was the last time
YOU did, Eddie?

38
00:02:31,086 --> 00:02:33,606
Well, I don't think a Western woman
would really feel safe

39
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:35,606
in those areas
without a full burqa on.

40
00:02:35,766 --> 00:02:37,726
I wouldn't go down there
without a .22 automatic.

41
00:02:37,886 --> 00:02:41,926
But given that I'm not allowed to
defend myself in such a manner,

42
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:44,166
I have to rely on my
government.

43
00:02:44,326 --> 00:02:46,566
If you would just give me a chance
to answer, Eddie, I'd...

44
00:02:46,726 --> 00:02:50,806
But honestly, I mean, if I was a
young man with a sister or a mother

45
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:53,006
or, God forbid,
an adolescent daughter,

46
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,606
I know what I'd be doing.

47
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,526
Eddie, look, that is
completely inappropriate.

48
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:58,086
You have made this war.

49
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:02,446
You are forcing brave young people
to take up cudgels,

50
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:06,646
to go into these areas and to
take the law into their own hands —

51
00:03:06,806 --> 00:03:09,806
and who can blame them, really —
calling “No more Mary Drouins!”

52
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:12,286
This jihad against Australian women

53
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:15,246
must stop one way or another
right now.

54
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:17,966
Now, you are advocating
vigilantism here.

55
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:20,246
Thank you, Attorney-General.

56
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:22,286
And that was
Attorney-General Joe Sandilands,

57
00:03:22,446 --> 00:03:23,766
once again...

58
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:27,766
..unable to shed any light
on our streets of fear.

59
00:03:29,406 --> 00:03:31,006
- Oi!
- Had it from this guy!

60
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,406
Oi, you, you fucking dogs!
Who the fuck is that?!

61
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:35,646
You wanna go? I wanna stay.
Come on! Come on!

62
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:37,366
Who the fuck are they?
Come on!

63
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:38,526
Who cares, hey?

64
00:03:42,326 --> 00:03:47,486
You're listening to Eddie
Longhorn, Drivetime, 2WE, 9:66am.

65
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,486
Just go, go, go!
You!

66
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:57,646
Run!

67
00:04:13,926 --> 00:04:15,246
Straighten it out. Oi!

68
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:17,766
Oil
MAN: Go on, bro!

69
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:24,606
23-29 to base, we need
an ambulance here right away.

70
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:32,630
http://hiqve.com/

71
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:37,126
Who's Warwick Torrens?

72
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:41,526
He is the Director
of Public Prosecutions.

73
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:43,766
Why do you ask?
He called.

74
00:04:43,926 --> 00:04:45,526
What did he want?

75
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,566
Hmm, my guess is
he wanted to speak to you.

76
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:56,166
Hey!

77
00:04:56,326 --> 00:04:57,966
You slept here, didn't you?

78
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:02,646
That depends. Where is here?

79
00:05:02,806 --> 00:05:04,326
You are due in court.

80
00:05:04,486 --> 00:05:07,806
Harry-sorry-David and the tax office
await the pleasure of your company.

81
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:09,486
Yes, I'm onto it.

82
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:11,206
So you know Darver's
coming back tomorrow.

83
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:12,766
We have to vacate his room.

84
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:15,006
Is Darver giving up smoking?

85
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:20,246
I've gotta get to Ali, fast.

86
00:05:25,606 --> 00:05:28,086
Hey, that is Darver's gown.

87
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:32,086
Morning!

88
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:36,046
How is the, er... How's the family?

89
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:39,446
Oh, hello.
Er, Edwina Langhorn?

90
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,446
For God's sake, call me Eddie.
What's up?

91
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:44,966
Er, we've got orders to place you
under arrest, if that's alright.

92
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:46,646
Yeah, um...
Really?!

93
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:50,566
Well, I guess there must be
a charge of some kind.

94
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,046
Oh, er, right, yeah.
The charge.

95
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:57,286
Um, sorry. Er, causing a riot,
um, inciting racial vilification.

96
00:05:57,446 --> 00:05:59,326
Oh, dear, I have been busy.

97
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:02,046
There's, er, no need for handcuffs.
We'll just head on out.

98
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:05,206
Oh, no, no, no, I insist. I wouldn't
like you to get into any trouble.

99
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,246
Right, OK.

100
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:09,966
Just mind the Rolex.
Sure.

101
00:06:16,846 --> 00:06:19,006
Why are you still
bloody doing legal work

102
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,046
when you've got a campaign to run?

103
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:23,366
It's my very last case, I promise.

104
00:06:23,526 --> 00:06:25,966
Mate, the party's smiling on you —

105
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:29,286
smiles all around,
happy smiling faces —

106
00:06:29,446 --> 00:06:31,166
but there's still
a couple of frowns, alright.

107
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:33,446
Some people who don't think
you've got the ticker.

108
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:37,406
Yes, I know, but this is a case I've
been handling for nearly two years.

109
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:38,966
It should wind up today.
Alright.

110
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:41,086
Well, the electorate needs
to see you at the coalface

111
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:42,766
right up till election day, alright?

112
00:06:42,926 --> 00:06:44,726
Ah, here we go.

113
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:58,326
Nothing you can do
can ever make up for this.

114
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,286
Alright, now, you make sure
you're back in time

115
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:02,566
for the under-18s netball final,
alright?

116
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:05,166
They're daughters of
Greeks and Italians.

117
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:08,846
We are knee-deep
in a racist shit storm

118
00:07:09,006 --> 00:07:11,206
courtesy of the rabid Ms Langhorn.

119
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:13,166
It is vital that
we be seen publicly

120
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:17,366
with some of your, er, less
controversial ethnic groups, OK?

121
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:21,006
Is it necessary to do it,
dancing in these hats?

122
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:23,886
We'd do it in nappies
if it'd win votes.

123
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:37,726
Yep, stick it in the boot, Ali.
In the boot.

124
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:53,486
Good, eh? Half yoghurt, cat piss.
Old village trick.

125
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:55,446
Good on ya. Thanks, Ali. Good, mate.

126
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:57,406
Anytime, anytime.
Yeah, see ya.

127
00:07:57,566 --> 00:07:59,406
Right, let's go, Reg.

128
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:01,446
Your Honour, this matter
has dragged on for 22 months

129
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:03,966
Your Honour, this matter
has dragged on for 22 months

130
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:06,046
in which time Mr Greene
has failed to produce

131
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:07,966
one shred of documentary evidence.

132
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:10,206
We again submit
that Mr Greene be required

133
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:13,486
to produce the documents under
subpoena or be held in contempt.

134
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:17,606
Yes. Mr Greene?
Cometh the hour, cometh the man.

135
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:18,646
Er, I...

136
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:20,606
Oh, shit. Er...

137
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,286
Er, I agree, Your Honour.

138
00:08:23,446 --> 00:08:26,806
Um, er, this thing has
dragged on way too long.

139
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:30,326
Um, I'm as anxious as anyone
to put it right,

140
00:08:30,486 --> 00:08:35,286
which is why I'm very happy to say
I can now lay this matter to rest.

141
00:08:35,446 --> 00:08:37,526
I have the documents with me.

142
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:39,446
As has been established, Your Honour,

143
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:43,286
er, my financial records
were severely storm damaged,

144
00:08:43,446 --> 00:08:45,726
um, but I have managed to track down,

145
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:49,686
er, almost all the relevant
surviving papers.

146
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:54,526
According to the subpoena,
Your Honour,

147
00:08:54,686 --> 00:08:59,806
I was required to produce financial
records for the years 2004...

148
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:04,206
...er, 2005.

149
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:06,486
Very difficult to make copies
of these, Your Honour.

150
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,006
God! What is that smell?

151
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:11,326
We're not entirely sure,
Your Honour. It's possibly rat urine.

152
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:13,686
They were very badly damaged.
Get them out of here!

153
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:16,366
Your Honour, we can have this matter
dealt with within a couple of hours.

154
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:18,926
Look, get them out! How dare you
bring that into my court!

155
00:09:19,086 --> 00:09:22,006
I wasn't aware that they actually
smelt as bad as that, Your Honour.

156
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,766
I have a deviated septum.

157
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:25,806
I think we may guess how you got it.

158
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,206
Mr Greene, you are in contempt.

159
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:31,166
Remove this man from my court
and place him in remand.

160
00:09:31,326 --> 00:09:33,486
How dare you mock this place?!

161
00:09:36,206 --> 00:09:38,526
Er, mate, do you mind if I...
Oh, yeah, mate.

162
00:09:38,686 --> 00:09:40,006
Thanks.

163
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,086
Er, Lily, listen, you've caught me
at a rather awkward time.

164
00:09:43,246 --> 00:09:45,326
When isn't it
an awkward time for you?

165
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:49,006
How is every little thing,
big sister?

166
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,286
Dad's had a stroke.
He's in hospital.

167
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:54,206
Is he alright?

168
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:56,206
He's doing Latin dancing
as we speak.

169
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:58,126
I really just rang
to hear your voice.

170
00:09:58,286 --> 00:09:59,806
I mean is he gonna live?

171
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:04,046
Here's a crazy suggestion —
why not drive up here and find out?

172
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:08,286
Alright, look, I-I'm gonna be a little tied
up for the next couple of days, OK,

173
00:10:08,446 --> 00:10:10,286
but I'll try and get up there
on the weekend.

174
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:13,406
Yeah, well, you do that and I'll
tell him not to die before then.

175
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:20,846
Oh, yes, yes,
keep the good times rolling.

176
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:25,646
Gentlemen.
Cleave?

177
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:27,126
Nab. How are ya?

178
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:28,766
What are you here for?

179
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:32,126
Oh, you know, mate, nip and tuck,
bit of lipo.

180
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:34,446
Bucket, how are ya?

181
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:35,926
Give us some room there, Tuvo.
How are you?

182
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:39,526
Take the weight off, eh?
How you going? Alright?

183
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:45,206
This morning at 10:15am
we arrested Eddie Langhorn.

184
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:48,246
Thought that'd get your attention.

185
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:53,326
No, Warwick, I was just intrigued
by the way you said 10:15am

186
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,166
as if the time of day mattered.

187
00:10:57,286 --> 00:10:59,486
Look, if this is about
her Joe Sandilands diatribe,

188
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:01,086
I'm not sure that it'll stick.

189
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:03,806
Well, she seriously overstepped
this time.

190
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:06,526
There was a riot, people got hurt.

191
00:11:06,686 --> 00:11:09,726
In any event, I've heard you
bitch about her so often,

192
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:12,606
I'm reasonably confident
you'll be putting your back into it.

193
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:15,166
Hmph, more than my back.

194
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:19,926
This isn't about liking or hating.
Oh, yes, itis.

195
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:27,566
Someone's here to see you, Cleave.

196
00:11:35,606 --> 00:11:39,926
I take it Harry-sorry-David
told you of my change of address.

197
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:43,406
Well, it was spectacular,
even by your standards.

198
00:11:43,566 --> 00:11:46,006
It even rivals
your nude fountain display.

199
00:11:47,566 --> 00:11:50,366
You shouldn't have come here,
sweet Missy.

200
00:11:50,526 --> 00:11:52,846
I wanted to see that you were OK.

201
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:58,806
Well, as you can see,
a Rembrandt portrait.

202
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:00,846
More like a Jackson Pollock.

203
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:05,406
You're doing coke again, aren't you?
No.

204
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:07,646
You know you can't handle it.

205
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:13,126
My old man's knocking on
the Pearlies, apparently,

206
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:16,566
but the spawn of his loins
is doing just fine, thank you.

207
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:19,886
Why are you here?
Because you matter to me.

208
00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:23,646
I thought Harry-sorry-David Potter
mattered to you.

209
00:12:23,806 --> 00:12:25,486
How is our little magician,
by the way?

210
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:27,086
Cleaver, don't start.

211
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,726
He's gonna pop the question
any day now, you know that?

212
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:31,606
People like Harry
have got life plans.

213
00:12:31,766 --> 00:12:32,646
For God's sake.

214
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:35,606
You should be at home sorting out
quotes for your wedding napkins

215
00:12:35,766 --> 00:12:37,606
instead of visiting old Cleave
in the slammer.

216
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:40,406
You're 1,000 light years
away from Earth, aren't you?

217
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:45,366
‘May we walk our separate but
unique paths and always together.”

218
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:48,446
That's what Barney and Scarlet
had on their napkins.

219
00:12:48,606 --> 00:12:51,046
Well, you shat all over
those napkins, didn't you?

220
00:12:52,966 --> 00:12:54,806
Listen, maybe it's good
that you're in here.

221
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:56,406
You can straighten yourself out.

222
00:12:56,566 --> 00:12:59,726
Ah! The corkscrew
calls me bent, does she?

223
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:01,726
You're right —
I shouldn't have come.

224
00:13:01,886 --> 00:13:05,166
You know, you're gonna die
if you keep this up.

225
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:17,886
Hello! It's just me. I came to pick
up a file. We don't have to speak.

226
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:22,246
Who the hell are you?
Scarlet, right?

227
00:13:22,406 --> 00:13:25,766
I'm Sylvia. Adam's home from school.
He's got a fever.

228
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:27,566
Didn't Barney tell you?

229
00:13:28,886 --> 00:13:31,406
How dare you parade a strange woman
in front of my children

230
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:32,886
without consulting me first?

231
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:36,446
If this is Sylvia, the kids have
met her and they like her.

232
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:38,486
You should have called me
the moment he got sick

233
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:40,726
before pulling in some mystery shag
to help bail you out.

234
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,966
There is a protocol to
this sort of thing, you know.

235
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:45,726
Well, you've waived all rights
to talk protocol.

236
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:48,086
Those are my children
and I won't have that slag near them!

237
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:51,046
Never speak about Sylvia
like that again.

238
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,806
She's wonderful.

239
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:55,486
I have to tell you that
the sex is brilliant.

240
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:58,566
Well, I'm pleased for you.

241
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:00,046
Genuinely.

242
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,286
You know, I have moved on
with my life too

243
00:14:02,446 --> 00:14:03,886
and I have never felt more content.

244
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:07,246
But next time, you call Natalie.
She's in Melbourne, remember?

245
00:14:07,406 --> 00:14:08,846
Well, just get my mother!

246
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:12,206
So she can give Adam another
4-hour lecture on the Holocaust?

247
00:14:12,366 --> 00:14:14,086
It's our people's history.

248
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:15,846
Will you just call next time?!

249
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:18,326
Whether we're together or not,
we still co-parent.

250
00:14:35,686 --> 00:14:37,126
Sister.

251
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:39,486
I've SMS'ed you the hospital
details. You'd better come.

252
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,206
He keeps asking for you.

253
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:49,446
I need your car for the weekend
to visit my dad.

254
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:52,846
I will pay and I'll get it back
Sunday night, alright?

255
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:54,446
You've only got this room
for six weeks.

256
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:55,926
That's a no to the car?

257
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:58,446
Bravo, Cleaver, your family
must be very proud.

258
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,086
He only speaks in sarcasm, you know.

259
00:15:01,246 --> 00:15:02,646
Your little stunt in court

260
00:15:02,806 --> 00:15:05,046
finally sounds the death knell
on one very shabby career.

261
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:06,926
The conduct committee
will have no choice this time.

262
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:09,246
Not in the mood, mate.
Oh, do forgive me.

263
00:15:09,406 --> 00:15:12,726
I've had a shit of a day and
my old man might be on his way out.

264
00:15:12,886 --> 00:15:16,806
Oh, please! The dying father?!
You have no moral compass, do you?

265
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,286
Nicole!

266
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:22,326
Tolga Urdan, man or woman?
Does it matter?

267
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:27,166
I'm not expressing just my views
here or the views of the NSW Bar!

268
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:30,166
You have no ethical core,
you're a borderline sociopath

269
00:15:30,326 --> 00:15:32,006
and a disgrace to the profession.

270
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,766
Hello, Cleave.

271
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:36,126
Why me?

272
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:39,046
Your station can afford
a chorus line of silks.

273
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:42,326
I know you.
Yes, you do at that.

274
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,926
Well, you must know that

275
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:47,406
I don't agree with
a single opinion you express.

276
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:49,526
I know what I said caused a fuss.

277
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:51,846
No, no, a fuss
is when you fart in a lift.

278
00:15:52,006 --> 00:15:54,606
Several people hospitalised,
a kid on life support.

279
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:58,286
A girl was gang-raped in
broad daylight and no charges laid.

280
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:01,166
I have every right to question
this government's piss-weak stance.

281
00:16:01,326 --> 00:16:05,806
There's a line between questioning
a stance and inciting a race riot, Ed.

282
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,966
It was quite a rant.

283
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:10,806
Yeah, it was, wasn't it?

284
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:15,846
So, are you going to rescue
a damsel in distress?

285
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:21,326
No. No!

286
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:23,206
Cleave, don't be like this.

287
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:25,846
Come on, just give it a try.
It'll be fun.

288
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:27,326
I can't!

289
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,846
These are my people. Don't you...

290
00:16:30,006 --> 00:16:34,406
Look, Tolga and his family.
That girl there, I'm godfather to that girl.

291
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:36,646
I'm actually running late
for something. I've gotta fly.

292
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:38,126
See you later, Ed.

293
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:40,206
Cleave.

294
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:40,406
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!
How did they know to come here?

295
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:42,926
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!
How did they know to come here?

296
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,406
I didn't know I had an office
until 38 minutes ago.

297
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:46,886
Welcome to my life.

298
00:16:47,046 --> 00:16:49,846
Yeah, yeah. Alright, alright.

299
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:52,566
Thank you. I will make just
one short statement.

300
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:55,326
When my right to express an opinion

301
00:16:55,486 --> 00:16:58,886
sees me handcuffed
and dragged from my family home,

302
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:02,406
this is not the country that
my family raised me to love.

303
00:17:02,566 --> 00:17:05,126
Our streets are not safe,
nor are our suburbs,

304
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:07,206
nor even our beloved beaches.

305
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:13,686
We must take pause and ask ourselves
what's happened to this country?

306
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:15,966
May I add something?
Of course.

307
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:19,926
Can anyone here lend me a car
for the weekend?

308
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:21,486
Nothing alcoholic,
nothing up the nose.

309
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:23,046
Yes, alright, get off my back.

310
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:25,686
You know what I mean — he slips up
once and you call me.

311
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:28,326
I don't wanna go with him!
Why am I being subjected to this?

312
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:31,126
He has got a point. The man
was unbearable when he was well.

313
00:17:31,286 --> 00:17:32,686
I always thought he was sweet.

314
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:34,566
That's because
he's good at faking it.

315
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:37,366
Well, he's his grandfather
and death should have some meaning.

316
00:17:37,526 --> 00:17:39,686
And I want you to talk to him
about Vampira.

317
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:42,486
He hasn't spoken to me
since I kicked her out of my place.

318
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:43,966
Well, he's still seeing her.

319
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:46,406
The tissue box is full,
there are no stains on the sheets,

320
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,246
he's not doing it to himself,
he's getting it.

321
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:51,126
You do realise what you just said
is a little creepy, don't you?

322
00:17:51,286 --> 00:17:53,286
I don't think you can
talk to me about creepy.

323
00:17:53,446 --> 00:17:55,006
I see you're defending the gorgon.

324
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,046
No, I'm not. I said no.
Just you wait.

325
00:17:58,206 --> 00:17:59,966
I haven't seen her in over 10 years.

326
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:02,006
And the last time you did,
she ruined our marriage.

327
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,766
No, I did that all by myself.

328
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:06,646
Just talk to him! It's the only
reason I'm lending you the car.

329
00:18:07,806 --> 00:18:10,406
You do still have a licence,
don't you?

330
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:26,366
Fuzz.

331
00:18:29,366 --> 00:18:32,926
Mate, it can't be...
can't be good for you, listening...

332
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:43,286
Oh, well, this is bloody riveting.

333
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:54,766
Dad.

334
00:18:57,086 --> 00:19:00,606
Hi.
Hi, Pop. It's Fuzz.

335
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,486
How are you in there?

336
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,326
B-better for seeing you.

337
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:28,246
OK, that's it. Come on, let's go.

338
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:51,206
Did he say anything, Fuzzy?

339
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:52,806
He said he was better for seeing us.

340
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:55,366
Oh, hello, handsome.
Hey, Aunty Jane.

341
00:19:55,526 --> 00:19:57,326
Mwah.

342
00:19:57,486 --> 00:19:58,806
Oh, it's you.

343
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:02,326
I'll drop by the hospital again
in about half an hour.

344
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:03,326
OK.

345
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:05,126
Did HE go?
Yeah, he did.

346
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:09,406
HE's here too, you know. You can
talk DIRECTLY to him if you like.

347
00:20:09,566 --> 00:20:11,046
That'd be a waste of breath,
wouldn't it?

348
00:20:11,206 --> 00:20:12,886
Can we please not start?

349
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:16,086
You haven't see much
of your grandad, have you?

350
00:20:16,246 --> 00:20:17,886
No, not for a while.

351
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:19,126
He's a great bloke.

352
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:22,646
He'd take you fishing, talk
your ear off about rugby league.

353
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,566
Yeah, great bloke if you never
had to live with him, that is.

354
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,966
Your father's twisted.
You stay living with your mum.

355
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,806
Just because he didn't lay into you

356
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:33,286
doesn't make what happened to me
any more acceptable.

357
00:20:33,446 --> 00:20:35,326
What exactly do you think
he did to you, Cleave?

358
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:37,326
Does it have to be like
Christmas Day every time?

359
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,806
No, it doesn't.

360
00:20:38,966 --> 00:20:41,046
Let's finish this cup of tea
and this fuck-awful fruitcake

361
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,606
and get out of your hair, alright.

362
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:44,086
I've done my bit.

363
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:46,726
You sat in the hospital room
for two minutes.

364
00:20:46,886 --> 00:20:48,766
We've been there
every day for weeks.

365
00:20:48,926 --> 00:20:51,966
Grandad had such high hopes
for your father.

366
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,486
“You watch our Cleaver.” So sad.

367
00:20:54,646 --> 00:20:57,806
How's your handicrafts store, Jane?
Please Bob In.

368
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:01,286
Oh, no, that's right, you went broke.
Who would have picked that, huh?

369
00:21:01,446 --> 00:21:04,086
You'll spend time defending
that cow Eddie Langhorn.

370
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:05,806
What?
Yep, we saw your photo.

371
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:08,846
But you won't give any time to
the man who devoted his life to you.

372
00:21:09,006 --> 00:21:10,406
Who says I'm defending her?

373
00:21:10,566 --> 00:21:13,526
What, are we in the middle
of a Susan Sarandon movie here?

374
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:15,286
Alright, mate, you want the facts?

375
00:21:15,446 --> 00:21:20,366
He had a giant leather strap
and he used to lay into me with it

376
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:22,646
and he'd leave welts
all up and down my body.

377
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:24,126
- Once.
- ONCE!

378
00:21:24,286 --> 00:21:27,126
And that was after
you tried to burn the school down.

379
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,766
The whole town
wanted you bloody lynched.

380
00:21:28,926 --> 00:21:30,326
He was always laying into me.

381
00:21:30,486 --> 00:21:32,246
Did you burn down your school?
No!

382
00:21:32,406 --> 00:21:36,766
One classroom. A demountable.
On principle.

383
00:21:36,926 --> 00:21:38,766
He always had to be
the centre of attention —

384
00:21:38,926 --> 00:21:40,366
find some stupid busted cause
and put himself...

385
00:21:40,526 --> 00:21:43,246
I never had a proper relationship
with the man and you know it.

386
00:21:43,406 --> 00:21:44,446
Not like you two.

387
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:46,886
“Oh, Dad, Thommo's bowling,
can we go?”

388
00:21:47,046 --> 00:21:48,366
Cricket bored him rigid

389
00:21:48,526 --> 00:21:50,366
but he'd still take you
to all the Sydney Tests.

390
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:52,606
It wasn't the only time
he belted me, you know, mate.

391
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:54,366
Problem was
he didn't belt you enough.

392
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:57,166
Oh, I'm sorry you have
such a gobsmackingly dull life

393
00:21:57,326 --> 00:22:00,446
with lan the Rotarian
and his porcelain cat memorabilia.

394
00:22:00,606 --> 00:22:03,966
But why would I bother making it up
if it wasn't true?

395
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:07,406
I don't know, Cleave. Maybe you
have to work that one out yourself.

396
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:08,966
Here, Fuzzy,
have a browse of these.

397
00:22:09,126 --> 00:22:12,606
Tell me if any of these snaps equate
with your father's TRAGIC world view.

398
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:16,246
And I spent three hours
cooking you that fruitcake.

399
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:28,086
Mum ever talk to you about
the female menopause, mate?

400
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,126
Right.

401
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:42,446
Do you wanna ignore me?
Do you wanna dump me too?

402
00:22:42,606 --> 00:22:44,366
Go ahead, get out.

403
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:48,526
I mean it! I am sick of people
passing judgment on me!

404
00:22:48,686 --> 00:22:51,126
You don't wanna talk to me,
there's the door.

405
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:54,726
Fuzz.

406
00:22:54,886 --> 00:22:56,366
Fuzz!

407
00:22:57,646 --> 00:23:00,046
Why am I copping shit for this?

408
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:02,766
What, your mum chases the woman
down the street.

409
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:05,166
She calls her Vampira to her face.

410
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:08,846
Mum's always done stuff like that.
She's allowed to, I'm used to it.

411
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:10,766
But you rock up once a week

412
00:23:10,926 --> 00:23:13,246
and pretend to be
this cool, anything-goes guy

413
00:23:13,406 --> 00:23:15,446
and in reality
you're just a bloody fascist!

414
00:23:15,606 --> 00:23:17,406
I don't remember Hitler
expressing an opinion

415
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:19,406
about sons rooting
their English teachers.

416
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,646
I can handle you being a shit dad

417
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:23,846
because I always thought
you were my mate.

418
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:26,926
We are mates, Fuzz.
We have such great times, mate.

419
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:30,566
What about Souths games
and...and skiing last year?

420
00:23:30,726 --> 00:23:33,166
You spent the whole time
shagging the ski instructress!

421
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:35,006
Oh, yeah, alright,
not a good example, but, mate...

422
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:37,806
Why don't you understand
how much I love her?!

423
00:23:38,806 --> 00:23:44,206
Fuzz, mate, can we not
hate each other, please?

424
00:23:44,366 --> 00:23:48,486
It's all gonna end in a single bed
in some Dickensian hospital

425
00:23:48,646 --> 00:23:51,126
breaking wind
and pissing into silverware.

426
00:23:51,286 --> 00:23:53,526
Dad...
I fucking love you, Fuzz.

427
00:23:53,686 --> 00:23:55,566
I would take a bullet for you, mate.

428
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,726
Dad!

429
00:23:57,886 --> 00:24:02,166
Wendy, will you calm down?
It's largely superficial.

430
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,286
Look, I...I will pay.

431
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,286
I'm good for it.

432
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,526
No, it's just...l...

433
00:24:14,446 --> 00:24:16,766
Did Pop really take you
to see the cricket?

434
00:24:16,926 --> 00:24:19,486
You always said
it was a girls' game.

435
00:24:20,726 --> 00:24:23,326
I was unsure of my sexuality.

436
00:25:04,006 --> 00:25:07,366
I rang again on July 9.

437
00:25:07,526 --> 00:25:10,726
Er, correction. 10.

438
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:13,246
And then again on the 16th.

439
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:17,806
As I say, Elspeth, this is more
of a council matter than...

440
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:21,566
On August 2, I wrote
the Prime Minister.

441
00:25:21,726 --> 00:25:24,806
Again, the Prime Minister
is federal.

442
00:25:24,966 --> 00:25:26,486
I'm standing for State Parliament.

443
00:25:26,646 --> 00:25:28,966
So, you'll do nothing, then?
No.

444
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:31,966
On the contrary,
I will be writing to council

445
00:25:32,126 --> 00:25:34,406
and putting considerable pressure
on them

446
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:38,766
to act on this, er, grave matter
of...of the...

447
00:25:38,926 --> 00:25:42,606
Weekly collection of garden waste.
Yes.

448
00:25:42,766 --> 00:25:45,966
He's all piss and wind, darling.

449
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:49,606
But I like you.

450
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:53,126
OK, I think I can
swing my block for you.

451
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:55,486
I should have known when you said
“Pick a restaurant,”

452
00:25:55,486 --> 00:25:58,086
I should have known when you said
“Pick a restaurant,”

453
00:25:58,246 --> 00:26:00,086
you'd be a little uncomfortable
with Lebbo.

454
00:26:00,246 --> 00:26:01,566
Assallam aleikum.
Wa aleikum sallam.

455
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,926
Mmm.

456
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:13,526
Just wish you'd told me it was so
casual. I feel a little overdressed.

457
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:16,886
She's not Lebanese, by the way,
she's Egyptian.

458
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:19,286
She'd be very offended
if you call her a Lebbo.

459
00:26:21,606 --> 00:26:24,446
I was thinking about
our last time together.

460
00:26:24,606 --> 00:26:29,046
Oh, that weekend in Pretty Beach.
Yeah.

461
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:30,126
Mmm.

462
00:26:30,286 --> 00:26:35,446
I distinctly remember you being
pro-native title, anti-mining

463
00:26:35,606 --> 00:26:36,926
and saying that you thought

464
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:39,126
Paul Keating was
the most admirable man alive.

465
00:26:39,286 --> 00:26:41,126
I said no such thing.
You did.

466
00:26:41,286 --> 00:26:43,726
No, you're thinking
of Etta Greenburg. Ugh.

467
00:26:43,886 --> 00:26:45,886
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

468
00:26:46,046 --> 00:26:51,766
So, Ed, this shit you talk on air,
you really believe it?

469
00:26:51,926 --> 00:26:53,366
Oh, absolutely.

470
00:26:53,526 --> 00:26:55,246
Except maybe the weather.

471
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:56,886
Thank you.

472
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:02,246
I'm glad you came.

473
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,806
I need you.

474
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:07,846
Right. I remember the last time
you said that.

475
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:09,806
Just...will you hear me out, please?

476
00:27:09,966 --> 00:27:14,686
Look, Ed, you do know, don't you,
that of those five rapes,

477
00:27:14,846 --> 00:27:18,846
only your girl Mary Drouin
is dead certain it was a Muslim gang

478
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:21,406
and only two of the four other girls

479
00:27:21,566 --> 00:27:23,966
even mentioned the word ‘Muslim'
in their statements.

480
00:27:24,126 --> 00:27:27,526
Where did you hear that?
I've got friends in low places.

481
00:27:29,286 --> 00:27:32,446
Five rapes, four months, one suburb.

482
00:27:32,606 --> 00:27:34,686
Come on, Cleave,
it's gotta be the same gang.

483
00:27:34,846 --> 00:27:37,966
No, it doesn't! It doesn't
have to be anything.

484
00:27:38,126 --> 00:27:41,566
It just suits you if it's that way,
suits you to be able to

485
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:44,366
sling the words ‘Muslim', ‘gang'
and ‘rape' together on air

486
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:46,606
because it gets your demographic
all fired up, doesn't it?

487
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:50,206
Gets the blood boiling. “Yeah, yeah,
too right! Bloody towelheads.”

488
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:52,446
Have you ever been
to an Islamic country, Cleave?

489
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:53,926
Oh, don't start this shit.

490
00:27:54,086 --> 00:27:56,606
Some of the most beautiful, erudite
people I have ever met

491
00:27:56,766 --> 00:27:58,086
are Muslim women.

492
00:27:58,246 --> 00:28:03,526
But their men, their men think
women are second-class citizens.

493
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:06,286
Not only do they think we should
neither be seen nor heard,

494
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:08,326
they think we should
be able to be traded

495
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:11,206
for two goats
and a diesel generator.

496
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:12,686
Are you really OK

497
00:28:12,846 --> 00:28:14,526
about those attitudes
being imported into this country?

498
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:16,806
Well, I'm just thinking about
that diesel generator.

499
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:20,166
Right. Clitoral circumcision.
Oh, hello.

500
00:28:20,326 --> 00:28:22,646
It's been outlawed in this country
for 15 years

501
00:28:22,806 --> 00:28:25,086
but some fathers defend it
as a cultural right,

502
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:27,806
despite the fact that
they have sworn an oath

503
00:28:27,966 --> 00:28:29,926
to obey the laws of our country.

504
00:28:30,086 --> 00:28:32,806
How can mutilating your daughter
be a cultural right?

505
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:34,606
And the people that could stop it,

506
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:36,406
the people that could
enforce the laws,

507
00:28:36,566 --> 00:28:37,926
men in power like Joe Sandilands,

508
00:28:38,086 --> 00:28:40,206
they run a million miles
in the opposite direction

509
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:42,006
because they're too
politically correct to offend

510
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,246
and they're beholden
to their party room hacks

511
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:47,006
that won't alienate
their multicultural electorates.

512
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:50,566
Ed, Jewish women aren't allowed to
sit with their menfolk in synagogues.

513
00:28:50,726 --> 00:28:53,246
They're not allowed to pray at the
Wailing Wall. What's that all about?

514
00:28:53,406 --> 00:28:54,766
..smallest percentage
of practising Jews!

515
00:28:54,926 --> 00:28:57,406
And of course my dear old beloved
Catholic Church has really been at...

516
00:28:57,566 --> 00:28:59,726
Well, the Catholics are fucked...
..forefront of feminist thinking.

517
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:08,686
The same day that
I spoke to Joe Sandilands

518
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:13,846
three other jocks made the same
call to arms and no charges laid.

519
00:29:14,006 --> 00:29:15,806
Why? Card.

520
00:29:17,526 --> 00:29:19,646
Because they're inside the tent.

521
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,406
And Joe Sandilands
is scared shitless of them.

522
00:29:27,806 --> 00:29:29,646
I can make a difference.

523
00:29:29,806 --> 00:29:32,246
I can beat these boofheads.

524
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:34,966
I just have to get inside the tent.

525
00:29:35,126 --> 00:29:38,646
Why do you have to
go camping with them at all?

526
00:29:42,126 --> 00:29:44,486
Because I always liked a good fire.

527
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,126
Eddie, I'm such a fan.
It's so great to meet you.

528
00:30:17,286 --> 00:30:20,166
Well, thanks for coming down. Did
you hear me on the radio last night?

529
00:30:20,326 --> 00:30:23,286
Look, you must know
by now she's the devil.

530
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,446
Come on, Red, democracy's built

531
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:28,806
on the inalienable right
to express moronic opinions.

532
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:31,406
Except she isn't a moron,
she's the devil.

533
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:34,326
That is what the devil looks like,
that is what the devil sounds like.

534
00:30:34,486 --> 00:30:37,126
She hasn't broken the law.
The devil never does.

535
00:30:37,286 --> 00:30:39,766
All she has to do is sow doubt.

536
00:30:39,926 --> 00:30:42,646
Doubt leads to fear,
fear leads to discord,

537
00:30:42,806 --> 00:30:45,846
discord leads to some poor kid being
hit on the head with a baseball bat.

538
00:30:46,006 --> 00:30:48,686
She got up Joe's nasal chambers.
She opened a debate.

539
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:51,766
Any passionately held opinion's
gonna cause conflict.

540
00:30:51,926 --> 00:30:55,246
Choose a god, choose a footy team,
back a politician,

541
00:30:55,406 --> 00:30:56,926
you're now a part
of the great divide.

542
00:30:57,086 --> 00:30:59,526
Should Israel build settlements in
the Occupied Territories?

543
00:30:59,686 --> 00:31:03,166
Oh, please! Let's not pretend
this is about freedom of speech.

544
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:07,726
No, she's a performing seal
for the politically powerless.

545
00:31:07,886 --> 00:31:10,126
You really don't like her, do you?

546
00:31:12,486 --> 00:31:15,566
Within two hours
of Ms Langhorn's diatribe,

547
00:31:15,726 --> 00:31:18,726
seven separate incidents broke out
in south-western Sydney.

548
00:31:18,886 --> 00:31:21,006
Eight people were injured,

549
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:23,806
one teenage boy seriously so.

550
00:31:25,326 --> 00:31:28,046
The defence will argue
that she did not intend this.

551
00:31:28,206 --> 00:31:31,166
But Ms Langhorn is
a highly intelligent woman

552
00:31:31,326 --> 00:31:34,246
with Arts/Law degrees
from Melbourne University

553
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:37,086
and a masters from
the Columbia School of Journalism.

554
00:31:37,246 --> 00:31:41,606
There is no doubt that she knew
precisely the parameters

555
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,406
of the law that she was breaking.

556
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:47,206
Edwina Langhorn
is a human starting gun.

557
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:49,646
And we will prove it.

558
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:58,886
Mr Elliott, you have been convicted
of causing grievous bodily harm.

559
00:31:59,046 --> 00:32:04,046
What prompted you to go out and
beat up a group of total strangers?

560
00:32:04,206 --> 00:32:06,646
It's a bloody war out there,
and she gets that.

561
00:32:06,806 --> 00:32:09,326
I mean, none of you lot live
where I come from.

562
00:32:09,486 --> 00:32:12,126
You don't hear them yelling at us
from cars, spitting on us,

563
00:32:12,286 --> 00:32:13,606
hitting our women.

564
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:16,566
If we don't fight back,
then we're losing who we are.

565
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,606
Oh, that would be a pity indeed.

566
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:22,486
If you hadn't have listened
to Ms Langhorn's broadcast,

567
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:26,566
would have you still gone out and
attacked these people, do you think?

568
00:32:26,726 --> 00:32:28,166
Dunno.

569
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:32,086
What does the word ‘prevailing' mean?

570
00:32:32,246 --> 00:32:33,366
Not sure.

571
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:35,806
What about ‘bridle'?

572
00:32:37,126 --> 00:32:38,446
To get married?
Er, yes.

573
00:32:38,606 --> 00:32:42,646
But as in “to bridle a horse”.
What does that mean?

574
00:32:43,686 --> 00:32:46,046
To marry one?

575
00:32:46,206 --> 00:32:47,766
OK.

576
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:49,726
Er, what about ‘causal'?

577
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:51,726
When you don't have to wear a suit.

578
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:55,366
Right, so not the sort of clothes
you'd wear to marry a horse?

579
00:32:55,526 --> 00:32:56,926
Your Honour!

580
00:32:57,086 --> 00:32:58,966
Your Honour, these were all words

581
00:32:59,126 --> 00:33:01,406
used by Eddie Langhorn
in her broadcast.

582
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:05,086
Mr Elliott doesn't seem to know
the meaning of any of them,

583
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:07,406
which does beg the question

584
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:13,926
did he understand a single word my
client was saying in her broadcast?

585
00:33:14,086 --> 00:33:16,806
Thank you, Your Honour.

586
00:33:20,846 --> 00:33:23,806
What in the blue blazes is this?

587
00:33:23,966 --> 00:33:27,446
Er, livestock of some description?

588
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30,526
No, no, it's a human organ, isn't it?

589
00:33:30,686 --> 00:33:32,526
I'm pretty sure it's an animal.

590
00:33:35,086 --> 00:33:38,366
Where was the town where your
parents renewed their wedding vows?

591
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:41,966
Pardon? Where they...?
Renewed their wedding vows.

592
00:33:42,126 --> 00:33:45,366
San Gimignano.
I thought that's what you said.

593
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:51,006
Just think, some poor bloody idiot
has wasted nine months of their life

594
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:54,686
gluing bits of blue and yellow
ceramic onto lycra,

595
00:33:54,846 --> 00:33:56,566
and no-one can tell me what it is.

596
00:33:56,726 --> 00:33:58,886
Got second prize.

597
00:33:59,046 --> 00:34:00,966
I see our camel has caught your eye.

598
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:03,526
A camel!
A camel!

599
00:34:03,686 --> 00:34:07,286
Local girl. Julia Robinga.
Lives just two streets away.

600
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:09,286
All local artists.

601
00:34:09,446 --> 00:34:11,246
Well, there you go, Dave,

602
00:34:11,406 --> 00:34:14,766
so much talent in just
the one little electorate, eh?

603
00:34:19,526 --> 00:34:19,566
Bob Menzies. Named after
our famous prime minister?

604
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:23,406
Bob Menzies. Named after
our famous prime minister?

605
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:26,966
No, after a car dealer from Moorang.

606
00:34:27,126 --> 00:34:29,926
You're 2WE's general manager.

607
00:34:30,086 --> 00:34:33,446
What sort of asset has Edwina
Langhorn been to your station?

608
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:35,126
Oh, she's a cracker.

609
00:34:35,286 --> 00:34:39,046
Smart, hard-working, tough.
No airs and graces.

610
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:42,246
I mean, not too many women
could move from print into radio

611
00:34:42,406 --> 00:34:44,646
but she goes it toe to toe
with any of the boys.

612
00:34:44,806 --> 00:34:47,126
And your revenue from
her Drivetime slot?

613
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:49,966
Increased by over 120%.

614
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:52,566
I read a report
in the ‘Financial Review'

615
00:34:52,726 --> 00:34:55,326
that Ted Gorman,
your King of Breakfast,

616
00:34:55,486 --> 00:34:58,006
has hinted that he might be leaving
at the start of next year.

617
00:34:58,166 --> 00:34:59,486
That must be of huge concern.

618
00:34:59,646 --> 00:35:02,406
Oh, well, Ted's
a once-in-a-generation talent.

619
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:05,726
And would you think of Ms Langhorn
as a possible replacement?

620
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,846
Eddie's hat will be
one of several in the ring.

621
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:11,326
Oh, so I suppose anything that
heightened her profile

622
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:12,806
or improved her demographic

623
00:35:12,966 --> 00:35:15,366
would be of enormous benefit
in securing that show?

624
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:18,286
Eddie's been banging on about
this Mary Drouin case

625
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:20,166
long before Ted
made his announcement,

626
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,886
if that's what you're insinuating.

627
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:26,126
Yes, but Ted Gorman announces
his departure on July 1.

628
00:35:26,286 --> 00:35:29,046
And on July 8,
Ms Langhorn goes ballistic

629
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:32,086
and her photograph ends up
on the front page of every paper.

630
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:34,406
And you, as the 17-year operator

631
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:37,486
of one of Australia's
most profitable radio networks

632
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:40,206
really see no correlation
between those events?

633
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:42,206
No, I don't.

634
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:44,726
Well, why didn't you tell me about
Ted Gorman leaving?

635
00:35:44,886 --> 00:35:47,206
How could you not know?
What rock have you been living under?

636
00:35:47,366 --> 00:35:50,086
The rock that doesn't listen
to your fucking radio station.

637
00:35:50,246 --> 00:35:52,606
You are the worst kind of snob.

638
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,326
I don't appreciate
you humiliating my listeners.

639
00:35:57,486 --> 00:35:58,806
Who would that be?

640
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:00,806
The boy in the stands.
You were rough on him.

641
00:36:00,966 --> 00:36:03,086
What, the boy who used a baseball bat
on somebody's head?

642
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:06,046
Look, if he hasn't had the benefit
of a decent education,

643
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:09,326
if he is genuinely concerned about
the future direction of his country,

644
00:36:09,486 --> 00:36:11,566
then I am proud
to speak on his behalf.

645
00:36:11,726 --> 00:36:13,926
You of all people
should understand that, Cleave.

646
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,606
How many AVO applications have you
successfully defended?

647
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:19,366
Oh, don't start this shit.
No!

648
00:36:19,526 --> 00:36:22,126
Women living in fear of being
assaulted, raped and murdered

649
00:36:22,286 --> 00:36:23,686
but you represent those men.

650
00:36:23,846 --> 00:36:25,486
Yeah, yeah.
Why? Why?

651
00:36:25,646 --> 00:36:27,246
Because somebody's got to.

652
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:30,086
That's what a defence lawyer does.

653
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:33,726
We're both just advocates for hire.

654
00:36:35,286 --> 00:36:37,486
We're two sides of the same coin.

655
00:36:39,326 --> 00:36:43,886
Don't you think it's about time
you....grew up and worked that out?

656
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:46,886
You're killing me.

657
00:37:57,886 --> 00:37:59,366
RED!

658
00:38:02,526 --> 00:38:04,006
RED!

659
00:38:10,086 --> 00:38:13,086
RED!

660
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:21,246
Red, what are you doing?

661
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:25,926
What are you doing?

662
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:29,606
Is Venus to the left or right
of the Southern Cross?

663
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:31,766
Red, come on.
Do you know?

664
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:34,886
Red, come on, sweetheart,
we've gotta go.

665
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,726
You see, Barney knows.

666
00:38:37,726 --> 00:38:41,726
Yeah, on a clear night,
he...he takes the kids out

667
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:44,526
and he talks to them
about the stars.

668
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:56,166
I don't know, I think
it's one of those low ones.

669
00:39:05,326 --> 00:39:06,806
Barn.

670
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:11,806
Scarlet was attacked last night.

671
00:39:11,966 --> 00:39:13,486
What? Is she alright?
Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

672
00:39:13,646 --> 00:39:16,686
It was just a bunch of thugs who
wanted to scare the shit out of her.

673
00:39:16,846 --> 00:39:19,726
Why? What did they want?
Nothing, as far as she could tell.

674
00:39:19,886 --> 00:39:23,046
Is this your client's work?
Eddie isn't like that.

675
00:39:23,206 --> 00:39:27,326
Sympathy for the devil, is it?
Go do your job.

676
00:39:31,806 --> 00:39:35,446
Here's what I think we should do.
No seconds. I have a lecture.

677
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:39,086
After the election
and before I get sworn in,

678
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:40,966
I think we should go to Italy.

679
00:39:41,126 --> 00:39:42,526
You're kidding!

680
00:39:42,686 --> 00:39:48,126
The full deal —
Milan, Rome, Florence.

681
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:51,566
And then I think we should end up
in San Gimignano.

682
00:39:51,726 --> 00:39:53,046
Where?

683
00:39:53,206 --> 00:39:55,966
Where your parents
reaffirmed their vows.

684
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:58,286
Yes! Right.

685
00:39:58,446 --> 00:40:02,886
I couldn't find that cathedral
you described online.

686
00:40:03,046 --> 00:40:04,766
I'll keep trying.

687
00:40:04,926 --> 00:40:09,206
I hope I haven't confused it with
the church I was confirmed in,

688
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,126
which is in France.

689
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,406
You know, sometimes
you confuse and distort

690
00:40:13,566 --> 00:40:14,966
memories from your childhood.

691
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:17,086
No. No, not really.

692
00:40:19,006 --> 00:40:23,046
Anyway, that's where I think
we should go because, er...

693
00:40:24,246 --> 00:40:27,046
..well, that's where I think
you and I should get married.

694
00:40:33,006 --> 00:40:37,806
Sorry, mate, the Mary Drouin thing
is out of bounds.

695
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:41,126
You should know better than that.
My hands are tied.

696
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:42,766
Yeah.

697
00:40:43,766 --> 00:40:45,086
I understand, I...

698
00:40:45,246 --> 00:40:48,646
No, I just thought that...
Leave it. Leave it, alright?

699
00:40:48,806 --> 00:40:50,246
There's nothing I can do.

700
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,166
You right?
Yep.

701
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:57,246
Oh!

702
00:40:57,406 --> 00:40:59,086
Sorry, mate.

703
00:40:59,246 --> 00:41:01,446
What's the score?
Oh, three apiece.

704
00:41:01,606 --> 00:41:03,806
Three apiece?
Yeah.

705
00:41:04,846 --> 00:41:06,806
Let's call it a draw, eh?
Hey?

706
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:09,006
Yeah, mate, neither of us
is gonna get to nine.

707
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,726
I'm gonna hit the showers.
Oh, come on!

708
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:11,966
No.

709
00:41:18,046 --> 00:41:20,286
Say hi to Scarlet
if you see her, will you?

710
00:41:20,446 --> 00:41:21,286
Yeah, sure.

711
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,006
See ya, mate.
See ya.

712
00:41:24,246 --> 00:41:26,006
Hey, you forgot...

713
00:41:37,486 --> 00:41:40,446
So in your conversation
with the Attorney-General,

714
00:41:40,606 --> 00:41:43,126
you were merely trying
to elicit answers

715
00:41:43,286 --> 00:41:45,326
about the brutal rape of Mary Drouin?

716
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:47,486
And the four other girls,
that's correct.

717
00:41:47,646 --> 00:41:52,166
Did you, through your choice
of words, intend to cause

718
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:55,766
racial unrest and/or a riot?

719
00:41:55,926 --> 00:41:57,246
Absolutely not.

720
00:41:57,406 --> 00:42:00,126
“People are forced
to arm themselves.”

721
00:42:00,286 --> 00:42:04,166
“If I was a young man
with a sister or a mother...

722
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:07,166
“..I know what I'd be doing.”

723
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:11,006
What would you be doing?

724
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:14,606
Well, I meant that I sympathise
with their anger.

725
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:16,646
Our streets are not safe.

726
00:42:16,806 --> 00:42:21,086
Surely you meant more than that.
You describe it as a war.

727
00:42:21,246 --> 00:42:24,686
Well, the ‘Sunday Sun' is currently
running a war on fat.

728
00:42:24,846 --> 00:42:26,246
I don't think
they're advocating that

729
00:42:26,406 --> 00:42:29,326
their readers run out
and machete people with cellulite.

730
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:32,206
I mean, clearly I was
speaking metaphorically.

731
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:34,846
You talked about right-minded people
arming themselves,

732
00:42:35,006 --> 00:42:37,686
taking the law into their own hands,
picking up cudgels.

733
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,206
That doesn't sound metaphorical.

734
00:42:39,366 --> 00:42:42,926
What other possible meaning could
your listeners interpret from this?

735
00:42:43,086 --> 00:42:45,686
The need for action.
Not violent action.

736
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:49,806
As Al Gore says,
I raise an inconvenient truth.

737
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:53,926
An interesting example, because you
don't buy global warming, do you?

738
00:42:54,086 --> 00:42:57,326
Well, only stupid people
don't buy into global warming

739
00:42:57,486 --> 00:43:00,686
but intelligent people
question its causes.

740
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:03,486
We could debate this all day
but I don't wanna bore the jury.

741
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:07,766
I mean, you do feel it, don't you,
the tension, the fear in this city?

742
00:43:07,926 --> 00:43:10,206
Ms Langhorn, please.
The Germans stood idly by.

743
00:43:10,366 --> 00:43:12,406
How dare you appropriate
the Holocaust for your own...

744
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:13,726
Ms Engels.

745
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:16,926
Apologies, Your Honour.

746
00:43:18,366 --> 00:43:22,326
Er...Your Honour,
I request a brief recess.

747
00:43:22,486 --> 00:43:25,566
- Mr Greene?
- Er...

748
00:43:37,846 --> 00:43:40,406
Ask Eddie about a visit she got
from Mary Drouin's sister

749
00:43:40,566 --> 00:43:42,046
a week before the riots.

750
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:43,206
Why?

751
00:43:44,526 --> 00:43:47,166
You have 15 minutes.
I've gotta give it back.

752
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:53,326
Sylvia is an agency nanny,
by the way.

753
00:43:53,486 --> 00:43:55,646
She charges 32 bucks an hour.

754
00:43:57,126 --> 00:43:58,606
Oh.

755
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,326
She seemed nice.

756
00:44:04,486 --> 00:44:06,206
She is.

757
00:44:16,926 --> 00:44:18,726
Home stretch.
Good.

758
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:21,006
Because I've booked a place
at Pretty Beach for the weekend.

759
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:23,806
How does you, me
and no Etta Greenburg sound?

760
00:44:25,726 --> 00:44:27,206
Ms Engels.

761
00:44:28,886 --> 00:44:31,886
Are you done with the defendant?
Not quite, Your Honour.

762
00:44:32,046 --> 00:44:33,686
One or two more.

763
00:44:33,846 --> 00:44:39,046
Your friend Mary Drouin, you know
her sister Tamsyn also, don't you?

764
00:44:40,366 --> 00:44:41,966
I met her once.

765
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:47,206
I understand that she came to visit
you a week before the broadcast.

766
00:44:47,366 --> 00:44:49,246
How did you get on?

767
00:44:50,246 --> 00:44:52,486
Oh, she seemed pleasant enough.

768
00:44:53,486 --> 00:44:55,486
Must have seemed
a little more than pleasant.

769
00:44:56,606 --> 00:45:00,086
I believe that you gave her $20,000,
did you not?

770
00:45:00,246 --> 00:45:02,406
As a matter of fact, I did.

771
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:03,886
I see.

772
00:45:04,046 --> 00:45:06,446
I gave her money to help Mary

773
00:45:06,606 --> 00:45:08,966
with her various psychological
and medical needs.

774
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:12,166
Why did you give the money
to Tamsyn and not Mary?

775
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:14,686
Well, Mary's in no fit state.

776
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:16,646
So it wasn't to keep her quiet then?

777
00:45:16,806 --> 00:45:19,246
Objection, Your Honour.
Apologies, Your Honour.

778
00:45:19,406 --> 00:45:25,166
Ms Langhorn, what did Tamsyn Drouin
tell you when she visited you?

779
00:45:27,606 --> 00:45:29,646
Oh, she, um...

780
00:45:29,806 --> 00:45:34,846
She came to me with...with
a wild story. I didn't believe it.

781
00:45:35,006 --> 00:45:37,806
Oh, what about her story
didn't you believe?

782
00:45:40,366 --> 00:45:44,806
Five girls were raped...
over four months in the same area.

783
00:45:44,966 --> 00:45:48,126
Your Honour, I'd ask you to direct
the defendant to answer the question.

784
00:45:48,286 --> 00:45:49,766
Ms Langhorn.

785
00:45:49,926 --> 00:45:51,326
She was suggesting that

786
00:45:51,486 --> 00:45:54,886
the rape had not happened
quite as Mary had described it.

787
00:45:55,046 --> 00:45:57,526
I felt she was clearly...
What did she say?

788
00:46:00,686 --> 00:46:03,686
That it had been a family member.

789
00:46:06,246 --> 00:46:08,366
And that the whole story
about the Muslim gang

790
00:46:08,526 --> 00:46:11,486
had been invented by the family
to cover up the truth?

791
00:46:11,646 --> 00:46:13,126
You meet Mary, you meet Tamsyn,

792
00:46:13,286 --> 00:46:15,606
you tell me who you think's
the more reliable!

793
00:46:15,766 --> 00:46:18,726
So let's just be clear here,
shall we?

794
00:46:18,886 --> 00:46:20,966
You chose to give $20,000

795
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:24,326
to the sister whom you thought
to be unreliable?

796
00:46:24,486 --> 00:46:29,686
Er, Your Honour, my client is charged
with inciting racial hatred.

797
00:46:29,846 --> 00:46:32,686
This is a case about
the words she used.

798
00:46:32,846 --> 00:46:38,046
Whether or not she paid money to
Mary Drouin, Mary Drouin's sister,

799
00:46:38,206 --> 00:46:40,086
her great-aunt or her cat,

800
00:46:40,246 --> 00:46:42,926
is irrelevant to
these particular proceedings.

801
00:46:43,086 --> 00:46:47,726
I would ask that the exchange between
Ms Engels and Ms Langhorn

802
00:46:47,886 --> 00:46:50,526
pertaining to this money
be deemed irrelevant,

803
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:54,486
and, respectfully, that you ask
the jury to disregard it.

804
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:56,486
- Your Honour.
- I quite agree, Mr Greene.

805
00:46:56,646 --> 00:47:01,566
Members of the jury, you must not
take into account any testimony

806
00:47:01,726 --> 00:47:06,446
as to any payments from
Ms Langhorn to Ms Tamsyn Drouin.

807
00:47:11,486 --> 00:47:15,166
Well, I guess on the upside,
I got you off.

808
00:47:17,486 --> 00:47:19,446
Yeah, I suppose you did.

809
00:47:20,446 --> 00:47:22,646
It was never really about that,
though, was it?

810
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:26,406
It was a publicity drive.
No.

811
00:47:26,566 --> 00:47:29,286
You made Mary Drouin
the poster girl for your cause

812
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:30,766
and then you discovered

813
00:47:30,926 --> 00:47:33,646
that she wasn't raped by a Muslim
gang but her own dad.

814
00:47:33,806 --> 00:47:37,846
So that was another
inconvenient truth.

815
00:47:38,886 --> 00:47:41,686
One that could never
see the light of day.

816
00:47:42,766 --> 00:47:45,726
Sometimes the cause is bigger
than the individual.

817
00:47:47,006 --> 00:47:50,126
Four other girls were raped.
Somebody's gotta be angry for them.

818
00:47:50,286 --> 00:47:54,446
Well, my guess is you've set
the cause back a good long way.

819
00:47:56,526 --> 00:47:58,886
I know in my heart
I did the right thing.

820
00:48:00,606 --> 00:48:04,166
And I know in my heart
I won't be coming to Pretty Beach.

821
00:48:24,326 --> 00:48:26,646
Ooh, yeah.

822
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,646
Steak?

823
00:48:33,806 --> 00:48:35,966
Don't tell me
you are actually cooking.

824
00:48:36,126 --> 00:48:38,366
The start of the new me.

825
00:48:38,526 --> 00:48:44,606
Thickly sliced, grass-fed,
prime Angus Scotch with green beans.

826
00:48:44,766 --> 00:48:46,566
Huh?
Just the steak and beans?

827
00:48:46,726 --> 00:48:48,886
All a growing boy needs.

828
00:48:49,046 --> 00:48:50,526
No rehab?

829
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:55,206
Oh, they tried to make me
go to rehab but I said no.

830
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:56,686
