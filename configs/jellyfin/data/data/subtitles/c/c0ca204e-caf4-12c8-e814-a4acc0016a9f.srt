1
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:44,965
Nah, I swear, mate.
I just shushed him. Shushed him!

2
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:48,565
As in, you know,
“Shut your cave, mate.

3
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:50,125
“The main feature's started.”

4
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:53,925
I mean, the bastard talked all the way
through the coming attractions!

5
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:56,725
Are you calling because
you want Jane and me to post bail?

6
00:00:56,885 --> 00:00:58,485
You know, Lil, your cynicism
frightens me sometimes.

7
00:00:58,645 --> 00:00:59,965
You're my sister.

8
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,325
In times of crisis, family members
should be able to turn to each other.

9
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:04,805
I mean, you know,

10
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:09,685
if you and Jane wanted to discuss bail,
I wouldn't be averse.

11
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:11,685
You are unbelievable.

12
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:14,005
You know that Dad's estate
went to that bloody con man.

13
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:16,445
Yes, which is why I'm in this mess
in the first place.

14
00:01:16,605 --> 00:01:19,485
I was trying to do the decent thing,
God help me — get your money back.

15
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:21,845
We didn't ask you
to get our money back!

16
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,045
Well, who else is gonna
get your money back?

17
00:01:24,205 --> 00:01:26,685
Can't you see that
you guys posting bail for me,

18
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:28,245
it's a win-win for everyone?

19
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:30,725
Oh!

20
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:42,965
An old mate of yours,
apparently, Greene.

21
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,045
Cleaver Greene.

22
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:54,005
Yeah.

23
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:58,605
You know...I've still got
that Justin Bieber bracelet.

24
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,245
Oh, yeah.

25
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:08,205
You were part of Cal McGregor's
Praetorian Guard.

26
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:11,405
I'm surprised you're not
deputy commissioner by now.

27
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,525
What are you in for?

28
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:16,405
They say it's perversion
of the course of justice.

29
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:19,565
You've obviously been pissing
in the wrong end of the pool.

30
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:22,885
Cleaver, I'm sorry about
all that shit we put you through.

31
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:24,525
We were just following orders.

32
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:26,685
Right.

33
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:30,925
You're a barrister, right?
You gotta be kidding me.

34
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,445
Cleaver, you've gotta help me.

35
00:02:32,605 --> 00:02:35,365
I'm a bent cop. If I stay in here
I'm a fucking dead man.

36
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:37,165
Greene.

37
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,645
Your bail's been posted.

38
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:40,125
Cleaver, please.

39
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:43,125
Oh.
Please.

40
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:45,565
Justin Bieber bracelet.

41
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:48,165
Fuck that was funny!

42
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:57,365
You sure
you can afford this?

43
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:59,605
I've got a bestseller,
Cleave. Remember?

44
00:02:59,765 --> 00:03:01,285
I'm about to have a second.

45
00:03:01,445 --> 00:03:04,845
And just so that you know,
there's going to be a movie.

46
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:06,325
I'm sorry?

47
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:08,405
They want to make a movie
about Josh and me.

48
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:10,645
Who's ‘they'?
Ron Howard's company.

49
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:15,245
Ron How...Ron Howard's company?

50
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:17,045
Potsie?
Richie.

51
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:19,405
He's producing and directing, yeah.

52
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:21,525
Richie is making a movie
based on your life?

53
00:03:21,685 --> 00:03:24,405
- I know. Strange world, huh?
- Hey, Melissa! Cleaver!

54
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:25,885
Ladies and gentlemen,

55
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:29,125
I have had charges of manslaughter
levelled against me.

56
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:31,565
They're charges of which
I'm entirely innocent.

57
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:33,765
I have no further comment
to make at this moment.

58
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:36,125
Melissa, can you confirm reports
that Scarlett Johansson

59
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:38,605
will be playing you in the upcoming
movie based on your book?

60
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:40,645
I can't confirm
anything at this point,

61
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:43,325
but it is true that Scarlett's
one of many actresses

62
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:44,965
very keen to play the part.

63
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,125
And can you confirm
Daniel Craig for Josh?

64
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:49,325
That I can confirm.

65
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:51,205
And who will be playing
Cleaver Greene?

66
00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:58,605
Uh, Judi Dench —
or Dame Judi Dench, I should say —

67
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:00,285
will be playing
the role of my barrister.

68
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:02,485
We've rethought
the role a little bit.

69
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:04,285
And how honoured
do you feel, Mr Greene,

70
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:07,725
to be played by one of the great
actresses of the modern age?

71
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:12,365
As I have said, ladies and gentlemen,
I have no further comment to make.

72
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:14,765
Thank you, thank you.

73
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:17,445
- Did you get that?
- Yeah, I got it all.

74
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,125
Judi bloody Dench? You're kidding me.

75
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:20,805
Ron is an ardent feminist

76
00:04:20,965 --> 00:04:23,205
and the thinking is
it's somehow truer to the story

77
00:04:23,365 --> 00:04:24,925
if you were played by a woman.

78
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:26,725
How can it be truer to the story?!

79
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:28,645
She's British,
she's an octogenarian

80
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:30,205
and she's a ‘she'.

81
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:32,925
How is that true? This is gonna
be a bloody train wreck.

82
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:35,525
I've always thought
Ron Howard was a hack.

83
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:38,805
Houston, we have a big
fucking problem here.

84
00:04:41,325 --> 00:04:43,645
They've put me up in a hotel.

85
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:47,405
Oh, yeah. Of course they have.

86
00:04:47,565 --> 00:04:49,645
Thank you.

87
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:52,285
You're welcome.

88
00:04:57,285 --> 00:05:02,765
Oh, yes, the day that
just keeps on giving.

89
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:06,205
Mate, how is this my shit?

90
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:10,285
I cancelled the job
and the job wasn't to kill anyone.

91
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:13,405
And the ‘anyone' certainly
wasn't the guy who's now dead.

92
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:24,685
You know that moron you subbed
the job out to came to my place?

93
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:26,165
The cops were tailing him.

94
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:27,885
That's how they put
two and two together

95
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:30,325
and came up with the usual 15.

96
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:32,525
If anyone should be in trouble,
it's that fucktard.

97
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:36,485
Don't worry about Darce, mate.
He knows the score. He'll be sweet.

98
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:41,685
Kirsty, how are you?
You look fabulous!

99
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:44,165
How great is this news
about you and Col?

100
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:46,805
Am I hearing wedding bells
anytime soon?

101
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:50,885
Ohh!
Fuck, yes, you're right.

102
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:52,805
Marriage is seriously overrated.

103
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:55,125
No! Kirsty!

104
00:05:55,285 --> 00:05:57,685
Cleaver, you listen to me
very carefully.

105
00:05:57,845 --> 00:06:00,085
Are you listening very carefully?
Yes, I'm listening carefully.

106
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:05,485
OK, you never came
to see Col about Lane Hole.

107
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:09,005
We didn't have anything to do with
that old bloke. You understand me?

108
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:11,205
OK, yes, I'll see what I can do.

109
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:12,965
Not good enough!
Arggh!

110
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:16,085
Alright, OK. I'll...I'Il...

111
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:20,565
I didn't come and see Col
about Lane Hole. Fuck!

112
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:22,325
Ohh...
Good.

113
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:31,485
Alright, great.

114
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:36,525
Ooh, Cleaver, one more thing.

115
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:39,925
You have 14 days
to repay me in full.

116
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:41,885
I think it's about time
we cleared that debt.

117
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:43,765
Don't you?
You know my situation.

118
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:47,565
Do I look like I give a shit
about your situation?14 days.

Sweetheart, of course, of course.

It means a lot to me.
Oh, I... Well...

136
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:12,885
Hi, Doc.

137
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:14,685
Do you know where I am?

138
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:18,325
Judging by the tone of voice,
a place of righteous indignation?

139
00:08:18,485 --> 00:08:19,805
Very close.

140
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:21,565
I am standing in the church hall

141
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:24,205
where you were arrested
and your son was just baptised.

142
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:26,325
Now, I know you have
a lot on your plate,

143
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:27,845
what with having
recently murdered a pensioner...

144
00:08:28,005 --> 00:08:30,805
I didn't murder him.
And the charge is manslaughter.

145
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:33,925
You know why Fuzz insisted
on getting baptised?

146
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:37,725
To cleanse himself of sin,
Cleaver, your sin.

147
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:40,405
That's all he talks about now,
“The sins of my father.”

148
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:44,125
Well, he's gonna need a bloody
big vat of holy water, isn't he?

149
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:49,605
Cleaver Greene
has spent his entire career

150
00:08:49,765 --> 00:08:51,285
making sure that society's scum

151
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:53,845
are free to roam
our streets and neighbourhoods.

152
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:55,845
To this end, he has
successfully defended

153
00:08:56,005 --> 00:09:00,485
7 terrorists, 186 rapists,
93 murderers,

154
00:09:00,645 --> 00:09:03,645
countless thieves, frauds,
perverts, drug dealers

155
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:05,365
and at least one cannibal.

156
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,285
It is a client list
the criminal barrister

157
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:08,845
has been heard to boast of.

158
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:12,845
The question now
is has justice finally caught up

159
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:14,645
with Cleaver Greene himself?

160
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:18,005
This is Polly Nesbitt
for the ‘Today Project'.

161
00:09:20,845 --> 00:09:23,845
Ooh, if it isn't the first lady
of the British theatre.

162
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:26,925
I'm gonna kill you.
It wasn't personal. I promise.

163
00:09:27,085 --> 00:09:29,325
How can a nationally broadcast attack

164
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,285
on someone's personality
not be personal?

165
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,805
You're lucky it was me.
My EP wanted to go much harder.

166
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:36,885
Aren't we sort of seeing
each other or something?

167
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:38,445
You could've just said no.

168
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:41,525
I can't. I'm in a tricky
situation at work.

169
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:45,085
How?
I had a thing with the EP's niece.

170
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:47,485
His niece?
Yeah, I was experimenting.

171
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:49,885
She was this hot
19-year-old pro surfer

172
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:51,805
and things got a little bit weird.

173
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:53,285
Oh, did they?

174
00:09:53,445 --> 00:09:55,205
Turns out she'd never
been with a woman before,

175
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:57,165
but since our ‘thing'
she's become a committed lesbian.

176
00:09:57,325 --> 00:09:59,125
The family's devastated.

177
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:03,445
Well, I guess that makes pummelling
me on national telly OK, then.

178
00:10:04,445 --> 00:10:05,845
Come on.

179
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,205
I guess it was just a lapse of memory

180
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:11,085
that you happened to forget
that plugging Lane Hole

181
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:12,645
was actually your idea
in the first...

182
00:10:12,805 --> 00:10:15,085
I was fooling around!
No, no. Don't touch me.

183
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:17,085
Come on.
Oh, get off me.

184
00:10:17,245 --> 00:10:18,565
Are you sure?

185
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:21,165
Oh, what am I gonna do with you?

186
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:23,045
I've got a few thousand ideas.

187
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,405
- Hey, Cleave!
- What the fuck?

188
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:31,725
Melissa has just agreed

189
00:10:31,885 --> 00:10:34,485
to let me do an in-depth profile
on her for the show.

190
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:37,525
What? The whole two minutes?
What happened with Col and Kirsty?

191
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:39,245
Nothing!
Who are Col and Kirsty?

192
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,205
Oh, just a couple of
gangster friends of Cleave's.

193
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:43,285
The network loves gangsters.
How can I help?

194
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:46,085
You can't. You can
leave it alone, OK?

195
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,445
Please. I beg of you.
Don't...don't go near them.

196
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:51,685
Just... They had nothing
to do with anything.

197
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:53,845
Bullshit.

198
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:56,285
Am I, um, misjudging
the vibe in the room

199
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:59,765
or should the three of us be
taking a bottle of tequila to bed?

200
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,205
Cleave's given up three-ways, Pol.

201
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:06,325
He's worried he's not going to be
the centre of attention.

202
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:08,165
- To justice!
- To justice!

203
00:11:10,765 --> 00:11:14,245
Sorry it's not French. Got a couple of
marginals up in wine country.

204
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:18,005
So, Jimmy, go on.
And don't leave out a thing.

205
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:20,245
Well, it looks like
a complete cock-up, Cal.

206
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:23,285
The real target seems to have been
the old bloke's neighbour,

207
00:11:23,445 --> 00:11:26,405
a scumbag by the name of Lane Hole.

208
00:11:26,565 --> 00:11:28,445
Um, I've heard of him.

209
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,325
ASIC's been on his case.

210
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:32,045
Ripped off Greene's
old man, apparently.

211
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:36,125
Oh, right. So a vendetta?
Ooh, sounds serious.

212
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:39,005
Pity it's just manslaughter.
What do you reckon he'll get?

213
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,525
Two years. Three at a push.

214
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:43,565
Two years?! That's fucking playtime.
Mm.

215
00:11:43,725 --> 00:11:45,565
What about going him for murder?

216
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:48,085
Wasn't at the scene,
wrong bloke got killed.

217
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:49,885
It'd be impossible to prove intent.

218
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:51,885
Manslaughter's a much safer bet.

219
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,405
Huh. Bloody shame.

220
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:55,725
Mmm.
Yeah.

221
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:00,885
He came to your flat?

222
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:04,925
You are kidding me.
What sort of moron is this guy?

223
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:09,725
Uh, a ‘sub-moron'
I think is the technical term.

224
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:12,365
Anyway, I think he's done a deal.

225
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:13,885
Who with? The cops?

226
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:15,485
No, with Col and Kirsty.

227
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:17,285
If he keeps them out of it,

228
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,445
points the finger at me,
does a little quiet time,

229
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,005
then they're gonna look after him.

230
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:25,325
Col said, “Darcy will be sweet.”
They were his exact words.

231
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:27,325
I'm fucked, mate.

232
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:30,805
Morning.
Morning.

233
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:32,525
Morning.

234
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:38,685
Mate, it's manslaughter.
It's not like murder.

235
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:42,325
They don't have to prove intent,
just that you behaved recklessly.

236
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:43,885
I am aware.

237
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:46,605
I hate to say it,
but you're in for a world of pain.

238
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,765
I didn't mean for anything to happen.
It was just meant to be a warning.

239
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:51,645
And I called it off.

240
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:54,205
And they got
the wrong fucking guy!

241
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,165
Hey, Barn.

242
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:03,245
What if it wasn't manslaughter?

243
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:04,725
Sorry?

244
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,285
What if the charge was murder?
What are you talking about?

245
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:10,405
Well, then they'd have
their work cut out.

246
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:13,005
Like you say,
they'd have to prove

247
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:15,925
that I intended
to kill the poor old fella.

248
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:18,445
Hate to be Mr Picky, but the charge
isn't murder. It's manslaughter.

249
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:20,405
It doesn't have to be.
It can be changed.

250
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:22,045
You want the charge upgraded?

251
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:23,925
You're insane!
Listen to me.

252
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:26,285
If it's manslaughter,
I'm rooted, right?

253
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:27,765
I reckon.

254
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:31,125
But it it's murder, then I would
actually be in with a shot.

255
00:13:31,285 --> 00:13:32,645
Why stop at murder, Cleave?

256
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:35,325
I reckon you'd stand an even
better chance with genocide.

257
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:36,805
Captain Buzzkill.

258
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:39,645
How do you propose
to get the charge upgraded?

259
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:45,245
Ladies and gentlemen,
ever since it was publicly revealed

260
00:13:45,405 --> 00:13:48,445
that I had an affair with
the former premier of this state,

261
00:13:48,605 --> 00:13:52,765
her ex-husband, the Police Minister
and Attorney-General Cal McGregor,

262
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:56,045
has pursued a relentless vendetta
against me.

263
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:58,365
You better believe it, buddy.

264
00:13:58,525 --> 00:13:59,845
He has used his enormous power

265
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,965
as both Police Minister
and Attorney-General to harass me.

266
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,205
He's had me arrested
on numerous occasions —

267
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:06,845
all without charge, I might add...

268
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:09,645
..In an attempt
to humiliate and intimidate me.

269
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:14,725
Ooh, the humiliation isn't
over yet, pal. I promise you that.

270
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:19,445
It's a pathetic attempt by a cuckold
to try and reinvent himself

271
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:23,365
and restore his manhood
in the eyes of the community.

272
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:26,085
You're obviously throwing
some mud of your own here.

273
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:28,085
You're alleging that Cal McGregor

274
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:30,845
was responsible for bringing down
the former premier,

275
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:32,965
Claudia Marshall, his own wife.

276
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,765
Look, Tony, I don't think
it's any mystery.

277
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:37,765
From the Premier down,
everybody knows that Cal

278
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:41,565
threw his own wife under the bus,
metaphorically speaking,

279
00:14:41,725 --> 00:14:44,205
so that he could keep his own job.

280
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:47,725
And I challenge you, actually,
to ask the Premier

281
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:52,045
who leaked the text messages
that brought down Claudia Marshall.

282
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,485
This is why the Premier's
in Cal's pocket.

283
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,365
Have you got
any evidence at all..

284
00:14:57,685 --> 00:14:59,005
..to back up what you're saying?

285
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,605
Look, it's not really
my place to produce evid...

286
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:05,645
Hello.

287
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,165
Uh, yes, yes, Premier.

288
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:11,845
Yep, well, I know. I... Listen.

289
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:13,685
I know, but...

290
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:15,525
God, would you listen
to me, Stevie?!

291
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:18,165
Greene's all bark.
The story's got no legs.

292
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:22,205
You wait, mate. Who could possibly
wanna run with that bullshit?

293
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:25,845
I'm not making any comment
on Mr Greene's guilt or innocence.

294
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,205
All I'm saying is he's raising
some very important questions

295
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:31,245
about the integrity
of the justice system

296
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:33,325
that is currently under
Cal McGregor's watch.

297
00:15:33,485 --> 00:15:34,885
I mean, let's face it.

298
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:37,325
As both Police Minister
and Attorney-General —

299
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:40,685
the first person ever
to hold both posts, I might add —

300
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:42,725
he wields enormous power.

301
00:15:42,885 --> 00:15:44,645
And the question
that needs to be asked is,

302
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:46,565
“Is he abusing that power?”

303
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:50,005
And I think that question ought to be
asked by a royal commissioner.

304
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:53,325
I want Greene in a maximum security
facility by morning tea

305
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,925
and I never want him
to see the light of day again.

306
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:57,085
Do you understand?

307
00:15:57,245 --> 00:15:59,445
I told you if we run
a murder charge against Greene

308
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:00,965
there's a 98% chance he'll go free!

309
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,685
There's gotta be a way, mate,

310
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:04,965
unless you're not happy
in your role as director.

311
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,205
Fair go!
God, you've gotta have something.

312
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:11,085
You won the university medal,
for Christ's sake.

313
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:15,925
Look, there is one possibility.

314
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:18,325
But, gee whiz, there's some
serious evidentiary issues.

315
00:16:18,485 --> 00:16:21,245
Mate, you get me the charge,

316
00:16:21,405 --> 00:16:24,045
I'll get you the evidence.

317
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:40,525
Cleaver Greene.

318
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:43,445
The charge against you
of the manslaughter of Albert Platt

319
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:44,925
has been withdrawn...

320
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:46,405
Oh, you don't say, Len?

321
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:51,765
..and replaced with a charge of
conspiracy to murder one Lane Hole.

322
00:16:53,285 --> 00:16:57,725
Sorry. Did you say
conspiracy to murder Lane Hole?

323
00:16:57,885 --> 00:16:59,325
Yes, Cleave.

324
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,245
Because I...I was expecting

325
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:08,285
that it might be a charge
of murder of Albert Platt.

326
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,485
Are you sure it's...
Positive, Cleave.

327
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:15,125
“Conspiracy to murder Lane Hole.”
It says so right here.

328
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:18,005
So...

329
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,765
So now they might
be able to prove intent.

330
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:29,045
I didn't game this out
particularly well, did 1?

331
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:33,845
So how much could you be looking at
for the conspiracy charge?

332
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:35,925
Maximum's life.

333
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:38,285
So you could end up with life
instead of, what?

334
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:39,925
A couple of years for manslaughter?

335
00:17:40,085 --> 00:17:41,965
Oh, Cleave, what were you thinking?!

336
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,765
Well, I was hoping
that they would charge me

337
00:17:45,925 --> 00:17:47,965
with the murder of the sweet old guy

338
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:52,045
rather than conspiracy
to murder Lane Hole.

339
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,485
Is that it?

340
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:57,045
What?
I've got fellowship.

341
00:17:57,205 --> 00:17:58,925
Right.

342
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:03,165
You do realise the gravity
of what I've just told you?

343
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:05,445
I think so.

344
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:07,965
You might go to jail
for the rest of your life

345
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:11,325
because you didn't get the sort
of murder charge you were after.

346
00:18:11,485 --> 00:18:14,405
Oh, yeah.

347
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:19,845
I don't want you to go to jail, Dad.
I really don't.

348
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:23,245
But there's not much I can
practically do right now

349
00:18:23,405 --> 00:18:26,845
and I've got fellowship.

350
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:31,605
Fuzz, you do realise we might not have
a whole lot more time together?

351
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:33,085
So what?

352
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,365
You want me to drop
something I care about

353
00:18:35,525 --> 00:18:37,445
because you screwed up
massively again?

354
00:18:37,605 --> 00:18:38,925
Fuzz!

355
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:43,285
If I spend the rest of my life
dealing with your screw-ups

356
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:45,885
I won't have a life left
to live of my own.

357
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:47,965
Jesus.

358
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:52,045
See you, Mum.

359
00:18:52,205 --> 00:18:55,445
OK, have fun happy clapping.

360
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:58,885
J And God said to Noah

361
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:01,445

365
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:12,485

00:19:12,645 --> 00:19:15,125
Fuzz, Fuzz!

367
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:16,965
Fuzz.
Shit!

368
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:27,925
Why is it you have to mock
anything you don't understand?

369
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:33,725
Anyone and anything who's different,

370
00:19:33,885 --> 00:19:37,565
who even slightly challenges
your fucked-up world view...

371
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:41,845
..you have to reduce it
to a funny line.

372
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:47,165
This is why you're gonna
end up sad and lonely.

373
00:20:04,405 --> 00:20:06,125
He loves you, Cleaver.

374
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:08,045
He just...

375
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:11,005
He wants to be able to count on you.

376
00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:14,445
All of us do.

377
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:19,365
It...it's like you assume

378
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:22,965
we could only ever want you around
for a bit of colour.

379
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:28,965
But you need to understand that
the people who love you need you.

380
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:35,405
So stop being such a dickhead,
wise up and beat this charge.

381
00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:50,325
Cleaver. Cleaver!

382
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:57,885
It was just a moment.
A rush of blood. I was pissed.

383
00:20:58,045 --> 00:21:01,445
I didn't mean for anybody
to be killed.

384
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,125
“The awful daring
of a moment's surrender,

385
00:21:07,285 --> 00:21:10,965
“that an age of prudence
can never retract.”

386
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,125
Pius the Incontinent?

387
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:14,685
T.S. Eliot.

388
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:16,245
Bloody Anglican, mate.

389
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:18,885
High Anglican. We count them.

390
00:21:21,445 --> 00:21:24,805
Well, whatever I intended
to happen or not,

391
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:27,965
a nice old bloke is dead
as a result.

392
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:30,365
Our actions always
have consequences.

393
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:31,845
You know that, Cleaver.

394
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:35,965
If we mortals have no way
of knowing these consequences,

395
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,725
if they can be so random that
they're beyond contemplation...

396
00:21:38,885 --> 00:21:40,965
God gives us free will
sO we can make our own choices.

397
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:44,125
Bullshit.
There's no choice out there.

398
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:48,085
Just fucking chaos.

399
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:55,365
My beautiful boy took a swing
at me today.

400
00:21:57,245 --> 00:21:59,525
And I deserved it.

401
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:04,565
So he's a fighter like his dad.

402
00:22:07,365 --> 00:22:09,645
How's his mum coping?

403
00:22:09,805 --> 00:22:13,325
A little too well, actually,
from my point of view.

404
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:21,165
Oh. Oh.

405
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:22,845
Oh.

406
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:32,445
Oh.

407
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:34,205
Oh, I'm sorry.

408
00:22:34,365 --> 00:22:35,965
No, no, no, it's me.

409
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,965
No, it's not you, Roger.
Yeah, itis.

410
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,485
It's not. It's...you know.

411
00:22:39,645 --> 00:22:41,725
I have an ex-husband
facing a murder charge.

412
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:45,645
I have an evangelical son
who until recently —

413
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:47,525
well, God,
I hope until recently —

414
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:49,205
had a fetish for older women.

415
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:53,205
I'm just in a very weird place
at the moment.

416
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,685
I'm really sorry.

417
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:00,805
What?

418
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:06,245
It's not you, Wendy.

419
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:18,845
So it's true. There is illegal
gambling in Sydney after all.

420
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,845
Right. You and I
can talk freely, Col.

421
00:23:24,005 --> 00:23:26,085
We're mates.

422
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:28,485
I told you, Bump,
I'm not saying a word, mate.

423
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:31,645
I'd love to be able to tell
the court you were cooperative.

424
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,605
This is, after all, your...

425
00:23:36,285 --> 00:23:37,805
..11th offence.

426
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:43,965
Judges these days, mate,
they frown upon recidivists.

427
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:49,005
Changing the subject completely,

428
00:23:49,165 --> 00:23:50,965
have you heard the news
about Cleaver Greene?

429
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,205
Nasty business.

430
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:57,165
And we are hoping that anyone
with any information

431
00:23:57,325 --> 00:24:01,565
that can assist us with our inquiry
will come forward.

432
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:10,045
Yeah, it was a nasty business,
wasn't it?

433
00:24:10,205 --> 00:24:13,245
Cleaver said he'd come
to the end of his rope.

434
00:24:13,405 --> 00:24:15,525
You know, he'd tried everything
that he could think of

435
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:17,765
to get to Lane Hole,
but nothing had worked.

436
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:22,685
Then he said, “He's gotta die, Col.
The prick's gotta die.”

437
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:26,805
And I said, “No, Cleave,
that's crazy talk, mate.

438
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,005
“You know, violence
never solved anything.”

439
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:31,805
Then he asked me
if I knew anyone

440
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:33,765
who could do the job for him.

441
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:35,885
“A paid assassin?”', I said.

442
00:24:36,045 --> 00:24:40,125
“Nah, nah, Cleave, mate,
you've got to come to your senses.”

443
00:24:40,285 --> 00:24:42,925
So after a few months,
I broke it off with Cleaver

444
00:24:43,085 --> 00:24:46,245
because I'd fallen in love
with somebody else.

445
00:24:47,245 --> 00:24:49,285
Somebody kinder, gentler.

446
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:53,605
Somebody who understands
the true meaning of love

447
00:24:53,765 --> 00:24:57,925
and has a, um...a deep respect
for law and order.

448
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:00,765
Cleaver didn't take this
very well

449
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:03,645
and not long after that,
his father passed away.

450
00:25:03,805 --> 00:25:07,045
It turns out
that this Lane Hole fellow

451
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,965
conned Cleaver's father
out of his share portfolio.

452
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:14,445
So, you know,
Cleaver became quite obsessed

453
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:19,405
and I recall him expressing
on no less than, um...

454
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:21,005
..one...two...three occasions

455
00:25:21,165 --> 00:25:23,125
his desire to see
Lane Hole murdered

456
00:25:23,285 --> 00:25:28,365
in ways that I couldn't...
possibly describe.

457
00:25:30,965 --> 00:25:32,805
Quite frankly, I was terrified.

458
00:25:39,765 --> 00:25:41,285
Kirsty.

459
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:44,805
Kirsty! What the fuck?!

460
00:25:44,965 --> 00:25:48,045
Don't you know it's a crime to
threaten or badger the witness?

461
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:50,045
Don't you know it's a crime
to commit perjury?

462
00:25:50,205 --> 00:25:52,125
Prove it.
OK.

463
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:53,605
You know what?

464
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:55,645
I'm not going to threaten you

465
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:58,125
or badger you or...
what was the other thing?

466
00:25:58,285 --> 00:26:01,125
Oh, that's right, pay you.
Oh! You'll pay me, Cleaver.

467
00:26:01,285 --> 00:26:03,685
One way or another,
I'm going to get my money.

468
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:05,725
Oh, do you honestly think
I give a flying fuck

469
00:26:05,885 --> 00:26:07,525
what you do to me now?

470
00:26:07,685 --> 00:26:10,845
Yeah, but you do give a flying fuck
about your friend Melissa.

471
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:12,965
You two, you're very close.

472
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,245
From what I understand,
she put up your bail.

473
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:17,005
And from what I read
in the paper...

474
00:26:17,165 --> 00:26:18,565
Kirsty...
..she can afford it.

475
00:26:18,725 --> 00:26:21,405
Melissa has nothing
to do with this, alright?

476
00:26:21,565 --> 00:26:24,685
We'll see about that. She might
want to make a contribution.

477
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:26,805
She's staying at the Sheraton,
isn't she, sweet?

478
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:28,725
Why do you know that?

479
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:30,965
See you, Cleaver.

480
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,285
Oop!

481
00:26:33,445 --> 00:26:36,365
Lyle! How you doing?

482
00:26:36,525 --> 00:26:38,125
I was just thinking about you.

483
00:26:38,285 --> 00:26:40,805
Listen, I've got a favour
I want to ask of you.

484
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:42,445
Oh, fuck!

485
00:26:44,365 --> 00:26:46,005
Missy, it's me.

486
00:26:46,165 --> 00:26:47,525
Just...

487
00:26:47,685 --> 00:26:51,085
Sweetheart, um, call me
when you get this, OK?

488
00:26:51,245 --> 00:26:54,165
And just...
I'm coming to see you.

489
00:26:54,325 --> 00:26:56,365
Don't leave your room
whatever you do, OK?

490
00:26:56,525 --> 00:26:59,405
I'll be there in a minute.
Can you call me when you get this?

491
00:27:09,805 --> 00:27:10,805
Missy!

492
00:27:14,485 --> 00:27:17,965
Oh. Judi Dench
is the Protector.

493
00:27:19,765 --> 00:27:21,365
That's a microphone.

494
00:27:22,925 --> 00:27:25,205
Why don't we just pay her
the fucking money then?

495
00:27:25,365 --> 00:27:27,165
I didn't come here to ask you
to pay Kirsty for me.

496
00:27:27,325 --> 00:27:29,285
I came here to tell you
to get on a plane.

497
00:27:29,445 --> 00:27:31,285
If she'll have you hurt,
what choice do I have?

498
00:27:31,445 --> 00:27:33,045
She'll have both of us hurt.

499
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:34,725
All the more reason
to pay her then.

500
00:27:34,885 --> 00:27:36,845
Listen, can you not just
get on a plane, please?

501
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:39,685
You're going to go anyway.
Leave you here to be killed?

502
00:27:39,845 --> 00:27:42,045
Look, I think I would die
a worse death

503
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:43,685
if you actually paid Kirsty,
alright?

504
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:44,685
Cleaver...

505
00:27:44,845 --> 00:27:46,685
That debt is a monument

506
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:49,925
to my bad judgement
and self-indulgence

507
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,925
and I need to sort it out,
and I will sort it out.

508
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:58,165
And so if I have to do some time
for the poor old guy's death,

509
00:27:58,325 --> 00:28:02,525
or...or lose an eye to Kirsty,
then so be it, OK?

510
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:07,565
I would rather look at my son
half-blind than as a coward,

511
00:28:07,725 --> 00:28:09,765
and I will not be able
to live with myself

512
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:11,405
if anything happens to you.

513
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,245
How do you think I would feel

514
00:28:13,405 --> 00:28:16,205
if I could have saved your life
for two hundred grand?

515
00:28:16,365 --> 00:28:18,085
It's not just
about you, Cleave.

516
00:28:18,245 --> 00:28:22,725
Yes, itis. I'm a narcissist.
Get on a plane.

517
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:30,749
http://hiqve.com/

518
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:52,285
What the hell?

519
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:54,205
I'm sorry.
I know this doesn't look...

520
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,005
Are you crazy?
I had to see you.

521
00:28:56,165 --> 00:28:57,005
Now?

522
00:28:57,165 --> 00:28:59,005
Well, you haven't been
answering my texts.

523
00:28:59,165 --> 00:29:01,045
Nicole, listen...
I've left Bevan.

524
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:03,765
What?!
Yeah, this morning.

525
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,445
OK, OK. Uh, look.

526
00:29:07,605 --> 00:29:09,405
You might need to see
someone about this

527
00:29:09,565 --> 00:29:10,885
because what you're
going through...

528
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:12,285
Barney, I'm pregnant.

529
00:29:13,445 --> 00:29:14,605
Whoa.

530
00:29:14,765 --> 00:29:17,805
You know, that doesn't necessarily
mean I'm the father,

531
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:19,445
does it?

532
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:26,925
And the thing is,
Bevan and I made this deal

533
00:29:27,085 --> 00:29:29,805
that we wouldn't have relations
for three months

534
00:29:29,965 --> 00:29:31,445
before the wedding, you know,

535
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:35,325
to make the night
special, so...

536
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:40,445
Oh, God. Oh, God.

537
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:44,525
I can't talk about this now.

538
00:29:45,525 --> 00:29:48,445
Oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just...

539
00:29:48,605 --> 00:29:50,645
I had to tell you.

540
00:29:52,285 --> 00:29:53,365
Y-yeah.

541
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,925
l...I guess you did.

542
00:29:57,445 --> 00:30:00,245
Have you, um...have you got
somewhere to stay?

543
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:03,005
Do you need money for a hotel?

544
00:30:03,165 --> 00:30:04,885
‘Cause I've got some cash if...

545
00:30:05,045 --> 00:30:06,845
You don't have to worry
about money.

546
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:12,325
Uh... Yep.

547
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,605
You alright?

548
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:27,565
Barney?

549
00:30:34,085 --> 00:30:36,525
Oh. Jesus.

550
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:41,325
I don't feel very well.

551
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,085
I need you to do me a favour.

552
00:30:47,525 --> 00:30:49,685
OK, yep.

553
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,325
Morning, Nicole.

554
00:30:56,885 --> 00:30:58,645
Um...yes.

555
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:07,325
Red?

556
00:31:07,485 --> 00:31:10,805
Barney's as sick as a dog.
He thought you could use a hand.

557
00:31:12,485 --> 00:31:14,845
You're many things, Cleaver,
but you're not a killer.

558
00:31:17,445 --> 00:31:20,405
I call Callum
Dalgleish McGregor.

559
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:21,445
Your Honour,

560
00:31:21,605 --> 00:31:23,525
my friend, the accused,

561
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:26,245
is yet again attempting
to mock this court

562
00:31:26,405 --> 00:31:27,765
by turning these proceedings

563
00:31:27,925 --> 00:31:30,085
into another of
his lamentable circuses.

564
00:31:30,245 --> 00:31:32,725
Every witness
my friend attempts to call

565
00:31:32,885 --> 00:31:34,365
is a citizen of high office

566
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:37,325
whom he seeks to traduce
for his own base motives.

567
00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:40,085
Mr Greene,
the fact that you may share

568
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:42,605
a certain history
with Mr McGregor

569
00:31:42,765 --> 00:31:47,205
has no inherent probative
value whatsoever.

570
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:48,965
Your Honour, this is a witch-hunt

571
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:51,205
being conducted at the behest
of the Attorney-General.

572
00:31:51,365 --> 00:31:53,805
Mr Greene,
for the very, very last time,

573
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:56,925
I do not grant leave
to subpoena Mr McGregor.

574
00:31:57,085 --> 00:32:00,005
We will break there.
We will resume at two o'clock.

575
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:01,645
All rise.

576
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,485
Why don't you call me?

577
00:32:12,645 --> 00:32:13,685
What?

578
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:15,685
Call me.
I used to work for Cal.

579
00:32:15,845 --> 00:32:17,645
I know where a couple of bodies
are buried.

580
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:20,525
The judge isn't going
to let you get in the box.

581
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:25,405
What?

582
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:28,485
Maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

583
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:33,445
Your Honour,
I call Scarlet Rachel Engels.

584
00:32:33,605 --> 00:32:35,005
Your Honour...

585
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:38,925
Ms Engels is not only known
as a friend of the accused,

586
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:41,925
she is also
a disgruntled former employee

587
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,525
of the Attorney-General
with an axe to grind.

588
00:32:44,685 --> 00:32:47,845
It's just another act
in the same circus.

589
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:49,605
Indeed it is.

590
00:32:49,765 --> 00:32:52,565
I have had dozens
of conversations

591
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:54,005
with Cal McGregor

592
00:32:54,165 --> 00:32:56,125
in which he spoke
with unnerving zeal

593
00:32:56,285 --> 00:32:59,525
of his desire to be the author
of Mr Greene's demise.

594
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:02,125
He bragged of his ‘Cleaver Unit',

595
00:33:02,285 --> 00:33:04,765
officers whose sole purpose
was to intimidate...

596
00:33:05,925 --> 00:33:07,805
..and harass Mr Greene.

597
00:33:07,965 --> 00:33:10,125
Let me make this clear.
I do have an axe to grind.

598
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:13,565
Because Cal McGregor
is abusing his power,

599
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,205
and in the interests
of democracy

600
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:17,885
and the people of the state,
he must be stopped.

601
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:22,405
Now I am prepared to face any
scrutiny from him or anyone else

602
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:24,965
but, as a lawyer, I would rather
answer those questions

603
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:26,725
in a court of law
and under oath

604
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:29,845
where the penalty for perjury
iS severe.

605
00:33:31,045 --> 00:33:32,365
How about you, Cal?

606
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:34,565
Thank you.

607
00:33:34,725 --> 00:33:37,285
Ah, we just have to
sit tight, boys.

608
00:33:37,445 --> 00:33:39,045
Once the guilty verdicts in,

609
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:41,005
her words will be
lining budgie cages.

610
00:33:48,965 --> 00:33:51,325
I like to be watched
while I'm doing it.

611
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:56,245
I don't...l don't fool around
with her.

612
00:33:56,405 --> 00:33:57,725
I mean,
that would be just sick,

613
00:33:57,885 --> 00:34:02,165
but just...having her in the room,
it just helps, you know?

614
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:04,445
Just in terms of
my performance.

615
00:34:05,645 --> 00:34:07,965
Does she have a name?
Yeah.

616
00:34:11,045 --> 00:34:13,605
Ruth.
Ruth.

617
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:16,165
Yeah, Ruth.

618
00:34:16,325 --> 00:34:19,525
[...I don't have to talk to her
or anything.

619
00:34:21,485 --> 00:34:23,685
Just helps if she's in the room.

620
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:25,325
Watching?

621
00:34:28,725 --> 00:34:30,085
Does that idea bother you?

622
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:36,445
Wendy, I like you.

623
00:34:36,605 --> 00:34:39,525
I like you so much, and I'd
hate this to be a deal breaker.

624
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:45,925
Every other aspect of my life,
I am completely normal,

625
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:48,205
almost to the point of boring.

626
00:34:52,685 --> 00:34:54,925
So...

627
00:34:56,765 --> 00:34:58,605
..c-could we just give it a try?

628
00:35:04,205 --> 00:35:06,565
Yeah.

629
00:35:06,725 --> 00:35:08,485
Yeah?

630
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:24,565
Who is it?

631
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:27,205
Kirsty, this is Melissa.

632
00:35:27,365 --> 00:35:28,885
Cleaver's friend.

633
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:31,205
Oh!

634
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:00,525
Got the money?

635
00:36:10,405 --> 00:36:12,365
You know, you've saved yourself
a lot of grief.

636
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:13,845
What about Cleaver?

637
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,925
Oh, it's neither here nor there.
His life's over.

638
00:36:16,085 --> 00:36:18,325
He gets to cross-examine you today.

639
00:36:18,485 --> 00:36:21,765
Oh, big fuckin' whoopee.

640
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:24,805
He can't break me
and he knows it.

641
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:28,645
He also knows what really happened.
So?

642
00:36:28,805 --> 00:36:31,765
It's the story you spin
in this town that counts.

643
00:36:31,925 --> 00:36:34,165
And I'm gonna keep spinning
my story

644
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:37,205
until Cleaver Greene is in jail
for the rest of his life.

645
00:36:37,365 --> 00:36:38,885
Why?

646
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:43,725
The combination's 4-3-7.

647
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:45,445
Is it all in there?

648
00:36:53,165 --> 00:36:55,285
There's no money.
There's no fuckin' money!

649
00:36:55,445 --> 00:36:58,005
What the fuck is this?

650
00:36:58,165 --> 00:37:00,485
Col.

651
00:37:00,645 --> 00:37:02,965
You're gonna fuckin' die, bitch!

652
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,645
And I'm gonna fuckin' bury you

653
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,645
where no-one will
ever look for you!

654
00:37:06,805 --> 00:37:08,245
Do you understand me?

655
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:09,805
Fuck!

656
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:12,085
Oh, hello.

657
00:37:13,325 --> 00:37:15,765
Is this some kind of joke,
Cleaver?

658
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:17,805
Ah, Kirsty.
How are you?

659
00:37:17,965 --> 00:37:22,005
Yeah, well, there are gonna be
some serious fuckin' consequences.

660
00:37:22,165 --> 00:37:24,725
Kirsty, if you look up
to your right,

661
00:37:24,885 --> 00:37:27,925
you'll notice what looks like
an abandoned truck.

662
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:30,885
Now, inside that truck,
there's a film crew.

663
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:32,365
It's amazing what you can pick up

664
00:37:32,525 --> 00:37:34,485
on a long lens these days,
you know?

665
00:37:34,645 --> 00:37:36,965
I'm also reliably informed that

666
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:39,725
there's quite a few of those
teensy-weensy little

667
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:43,565
cameras and microphones
inside Melissa's car.

668
00:37:43,725 --> 00:37:46,805
And if you squint
your beady little eyes,

669
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:50,045
you'll notice me marching forward

670
00:37:50,205 --> 00:37:54,245
with, uh, Polly Nesbitt from
the ‘Today Project.

671
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:10,845
I've been under a course of
strong medication

672
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:13,245
for rheumatoid arthritis.

673
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:16,525
Um, and I've been
suffering from...

674
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:19,485
..persistent and acute sciatica.

675
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:24,925
I'm told the medication may have
caused auditory hallucinations...

676
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:29,245
..along with a sense of anxiety
and paranoia.

677
00:38:29,405 --> 00:38:32,445
I've also recently been
diagnosed with depression.

678
00:38:32,605 --> 00:38:34,565
As a consequence,
my perception of events

679
00:38:34,725 --> 00:38:36,565
may be less than reliable...

680
00:38:36,725 --> 00:38:38,645
..and, uh, my conduct erratic,

681
00:38:38,805 --> 00:38:42,125
given my, um,
unpredictable mood swings.

682
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:44,845
I wish to apologise
without reservation to the court...

683
00:38:45,005 --> 00:38:48,245
..for any misleading testimony
I may have given

684
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:50,845
regarding Mr Greene's conduct.

685
00:38:51,005 --> 00:38:53,845
I find the witness
in contempt.

686
00:38:54,005 --> 00:38:57,685
Take him down.

687
00:38:57,845 --> 00:38:59,165
Questions must be asked as to why

688
00:38:59,325 --> 00:39:01,725
these two witnesses were prepared
to perjure themselves.

689
00:39:01,885 --> 00:39:04,325
Was it simply for personal reasons,

690
00:39:04,485 --> 00:39:06,965
or were they in fact suborned
to give false evidence?

691
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,525
Is this in fact
yet another conspiracy

692
00:39:09,685 --> 00:39:11,565
orchestrated by
Cal McGregor?

693
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:15,565
In the interests of what's
left of justice in this state,

694
00:39:15,725 --> 00:39:19,285
the Attorney-General must face
this court and explain himself.

695
00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:22,445
Mr McGregor, will you be resigning
after this behaviour?

696
00:39:22,605 --> 00:39:25,525
This is disgraceful. The public
needs answers, Mr McGregor.

697
00:39:25,685 --> 00:39:28,045
I made you premier, Stevie.

698
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:30,205
Just like you made Claudia premier,
Cal.

699
00:39:30,365 --> 00:39:33,165
Don't try to play the loyalty card
with me.

700
00:39:33,325 --> 00:39:36,005
Here's what's going to happen next,
in plain English.

701
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,885
You're going to ring
your fuckwit uni mate at the DPP

702
00:39:39,045 --> 00:39:41,285
and you're going to tell him
to call you as a witness.

703
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,965
And you are gonna answer every
question Cleaver Greene puts to you

704
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,725
with a fucking smile.

705
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:49,965
And you are gonna put this thing
to bed, or you're finished, Cal.

706
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,005
Do you understand?

707
00:39:52,165 --> 00:39:55,245
Let me be crystal clear about this.

708
00:39:55,405 --> 00:40:00,165
I have never met
Kirsty Corella or Colin Mancusi.

709
00:40:00,325 --> 00:40:02,405
Never?
Never.

710
00:40:02,565 --> 00:40:05,405
And the idea that I would suborn
anyone to give false evidence

711
00:40:05,565 --> 00:40:08,845
is offensive and absurd.

712
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:12,205
Mm. But you could have
directed others to approach them.

713
00:40:12,365 --> 00:40:14,565
I could have, but I didn't.
Indeed.

714
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:16,205
Thank you, Mr McGregor.

715
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:22,965
Mr McGregor, are you aware
that the charge against me

716
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:25,125
was originally manslaughter?

717
00:40:25,285 --> 00:40:26,245
I am.

718
00:40:26,405 --> 00:40:29,685
Can you tell the court how
the charge came to be upgraded

719
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:32,845
to one of conspiracy
to commit murder?

720
00:40:33,005 --> 00:40:35,725
No idea. You'd have to
ask your learned friend.

721
00:40:35,885 --> 00:40:39,005
Is it not the case
that you used your influence

722
00:40:39,165 --> 00:40:43,685
to have the charge upgraded as
a result of media interviews I gave

723
00:40:43,845 --> 00:40:45,885
which you found
a little bit embarrassing?

724
00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:48,245
That is not the case, Mr Greene.

725
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:51,005
Because, of course,
my learned friend here

726
00:40:51,165 --> 00:40:53,205
is also your old uni pal

727
00:40:53,365 --> 00:40:56,405
and the man that you appointed
director of public prosecutions.

728
00:40:56,565 --> 00:40:57,885
Your Honour, this is outrageous!

729
00:40:58,045 --> 00:41:00,725
Mr Greene, unless you have evidence

730
00:41:00,885 --> 00:41:04,805
of a conspiracy between
the Attorney-General and the Crown,

731
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:08,485
I cannot allow this line of
questioning to proceed.

732
00:41:08,645 --> 00:41:10,765
Your Honour,
it's painfully obvious.

733
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:14,525
Mr Greene, I have had enough.

734
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:18,365
I'll move on, Your Honour.
You better had.

735
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:23,805
Mr McGregor, why on earth
did you break into my apartment

736
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:26,445
and tell me that you'd
planted cocaine there?

737
00:41:27,525 --> 00:41:30,085
That never happened.

738
00:41:30,245 --> 00:41:32,485
But you'll agree, will you not,

739
00:41:32,645 --> 00:41:35,365
that you had me arrested
on April the 2nd

740
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:38,125
for a child abduction
that never took place.

741
00:41:38,285 --> 00:41:40,165
Oh, I don't know what you're
talking about, Mr Greene.

742
00:41:40,325 --> 00:41:41,165
I see.

743
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:44,565
So you know nothing of my arrests,
variously,

744
00:41:44,725 --> 00:41:48,805
for, uh, car theft, sexual assault,

745
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:50,725
uh, desecration of a church,

746
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:53,045
burning down a kindergarten.

747
00:41:53,205 --> 00:41:56,165
On each of these occasions,
no charges were actually pressed.

748
00:41:56,325 --> 00:41:58,605
This is all pure fiction,
Mr Greene.

749
00:41:58,765 --> 00:42:00,085
I see, Mr McGregor.

750
00:42:00,245 --> 00:42:02,085
So let's be very clear here.

751
00:42:02,245 --> 00:42:05,645
What you're saying is that you
never directed your police force

752
00:42:05,805 --> 00:42:09,725
to harass or intimidate me
in any way?

753
00:42:09,885 --> 00:42:13,165
That is exactly what I'm saying,
Mr Greene.

754
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:16,365
You're aware, Mr McGregor,
that you're under oath here.

755
00:42:16,525 --> 00:42:17,965
Of course.

756
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,845
I would never abuse my office

757
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:23,525
or the trust of the people of
this great state in that way.

758
00:42:28,405 --> 00:42:30,765
No further questions, thank you,
Your Honour.

759
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:33,125
Very well.
You may be excused, Mr McGregor.

760
00:42:39,405 --> 00:42:41,525
Do you have anything else,
Mr Greene,

761
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:44,125
or can we proceed to
closing addresses?

762
00:42:44,285 --> 00:42:48,565
Um, there are one or two things,
Your Honour.

763
00:42:57,525 --> 00:42:58,965
What's this about?

764
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:01,405
I'm a friend of Cleaver Greene's.

765
00:43:01,565 --> 00:43:03,845
I'm also a barrister.

766
00:43:04,005 --> 00:43:07,845
I understand you're looking for
some free legal assistance.

767
00:43:08,885 --> 00:43:12,365
Your Honour, I call
Phillip Andrew Saunders.

768
00:43:17,085 --> 00:43:20,285
A Justin Bieber bracelet,
Constable Saunders.

769
00:43:20,445 --> 00:43:21,765
Do you remember one of those?

770
00:43:21,925 --> 00:43:24,965
Uh, Your Honour,
Mr Saunders is a former constable.

771
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:27,245
My apologies, Your Honour.

772
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:29,885
Former Constable Saunders,

773
00:43:30,045 --> 00:43:32,645
do you recall one of
these bracelets?

774
00:43:32,805 --> 00:43:34,125
I do.

775
00:43:34,285 --> 00:43:38,845
So you recall the fact
that on the 21st of February,

776
00:43:39,005 --> 00:43:42,725
you were directed to come to
my flat in order to intimidate me.

777
00:43:42,885 --> 00:43:44,205
I was.

778
00:43:44,365 --> 00:43:49,405
Who actually directed you
to attend my apartment that night?

779
00:43:49,565 --> 00:43:51,605
My watch commander.
I see.

780
00:43:51,765 --> 00:43:55,485
And did you further arrest me
on April the 2nd of this year

781
00:43:55,645 --> 00:43:57,605
in relation to the abduction
of a child?

782
00:43:57,765 --> 00:43:59,085
I did.

783
00:43:59,245 --> 00:44:01,885
Now, where did this abduction
take place?

784
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:07,365
I don't know where
the abduction took place.

785
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:08,965
We were just told to bring you in.

786
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,445
Right.

787
00:44:10,605 --> 00:44:12,245
Was I charged?
No.

788
00:44:12,405 --> 00:44:16,405
Again, my watch commander
told me to bring you in.

789
00:44:16,565 --> 00:44:19,765
Thank you,
former Constable Saunders.

790
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:22,565
Senior Sergeant Wilson,

791
00:44:22,725 --> 00:44:24,805
you were the watch commander
on the night in question.

792
00:44:24,965 --> 00:44:27,885
Is there any record of anyone
filing a complaint in this matter?

793
00:44:28,045 --> 00:44:30,245
No.

794
00:44:30,405 --> 00:44:32,965
Then why did you order my arrest?

795
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:36,085
l...I got a call from
the Deputy Commissioner's office.

796
00:44:36,245 --> 00:44:39,005
Deputy Commissioner,

797
00:44:39,165 --> 00:44:43,485
how did you come to be involved
in my arrest for child abduction?

798
00:44:43,645 --> 00:44:48,485
I received an order to arrest you
from the Minister's office.

799
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:51,965
Did this order come from
the Minister's office

800
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:54,085
or from the Minister himself?

801
00:44:55,845 --> 00:44:57,685
The Minister himself.

802
00:45:01,005 --> 00:45:03,885
At last! The truth emerges.

803
00:45:04,045 --> 00:45:07,845
That man, ladies and gentlemen,
is the true criminal in this court.

804
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:11,685
- That man is the despot who ought...
- Order! ORDER!

805
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:14,605
Mr Greene!

806
00:45:14,765 --> 00:45:16,605
I have been addicted

807
00:45:16,765 --> 00:45:20,005
to prescription medication
for the past year.

808
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:22,645
I have relied on it heavily
since the...

809
00:45:23,765 --> 00:45:26,125
..the breakdown of my marriage.

810
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:32,405
I wasn't warned of the potentially
profound side effects.

811
00:45:35,045 --> 00:45:37,325
Be that as it may, Mr McGregor...

812
00:45:39,245 --> 00:45:41,725
..I will be remanding you
on a charge of contempt

813
00:45:41,885 --> 00:45:44,645
as charges of perjury
are contemplated.

814
00:46:01,685 --> 00:46:04,245
Justice, when it is done,

815
00:46:04,405 --> 00:46:07,565
reflects well on us,
don't you reckon?

816
00:46:07,725 --> 00:46:13,165
Not just the lawyers, not just court,
but society as a whole.

817
00:46:13,325 --> 00:46:18,285
And, today, it reflects
spectacularly well

818
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:23,565
because, today, we are reminded
that no man is above the law.

819
00:46:23,725 --> 00:46:27,645
Not even the chief law officer
of this state.

820
00:46:29,565 --> 00:46:31,925
Your Honour, in these circumstances,

821
00:46:32,085 --> 00:46:34,405
I must once again move for dismissal.

822
00:46:34,565 --> 00:46:38,245
Your Honour, uh,
whilst there is clearly an issue

823
00:46:38,405 --> 00:46:42,565
of potential malfeasance
on the Attorney-General's part,

824
00:46:42,725 --> 00:46:47,805
Mr Greene has not produced
a single shred of evidence

825
00:46:47,965 --> 00:46:50,445
that any such malfeasance took part
in relation

826
00:46:50,605 --> 00:46:53,325
to this charge
of conspiracy to murder.

827
00:46:53,485 --> 00:46:54,805
Uh, Your Honour...

828
00:46:54,965 --> 00:46:56,325
Quiet, Mr Greene.

829
00:46:56,485 --> 00:46:58,285
Please, go on, Mr Crown.

830
00:46:58,445 --> 00:47:01,125
I would respectfully submit,
Your Honour,

831
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,045
that the Crown
has clearly established

832
00:47:03,205 --> 00:47:06,085
both motive on Mr Greene's part

833
00:47:06,245 --> 00:47:08,045
as well as a connection
with his co-accused,

834
00:47:08,205 --> 00:47:10,965
who told this court
that Mr Greene alone

835
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:15,485
came to him and paid him
to kill Lane Hole.

836
00:47:15,645 --> 00:47:17,565
Mr Greene.

837
00:47:17,725 --> 00:47:20,205
Do you have any tangible evidence

838
00:47:20,365 --> 00:47:25,005
that Mr McGregor conspired in
this particular matter against you?

839
00:47:25,165 --> 00:47:29,925
Your Honour, I have clearly established
a pattern of beha...

840
00:47:30,085 --> 00:47:32,365
I didn't ask about a pattern.

841
00:47:32,525 --> 00:47:35,325
Do you have actual evidence

842
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,765
of corrupt practices
on Mr McGregor's part

843
00:47:38,925 --> 00:47:41,525
in terms of this specific charge

844
00:47:41,685 --> 00:47:44,805
of conspiracy to murder?

845
00:47:48,805 --> 00:47:51,765
I take it by your silence
that you do not.

846
00:47:51,925 --> 00:47:55,045
Members of the jury,
I must warn you

847
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,925
not to let the events of today

848
00:47:58,085 --> 00:48:02,685
taint what you would otherwise consider
as solid evidence

849
00:48:02,845 --> 00:48:06,685
and I also must direct
that in contemplating your verdict,

850
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:09,765
you disregard the fact
that Mr McGregor

851
00:48:09,925 --> 00:48:12,125
was found in contempt by this court

852
00:48:12,285 --> 00:48:17,165
and disregard the fact
that he may face charges of perjury.

853
00:48:18,525 --> 00:48:22,405
You must rely on the solid evidence.

854
00:48:22,565 --> 00:48:24,605
Your Honour...

855
00:48:47,165 --> 00:48:48,845
Hi, mate.

856
00:48:49,005 --> 00:48:51,405
Hey, Dad.

857
00:48:54,805 --> 00:48:57,045
How's Tara?

858
00:48:57,205 --> 00:48:58,885
She's good.

859
00:49:00,045 --> 00:49:01,725
God says hi.

860
00:49:02,845 --> 00:49:04,165
Ah.

861
00:49:04,325 --> 00:49:06,845
Well, give him my regards.

862
00:49:07,005 --> 00:49:09,045
How long will it take for a verdict?

863
00:49:11,045 --> 00:49:13,405
Could be hours. Could be days.

864
00:49:18,885 --> 00:49:22,005
I've been thinking I might be ready
to go back to the bar.

865
00:49:23,845 --> 00:49:25,645
But defence now.

866
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:36,685
You know what I think
my problem's been?

867
00:49:39,925 --> 00:49:43,885
Ever since I was a kid,
I had this expectation

868
00:49:44,045 --> 00:49:46,325
that I should be happy
all the time.

869
00:49:48,165 --> 00:49:50,525
But there's always gonna be
unhappiness in the world.

870
00:49:52,485 --> 00:49:54,845
There's always gonna be shit
we cry about,

871
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:57,325
shit we ought to cry about.

872
00:49:59,165 --> 00:50:03,845
What business do we have wanting
to be happy 100% of the time?

873
00:50:06,925 --> 00:50:08,645
Hm?

874
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:10,645
So what do you reckon?

875
00:50:10,805 --> 00:50:15,525
70/30 — happiness and unhappiness?

876
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:24,285
That's realistic, don't you think?

877
00:50:29,605 --> 00:50:31,885
It was Nicole I had the affair with.

878
00:50:32,045 --> 00:50:34,125
Cleaver's Nicole.

879
00:50:34,285 --> 00:50:36,325
What?

880
00:50:36,485 --> 00:50:39,645
She's pregnant
and the baby's mine.

881
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,725
I don't know what
she's thinking of doing.

882
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,445
I guess this is part of the 30%.

883
00:51:06,965 --> 00:51:09,525
How say you?

884
00:51:09,685 --> 00:51:13,805
We find the defendant,
Darcy Robert Lachlan,

885
00:51:13,965 --> 00:51:16,245
guilty of conspiracy to murder.

886
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,125
We find the defendant,
Cleaver Greene,

887
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:23,045
guilty of conspiracy to murder.

888
00:51:27,005 --> 00:51:29,205
Darcy Lachlan.

889
00:51:30,405 --> 00:51:34,685
Your cooperation in this matter
does you some credit.

890
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:37,565
I sentence you
to 10 years imprisonment

891
00:51:37,725 --> 00:51:39,925
with a non-parole period
of six years.

892
00:51:41,485 --> 00:51:42,965
Cleaver Greene.

893
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:46,765
As a barrister,
you have a duty to this court.

894
00:51:46,925 --> 00:51:51,605
Your conduct has disgraced it
and yourself.

895
00:51:51,765 --> 00:51:54,125
You took the law into your own hands

896
00:51:54,285 --> 00:51:57,445
and now you must pay the penalty.

897
00:51:58,965 --> 00:52:03,245
I sentence you...
to 14 years imprisonment...

898
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:09,725
..with a non-parole period
of eight years.

899
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:20,885
