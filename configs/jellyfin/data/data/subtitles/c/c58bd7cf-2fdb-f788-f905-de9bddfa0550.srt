1
00:00:32,117 --> 00:00:33,367
<i>Come on, girls.</i>

2
00:00:38,534 --> 00:00:40,242
<i>Left. Left.</i>

3
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:42,534
<i>Left, right, left.</i>

4
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:55,576
<i>At ease.</i>

5
00:00:56,242 --> 00:00:57,576
<i>Attention.</i>

6
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,242
And now, for our Head Prefect.

7
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:15,992
Each year, we choose a student

8
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,867
who models
academic excellence and leadership.

9
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:21,449
For the first time ever,

10
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,700
our Head Prefect is
from the girls' hostel.

11
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:25,992
Mira Kishore.

12
00:01:34,284 --> 00:01:35,200
Thank you, sir.

13
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:36,700
Congratulations.

14
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:38,784
- We are very proud!
- Thank you.

15
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,909
Come.

16
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:47,700
- Assembly.
- Sorry.

17
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:48,950
Attention.

18
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:52,575
Hi.

19
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,950
Okay...

20
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,450
Please say the pledge after me.

21
00:02:00,242 --> 00:02:03,325
As a student of my school,
I pledge to honor...

22
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:10,325
our age-old Indian culture
and live according to it.

23
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:16,950
It shall be my constant endeavor...

24
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:21,325
to abide by the rules...

25
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,034
of my school.

26
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:32,575
I warned you yesterday.
Arms up!

27
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,200
- Why do you have wrong socks?
- I forgot to wear.

28
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:37,949
- Are they in the hostel?
- Yes.

29
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,367
Please go change them.

30
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:41,825
She started it.

31
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,659
- Don't lie, you did.
- Shut up!

32
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:46,700
I don't want to know.
Just not during the pledge, okay?

33
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:48,659
Now, two rounds of the field.

34
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:50,200
And tie your hair.

35
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,450
Fine, I'll take it off.

36
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:01,034
- Congratulations, Mirabai.
- Thank you.

37
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,825
You are very annoying.

38
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:19,950
- May I come in, sir?
- Yes, come in.

39
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:24,575
- 11.
- Congrats, Mira.

40
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,950
Work hard.

41
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,450
Mira.

42
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:36,825
I'm going to be very strict with you

43
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:40,200
because you'll get me
100 out of 100 in the boards.

44
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:41,409
Yes?

45
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:42,700
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:44,950
19 out of 20.

47
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:48,534
- And that is the highest.
- Oh, highest!

48
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:52,450
Mira.

49
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,159
Mira!

50
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,367
14. Good.

51
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:56,742
Can you call her?

52
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,409
Can I see your test paper?

53
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,034
- Can you pass it to him?
- 16...

54
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:06,034
Good.

55
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:08,825
Srinivas?

56
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,242
Yes?

57
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:11,659
8.

58
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:15,700
I thought you to be
from an international school.

59
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,617
10... You need to work harder.

60
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,825
- Hi.
- Hi.

61
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,825
Can you use your special powers
to put this up for me?

62
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,075
Sure.

63
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,700
Flyers stay up for a week.

64
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:55,450
Can I help?

65
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:21,325
It's not really a two-person job.

66
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:27,992
Ah...

67
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,325
Wait.

68
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:38,408
Flyers stay up for a week.

69
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:40,617
You can ask for an extension
if you want.

70
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:45,034
Thank you.

71
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,617
<i>Hi!</i>

72
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,034
Hello!

73
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,325
Please take.

74
00:06:10,242 --> 00:06:11,284
Hi!

75
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,450
Congratulations, ma'am.

76
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,867
Hello, I'm Mira's mom.

77
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:19,617
Thank you so much!

78
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:21,950
Hi, come!

79
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:24,825
I'll explain the rest of the keys later.

80
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,159
There is my Head Prefect!
Hi, sweetie! Come.

81
00:06:31,284 --> 00:06:32,784
I'm so proud!

82
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,325
So proud!

83
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,700
Some older teachers
didn't think a girl could do it.

84
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:40,700
Give some sweets to the oldies.

85
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:44,575
In our times,
girls were not even considered.

86
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,700
No chance.

87
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,534
This one's going to prove them wrong.

88
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,075
Thank you, ma'am.

89
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,658
- See you later.
- Alright.

90
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:53,617
Bye.

91
00:06:56,075 --> 00:06:57,450
Ma, you've to wait at the gate.

92
00:06:57,575 --> 00:06:59,325
Parents aren't allowed inside campus.

93
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:01,075
But ex-students are!

94
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,575
Okay, you forgot your sweater.

95
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,450
Ani Aunty. Hi!

96
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:06,909
Hi, dear.

97
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:11,200
Miss Prefect has
been lecturing me already.

98
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:12,575
Same!

99
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,950
Just like her dad.

100
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:18,700
Let's go.

101
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,950
You can look into this
and I'll help you focus.

102
00:08:39,075 --> 00:08:40,159
Okay.

103
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:46,034
Uh...

104
00:08:46,784 --> 00:08:47,825
You can...

105
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:51,659
Oh... oh, wow!

106
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:55,492
- Better?
- That's beautiful!

107
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,825
Okay, boys. Come on!

108
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,700
Okay, come on. Pack up now.

109
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Hello, ma'am.

110
00:09:12,325 --> 00:09:14,492
- How was it?
- Quite informative.

111
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,075
Any of the other girls
from 12th come?

112
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:19,950
I asked the senior girls but...

113
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:23,034
It's okay. What can one do?

114
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,325
- Hi, ma'am.
- Hi.

115
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:28,450
They were really interested,
they had so many questions.

116
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:29,575
Thank you.

117
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,159
Hands-on learning is best.

118
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:33,034
Some teachers don't care but...

119
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,700
Come on, Nisarg. Let's go.

120
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:38,575
Okay, boys. Come on.

121
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:41,325
I'll bring those boys.

122
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:42,825
And lock up.

123
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,325
Okay.

124
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,700
- Just lock the gate.
- Alright.

125
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:50,700
I'll bring this to you.

126
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:57,825
Boys, back to the dorm.

127
00:09:58,909 --> 00:09:59,950
Quickly!

128
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,409
You are clearly cold.

129
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:37,284
Thanks.

130
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,825
Aren't you feeling cold?

131
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:41,659
I am.

132
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:43,617
Do you want to share?

133
00:10:44,492 --> 00:10:46,200
Maybe we can sit...

134
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:50,575
Um...

135
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:55,242
For ten minutes.

136
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:56,950
Ten minutes.

137
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:11,950
How did you get into astronomy?

138
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,325
We had a club
back in my Hong Kong school.

139
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,784
Do you miss that school?

140
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:27,825
Sometimes.

141
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:29,950
It's different here.

142
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:32,325
A lot of rules.

143
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:37,700
But you seem to like the rules.

144
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:44,409
Mira...

145
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:48,159
- I have a question for you.
- Okay.

146
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:51,534
- But you'll have to answer it honestly.
- Alright.

147
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:54,325
Why did you stay back?

148
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,825
I wanted to help pack.

149
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,075
I think you didn't hear me.

150
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:10,575
What if we made a rule

151
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:15,659
that we be honest with each other?

152
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:18,075
No bullshit.

153
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:21,909
Why did you stay back?

154
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:25,200
I don't know.

155
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,325
I wanted to help pack up, but...

156
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,075
I thought...

157
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:33,700
we could talk,

158
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,659
get to know each other.

159
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:39,534
What do you want to know?

160
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,950
How about a secret?

161
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:48,784
Okay.

162
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:51,575
The first thing
that came to my mind.

163
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:55,534
I was a total mamma's boy.

164
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,200
And for me, she was the best

165
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,950
and the smartest.

166
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:02,075
I followed her everywhere.

167
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:04,700
This one time,

168
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,242
she was changing
and I walked in.

169
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,575
That was the first time
I'd seen a naked woman.

170
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,909
Oh my god!

171
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:17,825
I ran out immediately, screaming.

172
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,659
That's the last time I followed her.

173
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:27,200
I don't know
why I said that. I'm...

174
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:28,575
Okay.

175
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:30,450
Your turn.

176
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,492
Thinking of something?

177
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:41,950
So...

178
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:45,325
I was always losing my things

179
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,950
and...

180
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,950
my mom would get mad.

181
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,200
And in 5th standard,

182
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:55,450
I lost my sweater,

183
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:58,534
my water bottle
and my new sweater.

184
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:01,825
So, I did not want to tell her.

185
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,200
And there was this girl
I didn't like,

186
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,325
so I took her sweater.

187
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:10,450
And she got punished
for wrong uniform.

188
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,284
And I still feel very bad for her.

189
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Are you still scared of your mom?

190
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:19,409
No.

191
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:24,575
Now I just can't stand her.

192
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,909
Don't say anything
if my mom picks up.

193
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:46,950
Okay.

194
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:49,742
I'll do one ring and cut?

195
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,825
Okay.

196
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,825
I'll see you.

197
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:57,284
Bye.

198
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:05,200
Can I... kiss you?

199
00:15:05,617 --> 00:15:06,492
No.

200
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,450
I didn't mean to...

201
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,825
That's fine.

202
00:15:12,075 --> 00:15:14,325
- You sure?
- I'm sure!

203
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,909
Okay.

204
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:23,325
That was so cute!

205
00:15:23,534 --> 00:15:24,575
Thank you.

206
00:15:25,284 --> 00:15:26,575
You're welcome.

207
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:27,950
Bye.

208
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,075
Where the hell were you?

209
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,450
I'm going to fail.
I don't understand this gene therapy.

210
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:57,825
I was in the astronomy club.

211
00:16:00,034 --> 00:16:01,409
I'm so brain-dead.

212
00:16:01,575 --> 00:16:02,784
What's wrong?

213
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:05,450
Give. I'll teach you.

214
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,950
What is this astronomy club?

215
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:14,909
It's a new club started
by Ms. Bansal

216
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:17,159
and this new boy Srinivas.

217
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,950
Good morning, ma'am.

218
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:25,575
- Good morning.
- The key.

219
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,450
Why didn't you return it last night?

220
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:31,117
Ma'am, I thought I'd disturb you, so...

221
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,909
You know students are not allowed
to have this key in the night.

222
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:36,492
Apologies, ma'am.

223
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:42,075
Anyway...

224
00:17:42,242 --> 00:17:44,617
- Can you get the senior girls?
- Sure, ma'am.

225
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:58,617
Priya.

226
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,034
Take that chair and place it here.

227
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,659
Now climb up on it.

228
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:18,159
This is what it looks like
when you climb stairs.

229
00:18:19,784 --> 00:18:21,950
Mira, place the other chair
next to her.

230
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:28,784
Please climb up on it.

231
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,159
Yes, ma'am.

232
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,409
This is the correct length.

233
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,659
Uniforms to your knees.

234
00:18:41,325 --> 00:18:42,784
Pull up your socks.

235
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:44,284
Come on.

236
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:46,450
Now! Pull up your socks.

237
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,075
Socks!

238
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:51,825
Also, girls, be careful with boys.

239
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,700
Don't talk to them
more than necessary.

240
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:55,909
How idiotic.

241
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:59,034
You're getting older,
you need to be careful.

242
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
You understand?

243
00:19:05,534 --> 00:19:08,284
That's it.
You can go. Dismissed.

244
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:09,825
Come on.

245
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:19,200
It's really hot.

246
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:22,284
- It's supposed to be a little hot.
- It's a lot hot!

247
00:24:08,284 --> 00:24:10,450
<i>So have you had a boyfriend before?</i>

248
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:12,700
No one interested me ever.

249
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:16,284
<i>Well, high standards
for the Head Prefect.</i>

250
00:24:16,784 --> 00:24:18,034
What about you?

251
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:20,867
<i>I had a girlfriend in Hong Kong.</i>

252
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,825
She was a senior.

253
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,784
How long were you two together?

254
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,575
<i>Eight months.</i>

255
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:29,825
<i>Are you jealous?</i>

256
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,325
I don't care.

257
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:33,950
<i>Mira?</i>

258
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:36,825
<i>Mira.</i>

259
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:40,325
Coming.

260
00:24:49,284 --> 00:24:50,700
Who were you talking to?

261
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:52,075
What?

262
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,950
Who were you talking to?

263
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,950
I was studying.

264
00:24:57,117 --> 00:24:58,867
I heard you. Don't lie.

265
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:00,450
Who was it?

266
00:25:05,825 --> 00:25:06,700
Hel--

267
00:25:10,784 --> 00:25:11,825
Who is this?

268
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,450
A friend.

269
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,284
A friend?

270
00:25:17,075 --> 00:25:18,325
At this time?

271
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,450
- You want ice cream with this?
- No.

272
00:25:57,034 --> 00:25:58,450
One or two?

273
00:25:58,575 --> 00:25:59,534
One.

274
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,575
Which practice test
are you doing today?

275
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:12,200
Physics.

276
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,700
Good.

277
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:31,159
Who were you talking to last night?

278
00:26:34,034 --> 00:26:35,200
A friend.

279
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:37,450
Please be honest with me.

280
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:42,575
I talked to Dad today morning.

281
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,284
Not about this. I'm not stupid.

282
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,450
They're trying to convince Riddhi.

283
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:56,909
I told them it's too late now.

284
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,034
They put a lot of restrictions on her

285
00:27:00,784 --> 00:27:03,159
and now she's refusing to come home.

286
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:07,450
I don't want you
to have to hide something from me.

287
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:10,034
I'm not hiding anything from you.

288
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,909
Then who were you talking to?

289
00:27:13,075 --> 00:27:14,408
I told you! A friend.

290
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:15,492
A boy.

291
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:21,034
What's his name?

292
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:39,200
It changes the voice.

293
00:27:42,284 --> 00:27:43,116
<i>Hello?</i>

294
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:45,575
Hello. Can I speak to Srinivas
from Veer House?

295
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:46,950
<i>And you are?</i>

296
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:48,659
His aunt.

297
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:49,950
<i>One minute.</i>

298
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:54,200
<i>Call Srinivas Ram.</i>

299
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:55,700
<i>Hello?</i>

300
00:27:57,825 --> 00:27:58,825
What?

301
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:01,034
<i>- I've called him.</i>
- Yes.

302
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,074
<i>- Please hold.</i>
- Yes, no problem.

303
00:28:03,075 --> 00:28:04,284
I'm holding.

304
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,574
- Hi.
- Hey.

305
00:28:35,575 --> 00:28:37,200
Just say we're friends, okay?

306
00:28:37,534 --> 00:28:38,450
What?

307
00:28:40,575 --> 00:28:42,700
Hi, Aunty. I'm Sri.

308
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,950
Hi, I'm Mira's mom, Anila.

309
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:50,659
I saw these flowers
and thought they were really pretty.

310
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,284
Thanks.
Mira, put these in a vase.

311
00:28:55,659 --> 00:28:56,534
Come sit.

312
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,950
- Bring some water also.
- Okay.

313
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:02,784
I didn't know
you have such an amazing garden.

314
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,909
It's my mom's.
This house is my mom's.

315
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,325
Mira was saying you split your time
between here and Haridwar?

316
00:29:12,534 --> 00:29:14,575
I always come for her exams.

317
00:29:14,784 --> 00:29:17,825
But this year is very important, so...

318
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,659
I'll be here until her board exams.

319
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,284
My daughter's my priority,
whether she realizes it or not.

320
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,617
Have.

321
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,700
Thank you.

322
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:34,242
- That's why I wanted to ask--
- Do you miss Haridwar?

323
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,367
No.

324
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,200
Not really.

325
00:29:39,284 --> 00:29:42,325
- What do your parents do?
- My father is a diplomat.

326
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,825
And my mother is a dancer.

327
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,325
She also teaches Bharatnatyam.

328
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,700
You were in Hong Kong before?

329
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:55,200
Yes, Aunty, for three years.

330
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,950
Before that, Dubai, Cairo, all over.

331
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,825
How do you like it here?

332
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,909
It's okay.
But the food is terrible.

333
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:08,325
Mira...

334
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,200
get your clothes ready for laundry.

335
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:12,825
I'll do it later.

336
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:16,450
He's coming early
for your uniform, go.

337
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,950
We're just friends.

338
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:36,742
I won't allow anything
more than a friendship.

339
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,950
Of course.

340
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,616
I just want
to get to know her and...

341
00:30:40,617 --> 00:30:42,409
I don't know many people here.

342
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,742
I don't even have a local guardian.

343
00:30:45,575 --> 00:30:47,659
But this can't affect her academics.

344
00:30:48,284 --> 00:30:49,700
I wouldn't want that.

345
00:30:59,575 --> 00:31:01,700
Nice color for a principal, no?

346
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:03,950
Yes, I like it too.

347
00:31:12,825 --> 00:31:15,159
It's hard being new
in boarding school.

348
00:31:19,534 --> 00:31:21,659
Maybe I can take some food for him?

349
00:31:21,825 --> 00:31:23,700
You can invite him for lunch.

350
00:31:24,325 --> 00:31:25,825
He's a nice boy.

351
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:34,200
He's very mature for his age.

352
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,159
What are you whispering about?

353
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:18,409
Mira.

354
00:33:18,575 --> 00:33:20,575
Do you mind
if I see what you've done?

355
00:33:26,617 --> 00:33:27,742
Behave, she is your
bhabhi (sister-in-law).

356
00:33:29,825 --> 00:33:31,700
Seriously, we were only kidding.

357
00:33:40,575 --> 00:33:41,784
Be careful when you sit.

358
00:33:42,075 --> 00:33:44,200
They can see up your skirt.

359
00:33:49,034 --> 00:33:50,075
I'm sorry.

360
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:56,325
Foreign fucker!

361
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:13,825
Mira.

362
00:34:16,784 --> 00:34:18,159
I got this for you.

363
00:34:23,284 --> 00:34:24,409
Open it, please.

364
00:34:25,784 --> 00:34:27,700
Sorry, I can't accept it.

365
00:34:35,617 --> 00:34:36,617
Why?

366
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,200
I'm not interested.

367
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:44,825
I thought we were friends.
I share my notes with you.

368
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,950
I also share my notes with you.

369
00:34:51,075 --> 00:34:53,909
Just think about it?
At least open it once.

370
00:34:55,492 --> 00:34:56,742
No, Hardik.

371
00:35:24,575 --> 00:35:25,575
Priya.

372
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:27,950
- Hi, Vikrant.
- Hi.

373
00:35:55,492 --> 00:35:56,950
Happy 18th Miss Mira.

374
00:36:49,492 --> 00:36:50,492
Hi, Mira.

375
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,325
Eat a lot and help out a bit.
She'll like it.

376
00:37:01,575 --> 00:37:02,659
Thank you.

377
00:37:03,784 --> 00:37:06,409
You've no idea
how much I've missed home food.

378
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,200
So what was our school like
back then?

379
00:37:20,492 --> 00:37:21,367
Well...

380
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:25,159
There were two schools:
one for boys, one for girls.

381
00:37:27,409 --> 00:37:30,825
And we could meet only on Sports Day
and Teacher's Day.

382
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,284
Do you know Teacher's Day?

383
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,700
Seniors become teachers, right?

384
00:37:34,825 --> 00:37:36,867
Yes, this year you will be a teacher.

385
00:37:37,117 --> 00:37:39,117
Mira's going to be the principal.

386
00:37:39,534 --> 00:37:41,992
But you met the boys
only twice a year?

387
00:37:43,075 --> 00:37:44,574
- Well...
- No way.

388
00:37:44,575 --> 00:37:45,909
I can't believe it!

389
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,159
I mean...

390
00:37:48,825 --> 00:37:50,784
some girls did mad things.

391
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,075
Like?

392
00:37:52,284 --> 00:37:54,034
Come on. You have to tell us!

393
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,325
Okay, I can tell you.

394
00:37:56,534 --> 00:37:58,284
But don't get any ideas.

395
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,700
"Mira, don't get any ideas!"

396
00:38:02,409 --> 00:38:03,784
So...

397
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,700
there was this boy who liked me.

398
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:09,825
And he hid in the girls' garden.

399
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,159
I think he wanted to propose.

400
00:38:13,075 --> 00:38:15,825
But then it rained
and they caught him

401
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,325
and I said no to him.

402
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:21,325
She's too cool for him.

403
00:38:23,325 --> 00:38:25,825
- You want more lemon rice?
- Yes, a bit more.

404
00:38:26,575 --> 00:38:27,825
Thank you.

405
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:38,825
So who are you like,
your dad or mom?

406
00:38:40,909 --> 00:38:41,950
I don't know.

407
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:46,950
My parents do their thing
and I do mine.

408
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:51,575
My dad might forget
I'm in the 12th grade but...

409
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:52,950
we're friendly.

410
00:38:55,075 --> 00:38:56,659
Who is this one like?

411
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,825
She thinks she's like her dad.

412
00:39:01,825 --> 00:39:03,825
I think she wants to be like her dad.

413
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:06,200
No?

414
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:28,992
Good one, man.

415
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,450
Do you like it?

416
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,700
We got it!

417
00:39:54,534 --> 00:39:55,575
Thank you.

418
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,700
Ma'am?

419
00:39:57,075 --> 00:40:00,533
Pratik, Vikrant and Hardik
have been taking pictures of girls

420
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:01,992
while they go upstairs.

421
00:40:03,242 --> 00:40:06,367
That's why I insist so much
on the school uniforms.

422
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,950
Can we do something about it?

423
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:16,409
Best strategy is to just ignore.

424
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:18,700
Don't give too much attention.

425
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,950
But the younger girls get scared.

426
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,450
Picking a fight can
make it worse for the girls.

427
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,284
Can't be everywhere,
can't supervise 24/7.

428
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,325
What about suspension?

429
00:40:37,325 --> 00:40:39,325
Suspension is serious, Mira.

430
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:54,950
Thank you.

431
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:03,534
I'll talk to the principal.

432
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,450
You talk to the girls.

433
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,659
They don't want
these photos circulating.

434
00:41:09,825 --> 00:41:10,950
Right, ma'am.

435
00:41:11,075 --> 00:41:12,825
Thank you so much, ma'am.

436
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:27,700
Five thousand more.

437
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
What? I need to shop.

438
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:33,200
Also for Mira.

439
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,284
What do you want, Mira?

440
00:41:40,825 --> 00:41:41,825
Books.

441
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,200
Yeah, right!

442
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,075
Did they find Riddhi?

443
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,950
Your cousin ran away with some guy.

444
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,450
The police will find her.

445
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:58,200
They know he's her music teacher.

446
00:41:59,075 --> 00:42:01,950
- What's the point now?
- What do you mean?

447
00:42:02,325 --> 00:42:04,825
She can't throw away her life like this.

448
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:06,159
Right?

449
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,200
Did she like the guy?

450
00:42:11,284 --> 00:42:12,534
She's 21.

451
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:14,909
She doesn't know what she likes.

452
00:42:19,825 --> 00:42:21,200
You also didn't know?

453
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,450
He proposed to me when he was 21.

454
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,159
I also didn't know.

455
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,700
It's a little short.
I should try something bigger?

456
00:42:51,075 --> 00:42:53,034
No, this looks good on you.

457
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:57,075
- Isn't it the right size for her?
- Yes.

458
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:58,909
We also have other colors.

459
00:42:59,075 --> 00:42:59,950
See?

460
00:43:02,825 --> 00:43:04,450
Can you see my panty line?

461
00:43:06,075 --> 00:43:07,075
Turn.

462
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:10,909
You can wear seamless panties.

463
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,825
This cut is good for you.

464
00:43:14,909 --> 00:43:17,159
I'm going to try these capris.

465
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,034
Come, dear.

466
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:33,950
Come.

467
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:39,075
Study.

468
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,575
In an hour or so,
I'll bring strawberry milkshake.

469
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,617
Wow!

470
00:43:46,075 --> 00:43:47,825
Keep the door open.

471
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,575
Sit.

472
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,200
Ready to study?

473
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,784
See? I can't focus!

474
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,909
Okay, let me quiz you

475
00:44:45,075 --> 00:44:46,700
and I'll learn from your answers.

476
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:52,200
Ready?

477
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:57,700
The first law of...

478
00:44:59,325 --> 00:45:00,241
Mendel!

479
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:03,409
Mendel's first law of inheritance is
the law of dominance.

480
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,659
Correct.

481
00:45:07,075 --> 00:45:08,909
An example of a dominant trait?

482
00:45:09,075 --> 00:45:11,450
Skin pigmentation and eye color.

483
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:25,950
Snapdragon or <i>Mirabilis jalapa</i>
flower color exhibits?

484
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:28,200
Incomplete dominance.

485
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:41,409
Red-colored flowers
and white-colored flowers

486
00:45:41,575 --> 00:45:43,034
produce pink flowers.

487
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,784
<i>Mirabilis jalapa.</i>

488
00:45:56,034 --> 00:45:58,075
I won't if you don't want me to.

489
00:45:59,409 --> 00:46:00,825
It's not that.

490
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,450
Then?

491
00:46:07,409 --> 00:46:09,534
My breasts...

492
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:12,825
are a little saggy,

493
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:16,450
so I'm wearing a push-up bra.

494
00:46:20,575 --> 00:46:22,325
You're perfect the way you are.

495
00:47:13,409 --> 00:47:14,450
I'm sorry.

496
00:47:15,325 --> 00:47:16,575
It's okay.

497
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,700
This is good, right?

498
00:47:18,909 --> 00:47:20,034
It is!

499
00:47:21,575 --> 00:47:23,950
I got surprised.
I didn't know.

500
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:28,700
Do you want to know?

501
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,700
Let's finish the chapter first

502
00:47:41,075 --> 00:47:43,575
and then we can have fun.

503
00:47:44,075 --> 00:47:45,075
Okay.

504
00:47:45,575 --> 00:47:46,825
I'll quiz you.

505
00:47:52,825 --> 00:47:55,950
I think I'll take a break now.

506
00:47:56,575 --> 00:47:59,450
I'll come back
and then we can study the chapter.

507
00:47:59,659 --> 00:48:01,325
And then you can quiz me.

508
00:48:02,325 --> 00:48:03,659
I'm slowing you down.

509
00:48:03,825 --> 00:48:05,409
No, you're not.

510
00:48:10,075 --> 00:48:12,950
Your studies cannot suffer, remember?

511
00:48:42,742 --> 00:48:44,117
We both played badminton.

512
00:48:44,409 --> 00:48:47,700
So we could meet and talk in the bus
going to competitions.

513
00:48:48,075 --> 00:48:50,450
But Harish always fell asleep.

514
00:48:50,575 --> 00:48:52,034
How romantic!

515
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,909
Yeah, we couldn't be seen in public.

516
00:48:55,117 --> 00:48:57,742
My mom would've murdered me
if she found out.

517
00:48:58,450 --> 00:48:59,950
First me and then him.

518
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:01,950
Where's my milkshake?

519
00:49:03,325 --> 00:49:04,575
In the kitchen.

520
00:49:10,825 --> 00:49:12,450
And when she found out?

521
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:14,325
She got really angry.

522
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,700
I told her I was going
to marry him and then...

523
00:49:17,825 --> 00:49:19,409
I just left home.

524
00:49:20,534 --> 00:49:23,200
That's so gutsy.
Mira, did you know about this?

525
00:49:25,534 --> 00:49:28,700
She's giving me a look
because I'm supposed to be studying.

526
00:49:30,075 --> 00:49:31,200
I'm not.

527
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:36,700
- Want more milkshake?
- Yes, please.

528
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:12,950
You know this song?

529
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,575
Mirabilis!

530
00:52:04,575 --> 00:52:05,700
Tiny steps.

531
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:07,075
Sorry.

532
00:52:07,284 --> 00:52:09,034
- You see this hand...
- Okay.

533
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:10,575
Yeah.

534
00:52:15,575 --> 00:52:16,825
Sorry.

535
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,700
Follow my lead.

536
00:52:19,909 --> 00:52:22,034
Mira, put your hand here.

537
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:26,075
You swing?

538
00:52:27,909 --> 00:52:30,075
Okay move, I'll show you.

539
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,075
Your mom's a pro!

540
00:52:56,825 --> 00:52:59,325
I'll see you
at the parents-teachers' meeting.

541
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:02,575
Your parents are coming, no?

542
00:53:07,825 --> 00:53:08,825
Bye.

543
00:53:30,575 --> 00:53:32,700
That's Anjali.
She's also a prefect.

544
00:53:32,825 --> 00:53:35,825
- Hi. How are you, dear?
- I'm fine.

545
00:53:36,325 --> 00:53:38,950
Yes, Principal sir.
I'll take care of it.

546
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:41,825
Don't worry.

547
00:53:45,409 --> 00:53:48,075
What the hell was that,
you've embarrassed me before everyone.

548
00:53:48,575 --> 00:53:50,200
What the hell!

549
00:53:50,825 --> 00:53:52,075
What's going on?

550
00:53:53,325 --> 00:53:54,533
- I don't know.
- Come home, this time my slippers

551
00:53:54,534 --> 00:53:55,992
- will meet your face.
- Is this why you go to school?

552
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,784
Do you come to study
or take photos?

553
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,159
Tell me!

554
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,491
I can never buy
anything for myself,

555
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,909
I spent my whole salary
on your fees.

556
00:54:15,034 --> 00:54:16,575
Nothing to report here.

557
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:19,075
She's doing wonderfully.

558
00:54:20,075 --> 00:54:22,200
Studies are most important.

559
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:30,450
Mira?

560
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:35,117
Priya is always with Vikrant these days.
You must have noticed.

561
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:38,075
I know, they're friends.

562
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:42,075
It's hard to discipline friends.
But you have to be fair.

563
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,450
No favorites.

564
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:48,325
Right, ma'am. I understand.

565
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:51,034
I talked to her, but she said
they're just friends, so...

566
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,575
It's bad for her.

567
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,034
This boy, you know what he's like.

568
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,075
I mean,

569
00:54:56,284 --> 00:54:57,575
especially him!

570
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,700
Yeah.

571
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:02,700
I don't want to involve
her parents, it'll become messy.

572
00:55:02,825 --> 00:55:04,034
Right.

573
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,700
You please talk to her.

574
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:08,534
- Yes?
- Okay, ma'am. I'll talk to her.

575
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,409
- I have your word?
- Yes, ma'am.

576
00:55:10,575 --> 00:55:12,825
- Okay, enjoy your break.
- Thank you, ma'am.

577
00:55:13,034 --> 00:55:15,659
- See you in a week.
- See you, ma'am. Bye-bye.

578
00:55:47,659 --> 00:55:49,075
Wait, go up.

579
00:55:57,367 --> 00:56:00,367
This isn't an exam
you can come first in.

580
00:56:01,075 --> 00:56:02,450
I know.

581
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,409
But I want to be prepared.

582
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:09,325
I didn't think about it
but females have three orifices.

583
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,284
Me neither.

584
00:56:19,325 --> 00:56:20,784
Hey, put your headphones on.

585
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:28,284
- Sorry. Porn is a key activity here.
- It's fine.

586
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:29,950
- You okay?
- Yup.

587
00:56:37,825 --> 00:56:40,284
"The clitoris has thousands
of nerve endings

588
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:44,075
"and becomes engorged
when aroused."

589
00:56:44,659 --> 00:56:46,075
Do you know the clitoris?

590
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,700
Head Prefect Mira!

591
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:53,325
I want to learn
about male anatomy.

592
00:56:54,075 --> 00:56:55,325
That's so easy!

593
00:56:55,534 --> 00:56:58,200
We should be learning about condoms.

594
00:56:58,450 --> 00:56:59,575
Yeah, but...

595
00:57:00,825 --> 00:57:02,534
I want to know what to do.

596
00:57:04,867 --> 00:57:07,034
I'm glad we're learning this together.

597
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:08,659
Me too.

598
00:57:52,825 --> 00:57:54,075
You're going out?

599
00:57:54,325 --> 00:57:55,242
Yes.

600
00:57:55,409 --> 00:57:56,700
Movie with Priya.

601
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,450
Wearing this?

602
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,200
- Harish!
- Just asking.

603
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:08,034
See all the movies you want
after the exams.

604
00:58:08,409 --> 00:58:10,242
The film is only 3 hours long.

605
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:12,242
I can't study for 24 hours.

606
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:14,909
Hey.

607
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,950
Hi, come.

608
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,450
Nice skirt.

609
00:58:23,575 --> 00:58:25,909
I knew you'd appreciate my taste.

610
00:58:26,075 --> 00:58:27,075
Hi, Ani Aunty.

611
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,075
I made dessert for Uncle.
Packed some for you.

612
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,409
- Next week, chicken.
- Thanks.

613
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,200
- Want water?
- No, I'm good.

614
00:58:34,325 --> 00:58:35,575
Hi, Uncle.

615
00:58:36,659 --> 00:58:37,575
Ready?

616
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,075
Yes, she's ready.

617
00:58:39,784 --> 00:58:41,784
I trust you, baby. Have fun.

618
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,075
- Let's go.
- Bye.

619
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,575
- Bye, Papa. See you.
- Bye.

620
00:58:52,075 --> 00:58:55,075
Pri, I think I'll skip the movie.

621
00:58:55,825 --> 00:58:58,700
I haven't studied for bio.
I've to go to Reader's.

622
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,825
Don't be such a bore.

623
00:59:01,034 --> 00:59:02,450
It'll be fun. Just come.

624
00:59:02,659 --> 00:59:03,825
No, Pri.

625
00:59:06,034 --> 00:59:07,450
Everyone is coming.

626
00:59:07,909 --> 00:59:09,700
And Hardik wants to talk to you.

627
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,075
Why?

628
00:59:11,575 --> 00:59:13,158
Because you got them suspended.

629
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:15,867
I didn't get them suspended.
Principal sir decides that.

630
00:59:16,075 --> 00:59:19,784
They know you went and told Bansal.
What did Hardik do?

631
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:22,909
Enjoy the movie.

632
01:01:06,825 --> 01:01:07,950
You okay?

633
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:10,867
I'm good.

634
01:01:25,075 --> 01:01:26,575
Did I do something wrong?

635
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:28,950
No.

636
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:40,909
- Was it because I touched you?
- No.

637
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,700
You knew what to do.

638
01:01:49,325 --> 01:01:52,200
Did you practice it somewhere?

639
01:01:53,325 --> 01:01:55,700
I told you about my ex-girlfriend.

640
01:01:58,284 --> 01:01:59,284
Right?

641
01:02:01,575 --> 01:02:03,200
So it was back then?

642
01:02:04,284 --> 01:02:05,200
Yes.

643
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:09,200
Mira, it was before I knew you.

644
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,074
But in the internet cafe,

645
01:02:13,075 --> 01:02:17,617
you were acting as if
you don't know about things.

646
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:20,950
And...

647
01:02:21,409 --> 01:02:23,075
You know what to do.

648
01:02:24,825 --> 01:02:26,159
I don't understand.

649
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:29,575
Why would you lie?

650
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,450
I feel silly.

651
01:02:32,659 --> 01:02:34,824
It's like you were secretly
laughing at me.

652
01:02:34,825 --> 01:02:35,950
I wasn't.

653
01:02:36,367 --> 01:02:38,367
I was having so much fun.

654
01:02:39,117 --> 01:02:41,242
And you were so sweet
with your notes.

655
01:02:43,867 --> 01:02:45,992
But I didn't consciously lie, Mira.

656
01:02:47,325 --> 01:02:49,242
I'm really sorry if it hurt you.

657
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,034
I want to learn how to touch you.

658
01:03:15,034 --> 01:03:16,075
Yeah.

659
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:18,284
I can show you.

660
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:19,950
It's very simple.

661
01:03:33,992 --> 01:03:35,117
Hi, Ma.

662
01:03:46,117 --> 01:03:47,367
Do you know the time?

663
01:03:48,534 --> 01:03:49,784
I went to Reader's.

664
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,325
You said 3 hours to your father.

665
01:03:55,909 --> 01:03:57,575
Who all were at the movies?

666
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:59,242
The usual gang.

667
01:04:00,325 --> 01:04:01,784
Should I call Priya?

668
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:02,825
Call.

669
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:05,325
I didn't go to the movie.

670
01:04:06,284 --> 01:04:08,700
Priya invited Hardik and the boys.

671
01:04:09,034 --> 01:04:11,950
And they were angry at me
because I got them suspended.

672
01:04:12,075 --> 01:04:13,200
For what?

673
01:04:13,992 --> 01:04:15,200
They were taking...

674
01:04:15,825 --> 01:04:18,575
inappropriate pictures of girls,
troubling them.

675
01:04:19,075 --> 01:04:20,534
So I reported them.

676
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,200
Then where did you go?

677
01:04:24,909 --> 01:04:26,325
I went to Reader's.

678
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,659
There were new practice tests.

679
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:33,659
Show me your tests.

680
01:04:34,784 --> 01:04:36,284
I didn't buy them.

681
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,200
I just read them there.

682
01:04:42,909 --> 01:04:43,950
Here.

683
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:05,075
When Sri comes tomorrow,
study in different rooms.

684
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,284
Okay?

685
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:09,909
Why?

686
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:12,784
We really help each other revise.

687
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:16,325
Mira, if your studies suffer,
your dad will blame me. Not you.

688
01:05:21,825 --> 01:05:24,075
I got full marks in my last test.

689
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,325
You are...

690
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:29,159
- Can you stop that?
- No, I have a lot of work to do.

691
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:32,075
Don't use my studies as an excuse!

692
01:05:32,325 --> 01:05:34,200
Don't abuse my trust, Mira.

693
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:40,284
Put that skort for wash.
You have nothing else to wear?

694
01:07:02,825 --> 01:07:03,950
You...

695
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:20,117
Torture!

696
01:07:20,534 --> 01:07:22,200
Somebody cut it off.

697
01:07:37,617 --> 01:07:38,783
Sri, dear...

698
01:07:38,784 --> 01:07:41,617
Can you step outside
so I can take my clothes?

699
01:07:41,867 --> 01:07:42,742
Yes.

700
01:07:45,075 --> 01:07:48,034
Actually, no.
Just close your eyes.

701
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:49,450
Okay.

702
01:08:03,825 --> 01:08:05,075
Now open.

703
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:05,534
I wanted to revise with him,
I finished a chapter.

704
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,200
Revise on your own.

705
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,825
He said he slept late.
Let him rest.

706
01:09:20,909 --> 01:09:22,199
I'm sorry, I can get up.

707
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,700
No, no. Sleep.

708
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:26,575
But I'm going to lie down
for some time. Okay?

709
01:09:29,825 --> 01:09:31,325
Switch off the fan.

710
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:27,575
It wasn't easy back then, so...

711
01:10:28,575 --> 01:10:30,825
If you were together,
you got married.

712
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:33,492
There was no concept of break-up.

713
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,574
Would've been terrible
if I'd married my first girlfriend.

714
01:10:37,575 --> 01:10:38,492
Why?

715
01:10:38,992 --> 01:10:42,784
She liked me, but she liked mostly
that I paid for stuff.

716
01:10:43,575 --> 01:10:45,159
Good that you broke up then.

717
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:48,534
When you're young,
it's just puppy love.

718
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,450
I mean, it doesn't last.

719
01:10:50,742 --> 01:10:53,242
Then what? Nothing, no romance.

720
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:54,784
Hi.

721
01:10:56,784 --> 01:10:58,159
Did we disturb you?

722
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:01,450
Your mom's imparting her
wisdom on romance.

723
01:11:01,909 --> 01:11:03,409
She's an expert, you know!

724
01:11:04,659 --> 01:11:05,825
It's because of these.

725
01:11:06,034 --> 01:11:07,700
- Okay, let's see.
- Stop it!

726
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:09,825
"Cassandra looks at Brandon.

727
01:11:10,034 --> 01:11:12,200
His smoldering eyes burn into her."

728
01:11:12,409 --> 01:11:13,950
"Make her knees go weak."

729
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:16,450
- "He looks so good in that suit."
- Enough!

730
01:11:16,575 --> 01:11:18,700
I need to know what happens
to those smoldering eyes.

731
01:11:18,825 --> 01:11:22,200
- I'll gift it to you. Birthday gift.
- Gift it to Harish.

732
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,950
Good idea.

733
01:11:26,075 --> 01:11:28,200
You bought this trash
with his money.

734
01:11:38,075 --> 01:11:39,075
Do you want tea?

735
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:41,450
- Always.
- Come.

736
01:12:02,659 --> 01:12:05,325
Are your parents going to come
for your birthday?

737
01:12:06,034 --> 01:12:08,409
No, they have to go to Hong Kong.

738
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:12,034
Here, less sugar.

739
01:12:12,284 --> 01:12:13,284
Thank you.

740
01:12:15,284 --> 01:12:17,284
Wow, you've added cardamom too.

741
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:28,200
So what do you want to do
for your birthday?

742
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:31,200
I just don't want to stay
in the hostel.

743
01:12:42,575 --> 01:12:43,659
Hi.

744
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:46,325
I have an idea.

745
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:50,034
Let's go to our mountain
for a little pre-birthday celebration?

746
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,575
I love you.

747
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:59,200
Maybe it's puppy love...

748
01:13:01,325 --> 01:13:03,450
maybe it's big-dog love.

749
01:13:49,325 --> 01:13:50,325
Sri!

750
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:51,700
Wait.

751
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,200
Come.

752
01:14:10,534 --> 01:14:11,950
- Hi.
- Hi.

753
01:14:13,075 --> 01:14:14,284
Listen to this.

754
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,700
I'll finish quickly
and meet you at the gate?

755
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:20,200
- For what?
- Just meet me at the gate.

756
01:14:46,075 --> 01:14:48,575
Pri? Can I talk to you
for a minute?

757
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,825
- What happened?
- Come.

758
01:15:02,075 --> 01:15:03,409
- So...
- What's wrong?

759
01:15:04,075 --> 01:15:05,325
Teachers have noticed

760
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:08,325
you're spending a lot of time
with Vikrant these days.

761
01:15:09,659 --> 01:15:10,784
You're reporting me?

762
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:14,784
No, I'm just letting you know
so that they don't tell your mom.

763
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:17,950
Bansy should mind her own business.

764
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:20,575
Don't hang out
with him so much.

765
01:15:21,075 --> 01:15:22,409
He's not the right person.

766
01:15:22,575 --> 01:15:24,409
I'm doing nothing wrong!

767
01:15:24,575 --> 01:15:26,700
That's why it's all out in the open.

768
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:31,700
What about you and that boy Sri?

769
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:34,575
When were you going to tell me?

770
01:15:35,075 --> 01:15:36,075
What?

771
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,325
Mira, I have eyes.

772
01:15:42,325 --> 01:15:44,325
Why don't you tell Bansy about that?

773
01:16:00,617 --> 01:16:01,659
What should I do?

774
01:16:04,825 --> 01:16:06,784
Don't worry about it.
We'll handle it.

775
01:16:08,117 --> 01:16:09,617
She is crossing her limits now.

776
01:16:11,742 --> 01:16:12,742
Keep it quiet, okay.

777
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:10,075
Hi, Mira.

778
01:17:11,075 --> 01:17:12,950
You know your mom just saved me.

779
01:17:13,909 --> 01:17:15,825
I'm here for you, you know that?

780
01:17:16,075 --> 01:17:17,409
I do, Anila.

781
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:20,200
I'll make some tea.

782
01:17:21,075 --> 01:17:22,325
Are you hungry?

783
01:17:28,075 --> 01:17:30,325
We also tried on
my Teacher's Day outfit.

784
01:17:32,075 --> 01:17:33,534
I waited for you.

785
01:17:34,325 --> 01:17:35,950
You saw Ms. Bansal...

786
01:17:36,784 --> 01:17:39,575
I figured it would be safest
to meet here.

787
01:17:41,742 --> 01:17:43,367
Did you listen to the tape?

788
01:17:45,034 --> 01:17:46,784
I didn't have my Walkman.

789
01:17:47,825 --> 01:17:49,409
But I'll listen to it tonight.

790
01:17:52,325 --> 01:17:54,075
Will you tell me what you said?

791
01:17:56,409 --> 01:17:57,700
Listen to it.

792
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:00,200
How was class?

793
01:18:05,325 --> 01:18:06,825
What were you talking about?

794
01:18:06,992 --> 01:18:08,742
To Anila? Just...

795
01:18:10,075 --> 01:18:12,075
some money stuff.

796
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:14,825
And about my parents.

797
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:17,200
Nothing important.

798
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,700
You don't want to talk to me?

799
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,950
Mira, it's not...

800
01:18:27,284 --> 01:18:28,575
Of course I do.

801
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:35,575
I needed help and it's easier
to talk to your mom about some things.

802
01:18:35,784 --> 01:18:37,450
I'm sure she loves it!

803
01:18:45,075 --> 01:18:47,409
Why are you being so mean to her?

804
01:18:49,325 --> 01:18:51,575
She's doing all this just for you.

805
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:55,034
She's trying so hard
to be a good mom.

806
01:18:57,075 --> 01:18:59,200
You seem to know a lot about her.

807
01:18:59,409 --> 01:19:00,284
I'm just saying...

808
01:19:02,409 --> 01:19:05,700
that it's good
if she feels liked and appreciated.

809
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:09,450
That's how we get to meet
and the only way we get to meet.

810
01:19:10,534 --> 01:19:13,575
You being rude is not going to help us.

811
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,325
And about the tape, I'm sorry.

812
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,075
I'll listen to it tonight.

813
01:19:25,575 --> 01:19:26,575
Tea's ready.

814
01:19:27,575 --> 01:19:28,659
Come in.

815
01:19:31,575 --> 01:19:32,950
Promise, okay?

816
01:19:33,075 --> 01:19:34,075
Come.

817
01:19:39,825 --> 01:19:41,325
Hello?<i>-Hello?</i>

818
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:45,159
I'm calling to authorize
a night-out for Srinivas from...

819
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:46,324
Veer.

820
01:19:46,325 --> 01:19:48,200
From Veer House tomorrow.

821
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,575
<i>- For what reason?</i>
- It's his birthday.

822
01:19:50,784 --> 01:19:53,034
<i>- Who are you?</i>
- His aunt.

823
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,325
<i>Okay, please hold.</i>

824
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:33,325
Make a wish.

825
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:38,450
Happy birthday!

826
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,325
Happy 19th!

827
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:23,575
Get ready for a nighttime visitor.

828
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:25,284
What?

829
01:21:29,534 --> 01:21:30,409
Terrace.

830
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:47,950
This is not comfy at all.
You'll get a backache.

831
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:51,409
I'm used to the hostel rooms.
I can sleep anywhere.

832
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:54,034
Sleep in Mira's room,
she can sleep in mine.

833
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,700
There's enough beds for everyone.

834
01:21:55,825 --> 01:21:57,825
No, Mira should have her room.

835
01:21:57,950 --> 01:21:59,409
The sofa is great, honestly.

836
01:21:59,575 --> 01:22:01,325
I can't sleep with you, you snore.

837
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:04,450
- Don't exaggerate. It's not that bad.
- It is.

838
01:22:04,575 --> 01:22:06,784
In that train, you were very loud.

839
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:08,950
You can handle it for one night.

840
01:22:09,075 --> 01:22:10,409
I have a test tomorrow.

841
01:22:10,575 --> 01:22:11,700
Mira!

842
01:22:14,075 --> 01:22:15,450
I'm not going to, Ma.

843
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:23,659
Well then,
Sri, you can sleep in my bedroom

844
01:22:23,825 --> 01:22:25,825
and the princess can sleep in hers.

845
01:22:26,034 --> 01:22:28,034
Anila, I don't think
that's necessary.

846
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,825
I think it's for the best.

847
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:32,784
We have to wake up at five to study.

848
01:22:33,325 --> 01:22:35,534
We'll disturb you,
it's best if he's here.

849
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:38,450
I'll also wake up.
I'll make you tea.

850
01:22:40,575 --> 01:22:41,950
Don't you think it's weird?

851
01:22:42,075 --> 01:22:42,992
Why?

852
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,909
You've napped there before, no?

853
01:22:46,075 --> 01:22:48,033
And the bed is comfortable, right?

854
01:22:48,034 --> 01:22:50,742
Okay, come. Take your stuff.

855
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:52,450
Get up.

856
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:57,575
Come.

857
01:22:59,034 --> 01:23:00,909
Wake me at five, no matter what.

858
01:23:01,075 --> 01:23:02,700
We'll go to the terrace.

859
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:13,825
- Is this side okay for you?
- Yes.

860
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:40,075
Good night.

861
01:24:05,075 --> 01:24:06,284
What is it?

862
01:24:06,909 --> 01:24:08,575
- Leave it open.
- Why?

863
01:24:09,075 --> 01:24:10,658
So that I can wake him up.

864
01:24:10,659 --> 01:24:13,825
You can knock.
You think I don't see what's going on?

865
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:14,450
Sri...

866
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:17,284
It's five.

867
01:25:18,659 --> 01:25:19,700
Wake up.

868
01:25:21,534 --> 01:25:23,159
You wanted to revise, no?

869
01:25:23,825 --> 01:25:25,325
30 minutes.

870
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:34,075
Okay, I'll come at 5:30.

871
01:25:57,575 --> 01:26:00,200
It's 5:30. Wake up!

872
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,450
- Already?
- Yes.

873
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:07,700
Give me 15 minutes. I'll come.

874
01:26:25,325 --> 01:26:27,325
Come on, it's past six.

875
01:26:27,575 --> 01:26:28,575
Get up!

876
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:30,325
Softer, please.

877
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:33,325
I can't keep coming to wake you up.
I have to study.

878
01:26:33,534 --> 01:26:35,409
- You study.
- Sri!

879
01:26:35,575 --> 01:26:36,909
Let him be.

880
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,950
You said, "Wake me, no matter what."

881
01:26:43,325 --> 01:26:45,034
You go. I'll come.

882
01:27:21,825 --> 01:27:22,950
Omelet.

883
01:27:34,492 --> 01:27:37,242
- Where's Mira?
- She's outside.

884
01:27:47,992 --> 01:27:49,075
Hi.

885
01:27:56,325 --> 01:27:58,075
Mira, I'm really sorry.

886
01:27:59,784 --> 01:28:02,325
I was so tired,
I couldn't open my eyes.

887
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:09,034
Your mom was talking to me.

888
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,700
It got so late...

889
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,700
Should I get on top?

890
01:30:22,575 --> 01:30:23,700
Mira.

891
01:30:43,367 --> 01:30:46,742
It's not that I'm not turned on.
I definitely am.

892
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:49,200
Just a second.

893
01:31:11,909 --> 01:31:12,950
Keep going.

894
01:32:42,325 --> 01:32:44,117
87 out of 100.

895
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:46,200
Not even close.

896
01:32:52,409 --> 01:32:53,450
77.

897
01:33:09,075 --> 01:33:11,658
Ma'am, can you help me
drape my sari?

898
01:33:11,659 --> 01:33:12,867
Yes, ma'am.

899
01:33:19,950 --> 01:33:22,075
- Mom's sari?
- Yes, ma'am.

900
01:33:22,284 --> 01:33:23,450
Very elegant.

901
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:26,159
I've never seen your mom
wear a sari.

902
01:33:26,909 --> 01:33:28,075
Turn around.

903
01:33:28,659 --> 01:33:30,325
- Hi, Ani Aunty!
- Hi!

904
01:33:30,534 --> 01:33:31,950
Looking nice.

905
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:34,409
Turn around again.

906
01:33:40,409 --> 01:33:42,950
Mira, I brought your jewelry.

907
01:33:43,325 --> 01:33:44,534
Put it there.

908
01:33:54,034 --> 01:33:56,159
I can take it from here.
You can relax.

909
01:33:56,325 --> 01:33:58,784
- That's not a problem.
- We already started it.

910
01:34:00,909 --> 01:34:02,700
Don't make her work on Teacher's Day.

911
01:34:03,450 --> 01:34:05,825
We practiced a drape at home.

912
01:34:07,034 --> 01:34:08,200
I'll go help the others.

913
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:10,575
Tell me if you need something.

914
01:34:18,367 --> 01:34:20,742
Like we tried?

915
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:24,075
- Tight pleats.
- No need to do that.

916
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:45,409
Here, let me put it for you.

917
01:34:45,784 --> 01:34:47,159
- Give.
- I'll put it.

918
01:34:47,325 --> 01:34:48,700
- Give it to me.
- I'll put it.

919
01:34:48,825 --> 01:34:50,617
- Give it to me!
- I'll do it.

920
01:34:51,409 --> 01:34:52,825
I will do it.

921
01:34:57,950 --> 01:34:59,534
- Sorry.
- Go away!

922
01:35:19,825 --> 01:35:20,950
Here.

923
01:35:24,367 --> 01:35:26,450
Bye, I'll see you later.

924
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:49,950
Look at this girl. All grown up!

925
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:51,699
- Happy Teacher's Day.
- Thank you.

926
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:53,825
Beautiful earrings! Coming?

927
01:35:54,034 --> 01:35:56,284
- They're starting some games.
- Yes, coming.

928
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:05,950
Sri?

929
01:36:06,075 --> 01:36:07,700
I have your blazer.

930
01:36:08,284 --> 01:36:10,784
- Thank you. See you soon.
- Yeah.

931
01:36:13,409 --> 01:36:15,450
Your mother is friendly
with Srinivas?

932
01:36:16,034 --> 01:36:17,575
She's friendly with everyone.

933
01:36:19,159 --> 01:36:20,700
You're friends with him, too?

934
01:36:23,075 --> 01:36:25,950
It's important to have friends
who have similar goals.

935
01:36:32,575 --> 01:36:33,700
And...

936
01:36:34,492 --> 01:36:37,117
These are your keys for the day,
Miss Principal.

937
01:36:37,325 --> 01:36:38,575
Thank you, ma'am.

938
01:36:39,075 --> 01:36:40,284
I'll see you later.

939
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,784
Classes, attention!

940
01:36:52,075 --> 01:36:53,200
At ease!

941
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,409
Miss Principal will say some words.

942
01:36:58,575 --> 01:37:00,700
She's going to speak now.

943
01:37:00,909 --> 01:37:01,825
Hi.

944
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:05,200
Today, we honor our teachers

945
01:37:05,575 --> 01:37:06,909
and do their work.

946
01:37:07,575 --> 01:37:10,950
So enjoy your day
and listen to your teachers.

947
01:37:12,034 --> 01:37:13,325
Now, the school pledge.

948
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:16,325
- Anybody wants to come up?
- Nobody will go up!

949
01:37:17,075 --> 01:37:17,909
No.

950
01:37:22,117 --> 01:37:24,367
Miss Principal will do the pledge.

951
01:37:24,575 --> 01:37:26,325
Nice one, Hardik!

952
01:37:31,825 --> 01:37:34,284
Alright. I'm still a student.

953
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:36,450
So please repeat the pledge after me.

954
01:37:36,575 --> 01:37:37,700
Yeah, sure!

955
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:41,325
As a student of my school,
I pledge to honor...

956
01:37:43,284 --> 01:37:44,784
Who the hell was that?

957
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:46,700
Shut up.

958
01:37:47,075 --> 01:37:50,700
...our age-old Indian culture
and live according to it.

959
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:54,200
Kids in the front, shut up!

960
01:37:59,075 --> 01:38:00,075
Come on.

961
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:02,450
It shall be my constant endeavor...

962
01:38:02,784 --> 01:38:04,284
Now she knows who's the boss!

963
01:38:06,867 --> 01:38:08,534
It's done. Let's leave, guys.

964
01:38:09,034 --> 01:38:09,950
Boo!

965
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,450
Everyone, leave!

966
01:38:19,284 --> 01:38:20,575
That was fun.

967
01:38:22,575 --> 01:38:24,075
Where will you run?

968
01:38:24,325 --> 01:38:26,450
Miss Principal, bye!

969
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:29,659
She left?

970
01:38:30,325 --> 01:38:31,450
Well played.

971
01:38:31,575 --> 01:38:34,909
Where are you off to, Princy?

972
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:05,075
Mira.

973
01:39:08,075 --> 01:39:10,784
Nobody saw me coming.
I checked.

974
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:13,825
You alright?

975
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:17,075
Those guys are idiots.

976
01:39:17,575 --> 01:39:19,367
Who the fuck cares about them?

977
01:39:20,534 --> 01:39:22,075
I know you don't care.

978
01:39:22,825 --> 01:39:24,450
You didn't say the pledge.

979
01:39:25,825 --> 01:39:27,409
You know I never say it.

980
01:39:28,784 --> 01:39:31,200
If pledging would've fixed things,
I would've.

981
01:39:36,075 --> 01:39:37,159
Mira...

982
01:39:37,575 --> 01:39:39,200
I don't want to go down.

983
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:43,034
I'll get you the rooftop keys.

984
01:39:43,575 --> 01:39:44,700
From where?

985
01:39:45,075 --> 01:39:46,200
Bansal.

986
01:39:47,325 --> 01:39:48,700
I won't tell her it's for you.

987
01:39:48,825 --> 01:39:51,159
- She won't give them to you.
- She will.

988
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:55,075
Why?

989
01:39:56,075 --> 01:39:59,950
Because people also have keys
and Bansal's not that complicated.

990
01:40:01,950 --> 01:40:03,075
See you soon.

991
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:42,075
There she is.
We have spotted the principal.

992
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:44,450
Come on.

993
01:40:46,284 --> 01:40:47,659
Principal!

994
01:40:48,575 --> 01:40:50,450
Let's mess with her.

995
01:40:57,200 --> 01:40:59,284
Principal,
we're ready to say the pledge.

996
01:40:59,450 --> 01:41:01,075
"As a student of my school..."

997
01:41:01,284 --> 01:41:03,200
"To abide by the rules," right?

998
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:06,075
Where's she going?

999
01:41:06,450 --> 01:41:07,325
Mira!

1000
01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:10,450
Principal, why are you rushing?

1001
01:41:10,575 --> 01:41:12,075
Hey, wimp!

1002
01:41:17,492 --> 01:41:19,242
- There she is!
- Let's go.

1003
01:41:19,367 --> 01:41:22,200
- Mira!
- Got me suspended, huh?

1004
01:41:22,659 --> 01:41:25,117
- Why are you running?
- Wait!

1005
01:41:27,617 --> 01:41:28,992
Boys, run!

1006
01:41:30,909 --> 01:41:32,825
Boys, she's running to the girls' dorm!

1007
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:34,950
Mira, wait!

1008
01:41:35,409 --> 01:41:37,450
Catch her before she goes inside!

1009
01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:46,159
Hardik, don't go in.

1010
01:41:46,534 --> 01:41:47,700
Listen, hey!

1011
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:50,074
Hey!

1012
01:41:50,075 --> 01:41:52,034
Listen to me.
I want to talk to you.

1013
01:41:53,909 --> 01:41:55,575
I just want to talk to you.

1014
01:41:59,034 --> 01:42:01,950
I know everything about you
and your astronomy. Bitch!

1015
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:03,950
<i>Open or I'll break the door!</i>

1016
01:42:04,825 --> 01:42:06,408
<i>Now you're scared!</i>

1017
01:42:07,825 --> 01:42:09,575
<i>You've broken my bro's heart.</i>

1018
01:42:10,325 --> 01:42:12,450
<i>I'll show you
what you're worth!</i>

1019
01:42:14,534 --> 01:42:17,825
Ma! Can you come pick me up?<i>-What happened, Mira?</i>

1020
01:42:17,950 --> 01:42:19,075
Come fast.

1021
01:42:19,284 --> 01:42:22,075
<i>- Where? At the gate?</i>
- In the girls' dorm.

1022
01:42:22,284 --> 01:42:23,950
<i>- Okay, I'm coming.</i>
- Okay.

1023
01:42:24,075 --> 01:42:25,784
<i>Call your astronomer!</i>

1024
01:42:26,825 --> 01:42:28,950
<i>Answer, bitch!
Or are you too scared?</i>

1025
01:42:29,825 --> 01:42:32,200
<i>What a fucking slut, man!</i>

1026
01:42:32,784 --> 01:42:35,450
<i>Stop hiding, coward!</i>

1027
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:41,075
<i>We're not going anywhere.</i>

1028
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:56,325
What are you boys doing here?

1029
01:42:57,325 --> 01:42:59,825
You're not supposed to be here.
What's going on?

1030
01:43:01,075 --> 01:43:02,325
Where's Mira?

1031
01:43:08,659 --> 01:43:11,950
- What?
- Mira and that NRI boy, Sri.

1032
01:43:12,284 --> 01:43:13,534
What about them?

1033
01:43:13,909 --> 01:43:15,200
Ask her, you will know.

1034
01:43:15,325 --> 01:43:18,700
Tell me what's going on.
I want to know why you boys are here.

1035
01:43:18,909 --> 01:43:21,117
Can't even tell you ma'am,
imagine the worst,

1036
01:43:21,867 --> 01:43:22,825
can't even say it.

1037
01:43:27,492 --> 01:43:28,534
What the hell!

1038
01:43:28,742 --> 01:43:30,866
- What the fuck, Priya!
- What?

1039
01:43:30,867 --> 01:43:32,409
What were you doing?

1040
01:43:40,867 --> 01:43:43,492
Has this boy Sri
been coming to your place?

1041
01:43:44,409 --> 01:43:46,159
- No.
- Mira...

1042
01:43:47,450 --> 01:43:49,117
I know you very well.

1043
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,325
Don't lie to me.

1044
01:43:51,534 --> 01:43:53,450
Ma'am, Hardik proposed to me.

1045
01:43:53,575 --> 01:43:56,284
I said no, and this is how
he's taking his revenge.

1046
01:43:59,950 --> 01:44:01,325
Yeah, coming.

1047
01:44:01,909 --> 01:44:03,325
Just a minute.

1048
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:09,575
What happened?

1049
01:44:11,034 --> 01:44:12,325
They chased me.

1050
01:44:13,075 --> 01:44:14,450
I want to go home.

1051
01:44:15,034 --> 01:44:17,034
- You okay?
- I want to go home.

1052
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:18,200
Okay.

1053
01:44:18,784 --> 01:44:22,450
- Who chased you?
- The boys outside. They're still there.

1054
01:44:23,825 --> 01:44:25,575
Mira has complained
about them before.

1055
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:27,325
They were even suspended.

1056
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:29,034
This is a separate matter.

1057
01:44:31,075 --> 01:44:33,450
They think that Mira
and this boy Srinivas...

1058
01:44:33,659 --> 01:44:35,825
- I think you know him?
- Yeah.

1059
01:44:36,825 --> 01:44:38,367
They say that...

1060
01:44:39,034 --> 01:44:42,034
Mira has been quite inappropriate.

1061
01:44:42,409 --> 01:44:44,700
- How so?
- Having relations with Sri.

1062
01:44:45,284 --> 01:44:47,159
And you believe these rumors?

1063
01:44:48,284 --> 01:44:49,825
I wanted to talk to her.

1064
01:44:50,034 --> 01:44:52,409
If it were true,
then it would mean expulsion.

1065
01:44:52,784 --> 01:44:54,200
Those boys are hooligans.

1066
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:57,200
Mira's been the top student
here since years.

1067
01:44:57,325 --> 01:45:00,659
She's the Head Prefect.
How are you trusting them over her?

1068
01:45:00,825 --> 01:45:02,825
Her performance dipped
in the last tests.

1069
01:45:02,950 --> 01:45:04,825
In one test!
She was sick.

1070
01:45:05,034 --> 01:45:08,825
It seems that this with Sri
has been going on for a while.

1071
01:45:10,200 --> 01:45:13,325
- And he's been coming to your place.
- So?

1072
01:45:16,117 --> 01:45:18,367
I decide who comes to my home.

1073
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:22,575
Anyway, thank you.

1074
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:24,075
Come, Mira. Let's go.

1075
01:45:47,325 --> 01:45:48,325
Get up.

1076
01:47:11,575 --> 01:47:13,450
Hi, Anila.
How are you?

1077
01:47:16,659 --> 01:47:18,783
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

1078
01:47:18,784 --> 01:47:19,742
Come.

1079
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:28,034
I did come back to the rooftop

1080
01:47:28,450 --> 01:47:30,700
but you had already left by then.

1081
01:47:33,450 --> 01:47:35,325
I did get you the rooftop keys.

1082
01:47:35,575 --> 01:47:37,950
- From Miss Bansal?
- I told you.

1083
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:39,950
What did you tell her?

1084
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:43,784
Just that I wanted to teach
a class on the terrace and...

1085
01:47:43,950 --> 01:47:46,825
how she's the only teacher
I learnt anything from.

1086
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:48,450
Is it true?

1087
01:47:49,825 --> 01:47:50,784
No.

1088
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:51,950
But...

1089
01:47:52,825 --> 01:47:54,200
she likes hearing that.

1090
01:47:56,575 --> 01:47:59,325
So you just said it like that?

1091
01:47:59,825 --> 01:48:01,200
You didn't mean it?

1092
01:48:02,325 --> 01:48:03,200
No.

1093
01:48:09,575 --> 01:48:13,075
What do you mean when you say,
"People also have keys"?

1094
01:48:14,325 --> 01:48:16,825
Sometimes it's an actual rooftop key.

1095
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:21,284
But when you said it that day,

1096
01:48:21,617 --> 01:48:22,992
what did you mean?

1097
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:27,325
It's just understanding
how people work,

1098
01:48:28,075 --> 01:48:29,700
what they really want.

1099
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:44,075
What about me?

1100
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:47,200
- Do I have a key?
- You do.

1101
01:48:49,075 --> 01:48:50,159
What is it?

1102
01:48:51,409 --> 01:48:53,950
No bullshit. That's your key.

1103
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:55,825
It's a good one.

1104
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:07,325
I also want to know this key thing.
What is it?

1105
01:49:09,534 --> 01:49:10,659
Nothing.

1106
01:49:12,159 --> 01:49:13,575
What's my key?

1107
01:49:15,575 --> 01:49:18,825
You really like it
when I enjoy your food. Right?

1108
01:49:22,534 --> 01:49:23,700
That's my key?

1109
01:49:24,075 --> 01:49:25,075
I think so.

1110
01:49:35,909 --> 01:49:36,909
Food?

1111
01:49:38,659 --> 01:49:40,909
What? You asked me to eat a lot.

1112
01:49:41,075 --> 01:49:42,450
I have been doing that.

1113
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:47,075
No bullshit.

1114
01:49:49,825 --> 01:49:50,950
What is it?

1115
01:49:52,325 --> 01:49:53,825
Tell me the truth.

1116
01:49:55,950 --> 01:49:57,075
You know her...

1117
01:49:57,575 --> 01:49:58,950
She needs attention.

1118
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:02,450
That works in our favor though.

1119
01:50:05,534 --> 01:50:07,075
So you're using her?

1120
01:50:07,950 --> 01:50:10,700
No! But that's how we get to meet.

1121
01:50:12,325 --> 01:50:13,700
Come on, Mira.

1122
01:50:14,075 --> 01:50:15,700
It's nothing you don't know.

1123
01:50:33,950 --> 01:50:35,950
Can I come back next week?

1124
01:52:47,950 --> 01:52:49,075
You want oil?

1125
01:52:58,242 --> 01:52:59,242
Mira!

1126
01:52:59,450 --> 01:53:01,200
Sorry, sorry!

1127
01:53:03,325 --> 01:53:04,284
Hold this.

1128
01:54:11,575 --> 01:54:13,534
Oil will come on your face.
