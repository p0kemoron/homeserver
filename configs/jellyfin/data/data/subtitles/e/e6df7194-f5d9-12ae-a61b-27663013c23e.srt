00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,253
["The Dream" playing on headphones]

2
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,763
[knocking]

3
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:13,847
Yeah?

4
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,062
Kyle, can we talk to you for a second?

5
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,440
Your mother's here with me too.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,608
Hi, honey.

7
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:29,947
[Rusty exhales sharply]

8
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:33,992
Um...

9
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,707
[breathes shakily]
Kyle, there's a picture of your bike

10
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,253
at Carolyn's house
on the night of May 18th.

11
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,004
Why were you there?

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,008
I have no idea what you're talking about.

13
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,097
[Barbara] Honey...

14
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,935
I wasn't. I must've just been riding by.
That's all I--

15
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,646
- [Barbara] Baby.
- Okay. Kyle, there was a photograph of--

16
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,983
of you at Carolyn Polhemus's house
the night of May 18th.

17
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,234
Why were you there?

18
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,780
Honey, we got these images
from the police,

19
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,158
so they have this evidence too.

20
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,911
You gotta be honest. It's important now.

21
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,916
Oh, my God. For God's sake, Kyle,
why were you there?

22
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,338
I guess I wanted to
get a sense of the there.

23
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,926
[Rusty] The what?

24
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,845
[Kyle] Where you were going.

25
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,222
So, you knew about
your father and Carolyn?

26
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,099
I heard you two fighting about it.

27
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,268
[Barbara sighs] Okay.

28
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,854
Does your sister know? Does Jaden--
Does-- Does she know?

29
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,107
I didn't tell her. I don't know.

30
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,193
[Rusty] When did you
first find out about it?

31
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:50,360
[Kyle] Does that matter?

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,945
Well, I wouldn't ask you
if it didn't matter.

33
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,948
I don't remember.

34
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,075
A few months ago maybe.

35
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:02,539
Okay, so that I'm clear, you went there
to see what she looked like.

36
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,335
You know how to use Google,
so you could find a picture of her,

37
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,588
but you wanted to see where she lived.

38
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,925
- Were you casing out her house?
- Rusty.

39
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,093
[Rusty] Were you
casing out her house, Kyle?

40
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:19,556
I-- I just don't understand the reasoning
behind why you were going there.

41
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,767
Maybe I was trying to
figure out your reason.

42
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,567
- I wanna talk to Mom about this.
- No! I am your father...

43
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,236
- Rusty.
- ...and you're gonna answer--

44
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,695
Rusty, please.

45
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,405
It's okay.

46
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,491
[breathing heavily] Fine.

47
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,494
[door opens, closes]

48
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,895
[Carolyn] Bunny Davis was a daughter.

49
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:13,944
Bunny Davis was a sister,
a friend, cousin.

50
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,240
Bunny Davis was 26 years old

51
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:23,662
when she found herself alone
in a dirty motel room with a monster,

52
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,832
and she's praying-- pleading--

53
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:30,002
that this is the kind of man
who will just let her go.

54
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,422
[clicks tongue] But no.

55
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:37,968
This man, Liam Reynolds,

56
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,472
is the kind of person who does this...

57
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,352
and this...

58
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,315
and this.

59
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,701
What do you think?

60
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,330
I think you're amazing, Carolyn.

61
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:35,609
- [objects clattering]
- This thing's a fucking mess. [sighs]

62
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,031
Hey.

63
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,785
Hey. The front porch light is out.

64
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,997
So, he rode... [sighs]
...by her house a few times,

65
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,959
and he saw you going in once.

66
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,091
Obviously, we need to get him
into therapy as soon as possible.

67
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,175
Why?

68
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,386
Rusty, he's been carrying this around
for months.

69
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,972
We have no idea of the impact.

70
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,933
Okay, sure, but you and I can talk to him
about this together.

71
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:08,851
Oh, right.

72
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,061
- Like you just talked to him right now?
- We don't have to have--

73
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,521
[Rusty] What is that supposed to mean?

74
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,064
You interrogated the kid.

75
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,482
[Rusty] I interrogated him?

76
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,733
[Barbara] Yeah.

77
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,986
I-- I-- [stammers]
I was asking him questions.

78
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,698
- "Why were you casing out her house?"
- He was there, of course I was asking.

79
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,616
Asking like a prosecutor, Rusty.

80
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,660
- Are you kidding me?
- He's 15!

81
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,497
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What?

82
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,294
- You caused this, Rusty. You did.
- Of course. It's me.

83
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,088
Yes, I am the fuck-up-in-chief.

84
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,548
- [scoffs]
- But guess what.

85
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,258
You played a part in it too.

86
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:45,804
And you will, at some point,
need to take some fucking responsibility.

87
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,015
I can't do this anymore. I'm done.

88
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,225
- [Rusty] I j-just--
- Done!

89
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:06,950
[inhales sharply] In my medical opinion,

90
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,328
the cause of death
was cranial blunt force trauma.

91
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,081
So, the judge has been already told
that you're an expert,

92
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,208
so you don't need to qualify.

93
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,667
You don't need to say, "In my opinion."

94
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,127
- You can sit up straight.
- Okay.

95
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,879
- Just sit up straight.
- You don't gotta--

96
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,507
- Don't tell me how to s-- Oh.
- You're gonna give the jury

97
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,676
- your findings, right? Your expertise.
- [scoffs] Don't-- Just-- Okay, I--

98
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,012
- Wow.
- And you're not gonna make it about you.

99
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,348
What an-- No. Don't--
Don't do that. Don't do that.

100
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,141
You know,
I'm doing this bullshit exercise for you,

101
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,268
- that you got me up in the morning for...
- Which I appreciate.

102
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,938
I-- I am a medical doctor.
You're gonna respect me.

103
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,315
- [Tommy] I respect you as a doctor.
- [clears throat]

104
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,777
As a witness, however,
you are known to shit the bed.

105
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,904
[chuckles] You fucking prick.

106
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,155
[Tommy] Forget it.

107
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:49,159
[Kumagai] This is what you got me up
out of bed for? [laughs]

108
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,497
I'll get that file to you
by the way, scumbag.

109
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,795
[reporter 1] <i>The details of this case
are being kept close to the vest.</i>

110
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,380
[reporter 2]
<i>There's not been a single leak.</i>

111
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,549
[reporter 1] <i>I mean,
how strong can this case be?</i>

112
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:04,633
<i>They don't even have a murder weapon.</i>

113
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,802
[reporter 2] <i>Yeah, I don't see
how they've cleared the bar</i>

114
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,136
<i>of going beyond a shadow of a doubt.</i>

115
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,347
[reporter 1] <i>Hard to believe
this is even going to trial.</i>

116
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,392
[reporter 2] <i>You know, former colleagues
now at each other's throats...</i>

117
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,227
[reporter 3] <i>Sabich has two children...</i>

118
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,812
- [Raymond] <i>But Kyle was there.</i>
- [Rusty] <i>No.</i>

119
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,064
<i>He just-- He rode by, like I said.</i>

120
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,359
It was just-- just a few times. [sighs]

121
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,653
- We're sure he didn't kill her?
- You know, you're not funny.

122
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,113
That's not fucking funny.

123
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,865
I wasn't intending to be.

124
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:33,495
So, Michael Caldwell at Carolyn's house
the night of the murder.

125
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,331
Footage of Kyle there, a few weeks prior?

126
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,541
Jesus Christ.

127
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,169
I'm gonna have to think about this.

128
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,004
[Rusty groans] I do not have it.

129
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,924
- [sighs] Fucking--
- Is there something else?

130
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,677
I just didn't get any sleep last night,
okay, Ray?

131
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:50,846
Is that it?

132
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,516
What is it?

133
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:59,438
[stammers] Barbara and I got into it,
you know, and she said that she was done.

134
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,649
"Done" as in, "I'm gonna leave you"?

135
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,321
Come on. If she was gonna leave you,
she would've already done it.

136
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,531
- I don't need this right now.
- What would she be waiting for?

137
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,158
Good excuse?

138
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,080
- You betrayed her.
- [sighs]

139
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,790
[Raymond] You betrayed your children.

140
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,043
In fact, knowing Barbara,

141
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:24,421
the betrayal of the children
is the deeper of the two offenses.

142
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,841
[sighs] Ray, it's just-- it's complicated.

143
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,927
- Yeah. Tell me. Come on.
- It's-- It--

144
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,971
Depression, compulsion, narcissism.

145
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,222
I'll take any of that.

146
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,933
Let's send you to a doctor
and get a fucking diagnosis. [stammers]

147
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,520
But my fear is
that it'll just come back "pig."

148
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,022
[scoffs]

149
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,234
Your dick got hard for Carolyn,
you fucked her,

150
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,027
and now you wanna feel less bad about it.

151
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,197
[stammers] It's what men
who cheat do, Rusty.

152
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,618
They wanna have their cake, eat it,
and then chalk it up to complexity.

153
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,704
Jury will find it pretty simple.

154
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,124
On the plus side,
they'll also find it unoriginal.

155
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,294
It won't shock their conscience.

156
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,298
But for what it's worth, it shocked me.

157
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,010
It shocked Lorraine,
and I'm sure it shocked Barbara.

158
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:15,764
But she's still with you.

159
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,892
That tells me she means to hang in.

160
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,772
You know what? Hold on a second.

161
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,774
You know what? I--

162
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,068
How dare you say
that I don't take responsibility,

163
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:33,699
that I don't feel shame,
and that I am not consumed with guilt?

164
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:36,702
Fuck you.

165
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:45,961
You know, in 40 years, I have seen
a lot of guilt and shame in this business.

166
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,630
Shame is something
that you put on yourself.

167
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,049
It's self-absorbed, self-centered.

168
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:55,971
Guilt is more about owning and feeling
the pain that you cause others.

169
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,682
I don't doubt that you feel shame.

170
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,199
[Eugenia] Tommy--

171
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,702
Tommy, why am I on the witness list?

172
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,995
'Cause I think you have information

173
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,372
about the relationship
between Carolyn and Rusty.

174
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,502
[Eugenia] I have no information
about what happened that night.

175
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:31,173
But you might have a little information
about what happened all the other nights.

176
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:33,467
Right?

177
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:39,139
Seems to me that this is something
that really should've been reported to HR,

178
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,559
so maybe you're just wrestling
with your own culpability here.

179
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,687
Wow, you are really a miserable prick,
aren't you?

180
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:46,897
Hey, listen to me.

181
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:51,151
We're doing it for Carolyn, all right?
Just think about it. For her.

182
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:56,990
Hello, gentlemen.

183
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,326
Thanks for coming in.

184
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,703
How you doing? Get you anything?

185
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,288
You good?

186
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,792
Um, I'm not--
I'm not really comfortable with all this.

187
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,377
I completely understand. It's awful.

188
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,421
But as we're building this case
against Mr. Sabich,

189
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,549
every detail becomes enormously important,

190
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,801
and the defense is gonna come at you
with all these questions.

191
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,095
And I just wanna make sure
that we have everything exactly right.

192
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,597
Shouldn't we have a lawyer with us?

193
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,100
That's entirely up to you,

194
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,978
but I'm just confirming information
that we already discussed.

195
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,482
This is a photo you took of Mr. Sabich

196
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,359
entering your mother's house
the night she was killed.

197
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,279
It's June 16th, 9:49 p.m. Is that correct?

198
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,363
Yes.

199
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,323
And all these other photos
you took on the same night?

200
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,241
Yes.

201
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:43,078
Why didn't you take pictures
of him leaving the house?

202
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,413
I left after he went in.

203
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,124
Why were you there?

204
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,877
Sometimes I would just go.

205
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:53,505
Why?

206
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:55,424
He, uh-- He already answered that.

207
00:11:55,424 --> 00:12:00,512
Okay. It's-- We-- This is-- This is
extremely important for us to iron out,

208
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,390
because they're gonna ask
the same questions, okay? The defense.

209
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,684
Because she was my mother.

210
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,103
Sometimes I'd go look at the house.

211
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,064
You ever see anyone else
entering the house?

212
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,358
He was the only one there that night.

213
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:18,113
How did Mr. Sabich seem
as he entered the house?

214
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,573
What was his demeanor?

215
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,451
I don't know.

216
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:26,788
And during this meeting
that you had with him, how did he seem?

217
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:31,376
You said that during this meeting,
you accused him of killing your mother.

218
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,461
Is that right?

219
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,672
I mean, he denied it, but he was lying.

220
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,425
Why do you say that? How do you know that?

221
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,969
I could s-see it in his eyes.

222
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:43,347
Mm-hmm.

223
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:47,309
Also, once, she told me
she was becoming afraid of him.

224
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,854
But I thought you didn't-- When did you
have contact with your mother?

225
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:55,067
I had convinced her to meet me for lunch.

226
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,903
She seemed stressed,

227
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,739
and I got pissed off
because I thought it was me.

228
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,658
And then I asked her what was wrong,

229
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:08,455
and she said that there's a man at work
that's beginning to scare her.

230
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,584
- Did she say who this man was?
- Nah.

231
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,672
She said that she had cases with him,

232
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,758
which is why she couldn't shake him.

233
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,315
- Hey.
- Hi.

234
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,067
What can I get you?

235
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:42,239
Uh. Um, I think--

236
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:45,868
Uh, Belvedere martini.
No olives, no juice.

237
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:47,578
[chuckles]

238
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,080
- Hi.
- Hi.

239
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,043
I've been talking about you all week.

240
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,006
Nah, that's--
that's not how it sounds like.

241
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,591
[chuckles] Okay.

242
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:01,967
Shift drink, Clif?

243
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,428
Uh, I wasn't, but I will now.

244
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,016
I got these bartender hands.

245
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,976
It's messed up all the time.

246
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:14,605
How's the drama?

247
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,483
- Same old.
- Yeah? I bet. Mind if I join you?

248
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,653
- Sure, yeah.
- Yeah?

249
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:24,656
Clifton.

250
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,910
- Barbara.
- Barbara.

251
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,620
Nice to officially meet you.

252
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,371
[sniffs]

253
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,665
What is that stuff, that cream?

254
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:37,127
- Yes. This stuff. Jeanine makes it.
- Oh.

255
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,671
Yeah, it's cocoa butter infused with weed.

256
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,381
- Ah.
- Don't put your fingers in your mouth.

257
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,758
- You will get very high.
- Okay.

258
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:46,178
- [chuckles] Thank you for the heads-up.
- Of course. Indeed.

259
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,348
That is so generous. Thank you.

260
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:52,935
So tell me about your, um, tattoos.

261
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:57,064
[gasps] I ask, realizing it's very cliché
to ask about someone's tattoos.

262
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,149
Yeah. [chuckles] I get it.

263
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:02,486
Uh, this. I'm somewhat of an artist too.

264
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:07,199
Uh, mainly projection art, but I designed
this during my youthful idiocy.

265
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,701
- It's the <i>Yijing</i>.
- Oh.

266
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,911
You-- You know about that?

267
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,831
- Mmm. I know about John Cage...
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:18,752
...Brian Eno, and the random
creative operation of things.

269
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,004
Right. [chuckles]

270
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,717
I'm also very familiar
with youthful idiocy.

271
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:30,848
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

272
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:34,893
[phone buzzing]

273
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:40,858
Rigo.

274
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,025
[Rigo] <i>Guess what I got.</i>

275
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,696
A hit on the second sample
in the Bunny Davis case.

276
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:48,031
What? How did you do that?

277
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,200
I didn't find any matches
in the whole system.

278
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,495
Yeah. This fool gave his DNA
to Ancestry.com.

279
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:54,621
Brian Ratzer.

280
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:58,375
[Rusty] Ratzer. Address?

281
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,966
Do we know anything about him?

282
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:10,179
[Rigo] Not really, other than he left
a sperm sample at a homicide scene

283
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,638
involving a dead prostitute.

284
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,559
Look, thank you for doing this.

285
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,394
I know you're putting your ass
out on the line.

286
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,189
I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for Carolyn.

287
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,482
Rusty, I'm gonna need you to chill
in there, okay?

288
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,026
Do not say anything.

289
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,659
[knocking]

290
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,537
[door opens]

291
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:36,955
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hi.

292
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,249
[Rigo] Sorry to disturb you.
We're with CPD.

293
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:42,002
We're looking for Brian Ratzer.
Is he home?

294
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,171
[stutters] Uh, hon!

295
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:47,007
Um, he's down the basement.

296
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,927
Would you like to come inside
and I'll go get him?

297
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,011
[Rigo] Sure.

298
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,347
Hon.

299
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,605
- Hon?
- [power tool whirring]

300
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:04,148
- [Brian] Yeah.
- The police are here.

301
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,069
Please, have a seat. He'll be right up.

302
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,945
- [Rigo] Great. Thanks.
- [wife] Coffee?

303
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,030
Sure.

304
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,450
[clears throat]

305
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,997
[baby fussing]

306
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,715
[Brian] Hey.

307
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,343
- [Rigo] Hi.
- What can I do for you?

308
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,888
We're looking into some incidents
that happened in this area,

309
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,849
June 16th, 2019.

310
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,643
The night of. We're just canvassing.

311
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,271
What incident are you looking into?

312
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,856
Uh, some break-ins.

313
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:47,234
Not on this street.
A few miles east, on Robertson.

314
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,778
It was a Thursday night.
I know it's a while to think back, but--

315
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:53,448
I don't need to think back.
I don't know the street.

316
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:57,411
If it happened at night,
um-- I-I work nights.

317
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,122
Where do you work?

318
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,458
Hey, can I see your badge?

319
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,543
[Rigo] Sure.

320
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:07,713
It's just that, um,

321
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:10,299
- a sex worker was found murdered, so...
- [wife] Here we go.

322
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,177
[sighs] Yeah. Not-- Not now, babe, okay?

323
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,387
[stammers] I said not now.

324
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,347
[wife] Okay.

325
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,559
[baby crying]

326
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,897
What is this about exactly?

327
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:26,690
[Rigo] I just told you.

328
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,650
Where do you work, Mr. Ratzer?

329
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,569
Did you answer the question?

330
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:31,904
I don't need to answer any questions.

331
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:34,448
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to answer the questions.

332
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,493
I mean, you're gonna have to have
the conversation at some point.

333
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,541
Don't I know you from someplace?

334
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,714
Here's my card.

335
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,342
You give me a call
when you're ready to talk.

336
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,093
And if I don't?

337
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,720
[Rusty] I think you're gonna have to.

338
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:59,223
And I think you know why.

339
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,726
Or maybe we should ask your wife.

340
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,521
- Hey, Laura.
- Hey. Hey.

341
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:06,813
[Laura] Yeah?

342
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,565
- [Brian] It-- It's okay, babe.
- [Laura] Yeah?

343
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:14,112
[Laura] What's going on?
Do you need something?

344
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,324
Just wanted to say thank you
for the coffee.

345
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:20,953
[Laura] Oh. You're welcome.
Is everything okay?

346
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:22,204
Yeah. Yeah.

347
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,290
[Laura] Okay.

348
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,842
Get the fuck out of here.

349
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,971
[Rigo] I told you not to agitate him.

350
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,014
[Rusty] I just asked him one question.

351
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,434
You are un-fucking-believable.

352
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:55,654
[breathing heavily]

353
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,243
Why do you look so scared?

354
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:11,837
<i>Why do you look so scared?</i>

355
00:20:11,837 --> 00:20:15,382
[gasps, exhales sharply, sighs]

356
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:23,432
B?

357
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:34,776
- [water splashing]
- [scrubbing]

358
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,132
B, what are you doing?

359
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,510
[Barbara] Not taking any chances.

360
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,595
He was riding by her house.

361
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,307
Who's to say he didn't
walk through her garden,

362
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:09,520
look through her window,
stand on her doormat...

363
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,730
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- ...ring her doorbell?

364
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,524
Come on. Come on.

365
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,860
I don't think that Kyle is a suspect.

366
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,239
[sighs] Rusty.

367
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,409
[breathes shakily]

368
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:31,708
Sometimes I think you forget
our son is Black.

369
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,219
[sniffles]

370
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:52,813
[Dr. Rush] How did it make you feel
to see your dad go in her house?

371
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,233
You wanna talk about it?

372
00:21:58,402 --> 00:21:59,403
No.

373
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,324
- You must have feelings.
- But I don't wanna talk about them.

374
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:08,704
Kyle.

375
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,962
A lot worse shit has happened
since I saw him go in her house.

376
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,219
You kidding?

377
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,768
This is ridiculous.

378
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:37,149
[Dr. Rush] I made zero progress,
not that we often do right off.

379
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,860
Early sessions can be more
about establishing trust,

380
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,280
and I think I failed there too.

381
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:46,325
Look, speaking to the--

382
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:51,914
the bigger issue,
I think we need to redraw some lines.

383
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,625
Okay. What do-- What do you mean?

384
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:58,253
This thing has become
way too layered and loaded

385
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:03,800
for me to treat you, Rusty, Rusty and you,
and now Kyle in the midst of--

386
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,386
It-- It really should be
one therapist per.

387
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:09,139
[Barbara] Per?
Like we have that kind of money.

388
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,683
I think I should take you, and only you.

389
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:14,603
I know.

390
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:17,564
Can you s-- [stammers]

391
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:25,030
I-- I think it's possible
that you do wanna forgive Rusty

392
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,615
and stay married to him.

393
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,575
I also think it's possible--

394
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:32,329
I suspect even more likely--
that your-- your limbic system is just--

395
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:35,040
it's going full-bore.

396
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,961
You are in self-defense mode, trying
to save your marriage for your kids,

397
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:43,799
doing whatever you consciously
or unconsciously deem necessary.

398
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,760
You have always been
about preservation of family.

399
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:51,849
But I also think it's possible that when
the kids are grown or off to college,

400
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:55,978
this compulsion to forgive

401
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:58,897
could metastasize into something else,

402
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:04,236
like anger or hatred even.

403
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,322
Could be it's already happening.

404
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:09,992
[sighs]

405
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:15,205
Look, your, uh-- your husband
fell in love with another woman.

406
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:17,833
He's now facing trial for killing her.

407
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:20,878
You need your own therapist.

408
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:32,306
[Nico] <i>So,
Eugenia came by my office earlier.</i>

409
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:34,433
[Tommy] <i>What did she say?
Why? What did she say?</i>

410
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:35,350
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

411
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,769
I got no issue with you calling her
as a witness, all right?

412
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:40,189
It's just--
If she's gonna be your witness,

413
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:41,940
it might help for her to be in your camp.

414
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,025
Tell me what she said.

415
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:45,903
[stammers] She said that, uh--

416
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:47,654
She said that you're an asshole,
all right?

417
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,323
But we know you can be a little...

418
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:52,784
Okay. Listen, I'm my best
prosecutorial-self when I'm angry.

419
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:53,702
You know that.

420
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:58,081
Yeah, but if your plan is to rely on
hostile witnesses to make your case--

421
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:01,502
Eugenia will bend over
any which way she can to help Rusty.

422
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:05,088
I think she's a little in love with him.

423
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,299
I need to tell her to toe the line.

424
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:11,970
No. No, no. The line you need to toe
is one of hard evidence, all right?

425
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,139
Character assassination
is not gonna get it done.

426
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:16,308
I'll give you hard evidence. Don't worry.

427
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,853
I-I am worried. I'm worried.

428
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:22,439
Raymond's asked for a meeting.

429
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:24,650
Why? What about?

430
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,862
Well, I can only imagine it's because
he thinks he's got a play on a plea.

431
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:32,407
And if he thinks that, he must feel
that he's got us by the balls.

432
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,952
He hasn't got my balls, Tommy.

433
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,120
Has he got yours?

434
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:40,874
There's no chance of any plea.

435
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:48,340
[Rusty] No. Plus, we need to find out
if there are other sex workers in the area

436
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,300
and if they can recognize Ratzer.

437
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,803
I mean, the guy fucking knows something.
I'm sure of it.

438
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,388
- [Rigo] <i>Of course.</i>
- You ready?

439
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:56,640
- Yeah. Look, I'll call you back.
- [Rigo] <i>Sure.</i>

440
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:01,812
[Mya] Can you take me
through that night again?

441
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:04,398
You said you were
at the office that night.

442
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,151
Um, yes.

443
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,863
A few of us were working late
on Raymond's campaign,

444
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:13,991
ostensibly working on
Raymond's campaign. [chuckles]

445
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:16,994
Ostensibly?

446
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:19,663
[clears throat]
Well, I was mostly texting.

447
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:26,336
And, um-- And getting no messages back...

448
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:30,549
which I wasn't really handling very well.

449
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:36,805
<i>And she was basically ghosting me,
so I needed somewhere to go.</i>

450
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,601
[sighs]

451
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,979
And what time did you leave the office?

452
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,647
[Rusty] A little after 8:30.

453
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:49,193
So I'd sometimes eat out because I just--

454
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,571
I wasn't in any state to go home.

455
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:55,032
[chattering]

456
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,332
[patrons distorted laughter]

457
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:06,251
I don't really remember much from the bar.

458
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:09,922
[patrons chattering]

459
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:14,927
Guess I had a few things to drink.

460
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:18,096
Maybe I ordered another. I don't know.

461
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:28,232
- [phone beeps]
- <i>And then she texted back,</i>

462
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,276
{\an8}<i>and I was off to the races.</i>

463
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:37,699
So the text from her comes in at 9:24 p.m.

464
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:42,788
Michael Caldwell's photos
show you arriving at 9:49.

465
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:46,583
What happened?

466
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:51,797
Uh, I mean,
I don't know how much detail you--

467
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:55,592
- you want here, but, um...
- [doorbell rings]

468
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:57,803
Hey.

469
00:27:57,803 --> 00:27:59,513
[both breathing heavily]

470
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,932
What happened, um...

471
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:05,561
- What?
- I just--

472
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:07,938
What happened?

473
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:09,481
I don't know why you're so angry.

474
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:12,568
- What happened?
- [Carolyn moans]

475
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,154
[Rusty] Miss you so much.
Miss you so much.

476
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,699
[Rusty speaks indistinctly]

477
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:24,788
Well, mostly, we argued.

478
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:26,957
You argued?

479
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:29,334
I wanted to get back together,
and she didn't,

480
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,420
- and, I mean, that was pretty much it.
- [Carolyn] <i>Stop.</i>

481
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,380
- [Rusty] Hey.
- Leave! [echoes]

482
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:43,015
[clicks tongue] Cell metadata has you
arriving home at 11:00 on the nose.

483
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:50,439
It's a 20-minute drive from her house
to yours, which means you left at 10:40.

484
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,318
You were at her house for 51 minutes.

485
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:57,821
Long argument.

486
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,079
Get the fuck out of here.

487
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:11,919
And then you just left after that?

488
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:16,089
Then we kissed goodbye.

489
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:18,759
You kissed?

490
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,012
Yes, and then I went home.

491
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:29,353
<i>When she kissed me,
she knew that it would give me hope.</i>

492
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,905
<i>I mean, the kiss got me to the car.</i>

493
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,657
<i>It got me to go home.</i>

494
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:45,744
But when I got home, I realized that, uh--

495
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:48,580
that hope had just turned into cruelty.

496
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,292
She knew what she was doing.

497
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,880
She was fucking cruel.

498
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:08,892
So, what's your take so far?

499
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:12,980
Well, on the case,
I kind of like where we're at.

500
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,607
They'll have a hard time
making their burden.

501
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:18,527
At the same time, 51 minutes.

502
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:21,196
They'll argue it's long enough
to have tied her, cleaned the scene.

503
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:24,867
Or had sex, or argued,
or had a fight and made up.

504
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:27,411
What about Rusty?

505
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:29,663
Thoughts about putting him on the stand?

506
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:33,166
There is no way we let that man
anywhere near the witness chair.

507
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:37,212
[sighs] Agreed.

508
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,257
[Rusty] What'd we find out about Ratzer?

509
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:41,633
There's gotta be something there.

510
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,051
He got an alibi?

511
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,595
Right, no prior arrests?

512
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:47,764
<i>We use CPD in Illinois State?</i>

513
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:50,976
<i>We got nothing. All right.
Well, he was with Reynolds, right?</i>

514
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:53,312
<i>Well, he was there with Reynolds,
with Bunny Davis.</i>

515
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:55,564
We just have to fucking prove it.

516
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:57,441
Yeah, just keep-- just--
just-- just keep at it.

517
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:58,567
Just keep pushing.

518
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:01,069
Fuck.

519
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,155
[people chattering]

520
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,411
[Kumagai] Hey, Molto.

521
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:23,842
Okay. Thank you.

522
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,096
[elevator bell dings]

523
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:57,668
[line ringing]

524
00:31:58,794 --> 00:31:59,962
[Barbara] <i>Yeah?</i>

525
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:01,922
[Rusty] <i>Hey, um...</i> [sighs]

526
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:07,094
I know that we said a lot to each other
the other night.

527
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:08,220
And, um...

528
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:14,184
I just want-- I just want you to know
that I heard-- I-- I heard you.

529
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:19,606
Rusty, can we talk about this
when I get home?

530
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:22,943
I'm-- I'm just about
to step into the market.

531
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:27,823
- [Rusty sighs] Yeah, of course. Yeah.
- <i>Okay?</i>

532
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:28,907
[Rusty] Mm-hmm.

533
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:32,077
I love you.

534
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:35,163
[patrons chattering]

535
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:36,248
Love you.

536
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,841
<i>You know, I'm really starting
to understand the allure of day drinking.</i>

537
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:47,009
[Clifton] <i>You ever night drink?</i>

538
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:49,469
[Barbara] I have appearances to uphold.

539
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:50,721
Ooh. Like what?

540
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:54,600
Mom. Wife.

541
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,977
All the shit you probably
don't wanna hear about.

542
00:32:56,977 --> 00:32:58,854
[inhales sharply] Oh, on the contrary.

543
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:02,399
Yeah, I'm deeply curious
on what it's like to be you right now.

544
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,193
[Barbara] Honestly...

545
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:07,279
I don't know.

546
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:19,082
Well, if you ever want to talk
and should I not be here...

547
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:22,920
[sighs]

548
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:27,049
Thank you.

549
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:35,140
[Barbara moaning, panting]

550
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:15,304
[people chattering]

551
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,061
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey, Raymond.

552
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:22,312
- Helen.
- Hey.

553
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:25,190
[Raymond] Eugenia.

554
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,650
- [gasps] Oh, my God.
- [Raymond laughs]

555
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,862
Hi. Raymond. Oh, my God. How are you?

556
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,196
I'm hanging in. You?

557
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:33,447
[sighs] I'm on the witness list.

558
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:35,284
- I saw that.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

559
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:38,036
I, uh-- I knew about the two of 'em.

560
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,496
Well, I wouldn't lose any sleep.

561
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,040
We're not denying the relationship.

562
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,375
Okay.

563
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,918
Well, do me a favor, will you?

564
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,965
Tell Rusty I have no intent
of giving testimony against him, okay?

565
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:52,134
- I'll do that.
- Thank you.

566
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:58,140
- Hi, guys.
- Raymond.

567
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,058
It's good to see you, as always.

568
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:02,769
Yes.

569
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:05,647
Okay, let's get right to it.

570
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:09,943
You two have a really fucking lousy case,
and I think you both know it.

571
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:12,446
I mean,
it's not a complete nothing burger.

572
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:14,156
He was there, last seen with her.

573
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:16,325
That's something,
but it's shitty all the same.

574
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:17,242
We disagree.

575
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:21,622
Not a drop of her blood found
in Rusty's car, none of her DNA at all.

576
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,957
Blood and guts everywhere at her home,

577
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:26,793
not so much as a microscopic drop
in his car.

578
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,712
- [Nico] He cleaned it.
- Or on his clothing.

579
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:30,297
- Cleaned it also.
- No murder weapon.

580
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:31,215
Disposed of it.

581
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:33,300
You're not gonna be able
to settle on a theory, you know?

582
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:37,262
Being tied up like that,
that speaks to premeditation.

583
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:40,599
Death by fire poker? Heat of passion.

584
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:43,185
Right from the get-go,
your case is a fucking mess.

585
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,520
Well, we love a challenge.

586
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,188
[Raymond] I know that there is a reason

587
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:48,857
you brought
the lesser charge of obstruction,

588
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,317
and I would've done the same thing,

589
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:53,737
so you could get him on something.
'Cause walking away with nothing--

590
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:55,197
What is your point?

591
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:58,867
I can see that someone's
been directed not to speak.

592
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:03,956
- Smart.
- A-- All right, great. Please, just--

593
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:08,126
Rusty cannot risk spending
the rest of his natural life in prison,

594
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:10,212
and you cannot chance an acquittal

595
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:13,674
and the obliteration
of all of your political capital.

596
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:16,343
We'll cop to the obstruction, three years.

597
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,059
Ray, you seriously think we'll
plead it out on an obstruction charge?

598
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:25,894
Nico, you know you moved too fast.

599
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:28,397
Tommy, he was dying for a suspect.

600
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:30,941
The idea that it could
possibly have been Rusty, well...

601
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:33,151
- [laughs]
- Oh. Is that right? [chuckles] Fuck you.

602
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:36,697
Let's talk about your bigger problem
sitting right here.

603
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:39,950
You've got a shitty, circumstantial case,

604
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:44,872
first-chaired by a fucking
nickel-and-dimer, going against me.

605
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:46,540
You're not stupid, Nico.

606
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,417
I'm giving you a conviction.

607
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,711
And with Judge Lyttle,

608
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:54,631
I've got a very good shot
at a required finding of not guilty.

609
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:57,134
That is a political death knell.

610
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:00,137
I'm offering you an escape hatch.

611
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,391
[grunts]

612
00:37:04,975 --> 00:37:07,436
- What's this?
- Just have a read. Just check it out.

613
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:14,985
[papers rustling]

614
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:20,657
Why am I just seeing this now?

615
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:23,702
We just got it ourselves.

616
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:38,050
[Rusty chuckling]

617
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:40,093
[Barbara chuckles]

618
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:43,764
That wasn't the kind of sex we have.

619
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,600
Well, not for a long time, anyway.

620
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,189
Was it the kind of sex you had with her?

621
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:57,486
No.

622
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:01,865
She isn't you.

623
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:05,077
She wasn't.

624
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,500
I think what I find hard to understand is...

625
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,380
did you ask yourself...

626
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:20,551
what you were willing to lose?

627
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:29,643
[Rusty] We were so far apart, you and me.

628
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:33,230
I feel like, at the time,
we couldn't even have a conversation.

629
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:37,693
But she woke something up inside me,
you know?

630
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:38,777
Something...

631
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:41,822
that I thought was dead.

632
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:49,621
When you said I needed
to take responsibility--

633
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:51,790
Oh, B... [stammers]
...I don't think I meant it the way you--

634
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,418
[Barbara] I don't think you were wrong,
Rusty.

635
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:57,671
I think we allowed ourselves...

636
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:02,843
to drift apart.

637
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:10,517
Even the sex we just had now, it felt like
we were trying to prove something.

638
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:15,606
That what we had is still there.

639
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:19,985
Is it?

640
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:23,405
[phone buzzing]

641
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,577
Fucking Raymond.

642
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:29,953
[Barbara sighs]

643
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:32,831
I'm gonna take it. [sighs]

644
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:36,376
Hey.

645
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:37,794
[door closes]

646
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:39,463
- [Raymond] <i>Rusty.</i>
- Yeah.

647
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:43,300
[sighs] Our case just took a turn.

648
00:39:44,593 --> 00:39:46,094
[sighs]

649
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:49,348
Your skin was found
under Carolyn's fingernails.

650
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,017
What? That's-- Wait. That's impossible.

651
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,394
It's in the report.
I just learned about it.

652
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:57,606
No. It's-- I--
Ray, she never scratched me.

653
00:39:57,606 --> 00:39:59,900
Like-- [stammers] It's--
It's-- It's a fucking lie.

654
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,860
DNA is DNA, Rusty.

655
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,321
No, it's a lie. I-- [stammers] Oh, my God.

656
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:07,741
[breathes shakily] I can't believe
that they're going ahead and doing this.

657
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:09,034
Who?

658
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:12,496
Fucking Molto and-- and-- and Delay,
and-- and Kumagai, all of them.

659
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:13,789
- Oh, come on.
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

660
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:15,457
I-- [stammers] She never scratched me.

661
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:18,335
It's-- It's-- It's fucking planted.
They don't have a case.

662
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:21,588
They have no case,
so they're fucking trying to frame me.

663
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,006
- [Jaden] Dad! Dad!
- [banging]

664
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:24,842
[man] Come on! Open it up!
I know you're in there!

665
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:26,802
- Fuck. What?
- <i>There's gotta be a reason for this.</i>

666
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:27,886
- [Jaden] Dad!
- No, I--

667
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:29,930
- What is it? What's going on?
- There's someone at the door!

668
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,015
- Raymond, hold on. What's wrong?
- [man shouts indistinctly]

669
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:33,851
- I don't know.
- [Rusty] Hey, calm down.

670
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:35,477
- I was just watching TV and--
- Okay.

671
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:36,895
Honey, honey, calm down. It's okay.

672
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:39,356
- Hey! Hey! Stop banging at my door!
- [shouting continues]

673
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:41,149
- Who is it? [stammers]
- I don't know!

674
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:42,484
[Barbara] Rusty. Jaden!

675
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:44,570
- [man] You come and fuck with my family!
- Dad, who is that?

676
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,321
- Hold on! Just stop!
- [Barbara] I'm gonna call the cops.

677
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:48,657
No! Do not call the police, Barbara.
Just let me think.

678
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:49,783
[man] Open this door up.

679
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,660
- Jaden, step away from the door!
- [Barbara] Step away!

680
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,203
- [man] Open the fucking door!
- Just ho--

681
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:54,830
- <i>Rusty.</i>
- Mr. Ratzer! Listen to me.

682
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,874
- You come and fuck with my family...
- I'm the one you want.

683
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:59,126
- Step away from my house.
- ...I'll fuck with your family!

684
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:01,420
- [echoing] Honey, come here. Honey.
- [echoing] Mr. Ratzer!

685
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,214
- Listen to me...
- <i>Rusty. Hello? Hello?</i>

686
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:05,424
[clamoring]

687
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:07,885
- One more time! I swear to God!
- [screams, grunts]

688
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:10,596
- [Barbara] Rusty!
- Dad! Dad! Dad!

689
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:12,014
- Rusty, Stop!
- Enough! Look at me!

690
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:15,100
- Please! Dad. [echoes]
- [Barbara] Rusty!

691
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,185
[cries]

692
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,189
[sighs]
