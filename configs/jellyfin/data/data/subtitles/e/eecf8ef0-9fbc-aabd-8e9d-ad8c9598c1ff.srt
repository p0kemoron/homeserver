00:16:05,304 --> 00:16:06,764
I'm gonna die.

177
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:17,608
Shit!

178
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:39,004
Oh, shit!

179
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:45,761
I can't do this.

180
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,441
Shit.

181
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:53,537
As you can see, we've had our eye on
you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

182
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,499
It seems that you've been living...

183
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,877
...two lives.

184
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:03,797
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

185
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:07,384
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

186
00:18:08,427 --> 00:18:11,722
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

187
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:13,432
And you...

188
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:18,645
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

189
00:18:21,148 --> 00:18:24,276
The other life is lived in computers...

190
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:27,529
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

191
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,576
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

192
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:35,829
One of these lives...

193
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,915
...has a future.

194
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:40,250
And one of them does not.

195
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:47,800
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

196
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:50,135
You're here...

197
00:18:50,469 --> 00:18:52,721
...because we need your help.

198
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,353
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

199
00:18:59,603 --> 00:19:01,396
...individual.

200
00:19:02,314 --> 00:19:06,360
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

201
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:11,365
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

202
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:14,034
He is considered by many authorities...

203
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:17,329
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

204
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,250
My colleagues...

205
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:24,628
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

206
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,340
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

207
00:19:28,632 --> 00:19:32,135
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

208
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:34,638
...give you a fresh start.

209
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:38,058
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

210
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:41,812
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

211
00:19:43,188 --> 00:19:44,439
Yeah.

212
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:47,818
That sounds like a really good deal.

213
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:51,196
But I got a better one.

214
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:52,948
How about...

215
00:19:53,365 --> 00:19:55,367
...I give you the finger...

216
00:19:57,953 --> 00:19:59,955
...and you give me my phone call.

217
00:20:02,165 --> 00:20:04,001
Mr. Anderson...

218
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:09,214
...you disappoint me.

219
00:20:09,464 --> 00:20:12,092
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.

220
00:20:12,342 --> 00:20:13,719
I know my rights.

221
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:15,470
I want my phone call.

222
00:20:16,054 --> 00:20:18,223
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

223
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:20,517
...what good is a phone call...

224
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:24,354
...if you're unable to speak?

225
00:20:58,138 --> 00:21:00,349
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

226
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:03,018
...whether you want to or not.

227
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,732
[PHONE RINGS]

228
00:22:01,451 --> 00:22:04,705
MORPHEUS: <i>This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.</i>

229
00:22:04,955 --> 00:22:09,251
<i>They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.</i>

230
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:11,336
<i>If they knew what I know...</i>

231
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:13,588
<i>...you would probably be dead.</i>

232
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:18,301
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

233
00:22:18,552 --> 00:22:23,390
<i>You are the One, Neo. You may have
spent the last few years...</i>

234
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,601
<i>...looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life...</i>

235
00:22:26,852 --> 00:22:28,353
<i>...looking for you.</i>

236
00:22:29,896 --> 00:22:32,065
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

237
00:22:33,025 --> 00:22:35,902
- Yes.
<i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>

238
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:47,330
Get in.

239
00:22:59,384 --> 00:23:00,427
What's this?

240
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:03,221
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

241
00:23:03,472 --> 00:23:05,640
- From what?
- From you.

242
00:23:07,184 --> 00:23:08,643
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

243
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,978
Stop the car.

244
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:15,734
Listen, coppertop.

245
00:23:15,984 --> 00:23:17,986
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

246
00:23:18,487 --> 00:23:20,864
Right now, there's only one rule:

247
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:22,491
Our way...

248
00:23:22,824 --> 00:23:23,909
...or the highway.

249
00:23:30,457 --> 00:23:31,541
Fine.

250
00:23:33,418 --> 00:23:35,879
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

251
00:23:36,463 --> 00:23:39,091
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

252
00:23:39,841 --> 00:23:41,051
You know that road.

253
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:43,678
You know exactly where it ends.

254
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:48,141
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

255
00:24:02,322 --> 00:24:03,865
Apoc, lights.

256
00:24:06,368 --> 00:24:08,537
TRINITY: Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

257
00:24:10,455 --> 00:24:12,707
- What's that?
- You're bugged.

258
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:21,925
Try and relax.

259
00:24:28,223 --> 00:24:29,391
Come on.

260
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:31,476
Come on.

261
00:24:33,228 --> 00:24:34,229
It's on the move.

262
00:24:36,022 --> 00:24:37,232
Come on, you shit.

263
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:41,319
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

264
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:42,571
Clear!

265
00:24:51,163 --> 00:24:53,290
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?

266
00:25:27,032 --> 00:25:28,366
This is it.

267
00:25:31,703 --> 00:25:34,164
Let me give you one piece of advice.

268
00:25:35,123 --> 00:25:36,791
Be honest.

269
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:40,587
He knows more than you can imagine.

270
00:25:49,304 --> 00:25:50,639
At last.

271
00:25:52,182 --> 00:25:53,266
Welcome, Neo.

272
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:56,394
As you no doubt have guessed...

273
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:57,896
...I am Morpheus.

274
00:25:58,939 --> 00:26:00,523
It's an honor to meet you.

275
00:26:00,982 --> 00:26:02,025
No...

276
00:26:02,609 --> 00:26:03,902
...the honor is mine.

277
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:07,322
Please, come. Sit.

278
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,047
I imagine...

279
00:26:24,464 --> 00:26:27,217
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

280
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:31,346
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

281
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,265
You could say that.

282
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:36,810
I can see it in your eyes.

283
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:40,689
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

284
00:26:40,939 --> 00:26:43,191
...because he's expecting to wake up.

285
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:47,195
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

286
00:26:47,904 --> 00:26:50,282
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

287
00:26:50,448 --> 00:26:51,533
No.

288
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,993
Why not?

289
00:26:53,243 --> 00:26:56,037
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

290
00:26:57,122 --> 00:27:00,458
I know exactly what you mean.

291
00:27:04,754 --> 00:27:07,132
Let me tell you why you're here.

292
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:09,718
You know something.

293
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,886
What you know,
you can't explain.

294
00:27:12,387 --> 00:27:13,972
But you feel it.

295
00:27:14,556 --> 00:27:16,474
You felt it your entire life:

296
00:27:17,058 --> 00:27:21,229
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

297
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,940
Like a splinter in your mind...

298
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,067
...driving you mad.

299
00:27:26,985 --> 00:27:29,738
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

300
00:27:32,282 --> 00:27:34,117
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

301
00:27:35,952 --> 00:27:37,287
The Matrix?

302
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:41,458
Do you want to know...

303
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:43,918
...what it is?

304
00:27:46,296 --> 00:27:48,173
The Matrix is everywhere.

305
00:27:48,423 --> 00:27:50,133
It is all around us.

306
00:27:50,383 --> 00:27:52,344
Even now, in this very room.

307
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:55,388
You can see it when you
look out your window...

308
00:27:55,638 --> 00:27:57,974
...or when you turn on your television.

309
00:27:58,391 --> 00:28:00,935
You can feel it when you go to work...

310
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:04,147
...when you go to church...

311
00:28:04,564 --> 00:28:06,649
...when you pay your taxes.

312
00:28:07,776 --> 00:28:10,695
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

313
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:12,530
...to blind you from the truth.

314
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:15,992
What truth?

315
00:28:20,246 --> 00:28:21,790
That you are a slave.

316
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:25,585
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

317
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:30,507
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

318
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,092
A prison...

319
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:33,468
...for your mind.

320
00:28:40,475 --> 00:28:42,811
Unfortunately, no one can be...

321
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:45,522
...told what the Matrix is.

322
00:28:48,983 --> 00:28:50,860
You have to see it for yourself.

323
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,664
This is your last chance.

324
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:05,250
After this, there is no turning back.

325
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,168
You take the blue pill...

326
00:29:07,502 --> 00:29:10,547
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

327
00:29:10,797 --> 00:29:12,590
...whatever you want to believe.

328
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:14,175
You take the red pill...

329
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:16,386
...you stay in Wonderland...

330
00:29:16,886 --> 00:29:19,597
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

331
00:29:29,482 --> 00:29:30,692
Remember...

332
00:29:31,526 --> 00:29:34,571
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

333
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:50,211
Follow me.

334
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:54,424
Apoc, are we on-line?

335
00:29:54,674 --> 00:29:56,050
APOC:
Almost.

336
00:29:59,387 --> 00:30:01,431
MORPHEUS:
Time is always against us.

337
00:30:01,806 --> 00:30:03,308
Please take a seat there.

338
00:30:21,493 --> 00:30:23,203
- You did all this?
TRINITY: Mm-hm.

339
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:29,334
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

340
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:34,714
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

341
00:30:35,256 --> 00:30:36,299
What does that mean?

342
00:30:36,883 --> 00:30:39,052
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

343
00:30:39,385 --> 00:30:40,720
...because Kansas...

344
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,013
...is going bye-bye.

345
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:21,302
Did you...?

346
00:31:32,313 --> 00:31:36,401
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

347
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,446
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

348
00:31:40,697 --> 00:31:43,199
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

349
00:31:43,825 --> 00:31:45,243
...and the real world?

350
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:48,037
NEO:
This can't be.

351
00:31:48,204 --> 00:31:49,247
MORPHEUS:
Be what?

352
00:31:49,956 --> 00:31:51,457
Be real?

353
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,838
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

354
00:31:57,046 --> 00:31:58,047
Still nothing.

355
00:31:58,631 --> 00:31:59,841
NEO:
It's cold.

356
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:01,467
It's cold!

357
00:32:05,346 --> 00:32:07,015
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

358
00:32:08,516 --> 00:32:11,185
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

359
00:32:11,436 --> 00:32:12,895
APOC:
Targeting almost there.

360
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,609
He's going into arrest.

361
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:20,361
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

362
00:35:17,622 --> 00:35:18,706
Welcome...

363
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,958
...to the real world.

364
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:24,212
MORPHEUS:
We've done it, Trinity.

365
00:35:24,462 --> 00:35:26,005
We found him.

366
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:29,050
- I hope you're right.
MORPHEUS: I don't have to hope.

367
00:35:29,634 --> 00:35:31,219
I know it.

368
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,433
Am I dead?

369
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:40,102
Far from it.

370
00:35:54,075 --> 00:35:55,493
He still needs a lot of work.

371
00:35:57,036 --> 00:35:58,120
What are you doing?

372
00:35:58,371 --> 00:36:00,581
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

373
00:36:01,165 --> 00:36:02,708
Why do my eyes hurt?

374
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,294
You've never used them before.

375
00:36:09,048 --> 00:36:10,091
Rest, Neo.

376
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:12,009
The answers are coming.

377
00:37:22,663 --> 00:37:24,248
[DOOR OPENS]

378
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:28,169
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

379
00:37:28,794 --> 00:37:29,879
What is this place?

380
00:37:30,129 --> 00:37:32,798
More important than "what" is "when."

381
00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:34,342
"When"?

382
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,594
You believe it's the year 1999...

383
00:37:36,844 --> 00:37:39,096
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

384
00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:42,975
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

385
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:44,852
...because we honestly don't know.

386
00:37:45,353 --> 00:37:48,189
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

387
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:51,192
Come with me.
See for yourself.

388
00:37:51,734 --> 00:37:53,486
MORPHEUS:
This is my ship.

389
00:37:53,778 --> 00:37:56,697
The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i>
It's a hovercraft.

390
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:01,285
This is the main deck.

391
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:08,292
This is the core...

392
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:14,548
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

393
00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:21,097
Most of my crew you already know.

394
00:38:26,102 --> 00:38:27,520
This is Apoc...

395
00:38:28,312 --> 00:38:29,647
...Switch...

396
00:38:31,232 --> 00:38:32,400
- ...and Cypher.
- Hi.

397
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:36,362
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

398
00:38:37,238 --> 00:38:39,657
The little one behind you is Mouse.

399
00:38:43,995 --> 00:38:47,248
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

400
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,500
Trinity.

401
00:39:10,521 --> 00:39:12,106
Try to relax.

402
00:39:16,986 --> 00:39:18,821
This will feel a little weird.

403
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:32,168
This...

404
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:34,045
...is the Construct.

405
00:39:34,462 --> 00:39:36,589
It's our loading program.

406
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:39,300
We can load anything, from clothing...

407
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,926
...to equipment...

408
00:39:41,218 --> 00:39:42,553
...weapons...

409
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:45,014
...training simulations...

410
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:47,933
...anything we need.

411
00:39:50,728 --> 00:39:53,147
NEO: Right now we're inside
a computer program?

412
00:39:53,439 --> 00:39:55,357
Is it really so hard to believe?

413
00:39:55,858 --> 00:39:58,486
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

414
00:39:59,695 --> 00:40:01,781
Your hair has changed.

415
00:40:02,156 --> 00:40:05,493
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

416
00:40:06,202 --> 00:40:08,829
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

417
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,836
This isn't real?

418
00:40:16,087 --> 00:40:17,630
What is "real"?

419
00:40:18,005 --> 00:40:20,257
How do you define "real"?

420
00:40:20,549 --> 00:40:22,468
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

421
00:40:22,718 --> 00:40:25,137
...what you can smell, taste and see...

422
00:40:25,387 --> 00:40:29,266
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

423
00:40:33,437 --> 00:40:35,856
This is the world that you know.

424
00:40:37,274 --> 00:40:40,319
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

425
00:40:42,696 --> 00:40:47,034
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

426
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:48,536
...that we call the Matrix.

427
00:40:53,082 --> 00:40:55,876
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

428
00:40:56,877 --> 00:40:58,003
This is the world...

429
00:40:58,295 --> 00:41:00,047
...as it exists today.

430
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:16,063
Welcome to "the desert...

431
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:18,524
...of the real."

432
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:24,280
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

433
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:28,325
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21st century...

434
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:31,829
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

435
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,834
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to AI.

436
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:38,752
AI.

437
00:41:39,795 --> 00:41:41,172
You mean artificial intelligence.

438
00:41:41,422 --> 00:41:45,843
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

439
00:41:46,677 --> 00:41:50,139
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

440
00:41:50,556 --> 00:41:53,767
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

441
00:41:55,436 --> 00:41:57,605
They were dependent on solar power...

442
00:41:57,855 --> 00:42:01,192
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

443
00:42:01,525 --> 00:42:05,029
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

444
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:10,159
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

445
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:15,831
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

446
00:42:19,043 --> 00:42:23,464
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

447
00:42:23,714 --> 00:42:27,843
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

448
00:42:29,762 --> 00:42:31,931
Combined with a form of fusion...

449
00:42:32,264 --> 00:42:37,102
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

450
00:42:41,148 --> 00:42:44,902
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

451
00:42:45,152 --> 00:42:48,405
...where human beings
are no longer born.

452
00:42:49,114 --> 00:42:50,950
We are grown.

453
00:42:56,997 --> 00:42:59,583
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

454
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:02,503
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

455
00:43:03,837 --> 00:43:05,464
...watched them liquefy the dead...

456
00:43:05,714 --> 00:43:09,051
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

457
00:43:09,593 --> 00:43:13,847
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

458
00:43:14,098 --> 00:43:17,017
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

459
00:43:19,645 --> 00:43:21,438
What is the Matrix?

460
00:43:22,648 --> 00:43:23,691
Control.

461
00:43:25,067 --> 00:43:28,445
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

462
00:43:29,238 --> 00:43:32,324
...built to keep us under control...

463
00:43:33,492 --> 00:43:36,662
...in order to change a human being...

464
00:43:37,288 --> 00:43:38,455
...into this.

465
00:43:39,832 --> 00:43:40,958
No.

466
00:43:42,584 --> 00:43:44,169
I don't believe it.

467
00:43:44,545 --> 00:43:45,754
It's not possible.

468
00:43:46,338 --> 00:43:50,926
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

469
00:43:51,176 --> 00:43:52,469
Stop!

470
00:43:53,012 --> 00:43:54,221
Let me out!

471
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,849
Let me out! I want out!

472
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:01,478
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

473
00:44:01,729 --> 00:44:03,397
Get this thing out of me!

474
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,692
Don't touch me!

475
00:44:06,942 --> 00:44:08,569
Stay away from me!

476
00:44:08,986 --> 00:44:10,487
I don't believe it.

477
00:44:11,196 --> 00:44:12,406
I don't believe it.

478
00:44:12,656 --> 00:44:14,158
I don't believe it.

479
00:44:14,408 --> 00:44:16,452
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

480
00:44:16,827 --> 00:44:17,911
Just breathe.

481
00:44:36,305 --> 00:44:38,098
I can't go back, can I?

482
00:44:38,932 --> 00:44:40,351
No.

483
00:44:41,185 --> 00:44:42,394
But if you could...

484
00:44:43,228 --> 00:44:44,730
...would you really want to?

485
00:44:47,232 --> 00:44:48,609
I owe you an apology.

486
00:44:49,193 --> 00:44:50,569
We have a rule.

487
00:44:51,028 --> 00:44:54,281
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

488
00:44:54,448 --> 00:44:55,532
It's dangerous.

489
00:44:56,241 --> 00:44:57,951
The mind has trouble letting go.

490
00:44:58,202 --> 00:45:00,496
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

491
00:45:01,538 --> 00:45:03,624
I did what I did because...

492
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:05,793
...I had to.

493
00:45:14,218 --> 00:45:18,305
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

494
00:45:18,806 --> 00:45:22,601
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

495
00:45:22,976 --> 00:45:25,896
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

496
00:45:27,648 --> 00:45:31,110
It was he who freed the first of us...

497
00:45:31,985 --> 00:45:33,612
...taught us the truth.

498
00:45:35,072 --> 00:45:38,158
As long as the Matrix exists...

499
00:45:38,492 --> 00:45:40,577
...the human race will never be free.

500
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,333
After he died...

501
00:45:47,084 --> 00:45:49,795
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

502
00:45:50,337 --> 00:45:53,549
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

503
00:45:53,799 --> 00:45:55,467
...end the war...

504
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:57,052
...bring freedom to our people.

505
00:45:58,387 --> 00:46:03,016
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

506
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:04,935
...looking for him.

507
00:46:07,354 --> 00:46:09,440
I did what I did because...

508
00:46:11,066 --> 00:46:13,193
...I believe that search is over.

509
00:46:18,282 --> 00:46:19,700
Get some rest.

510
00:46:20,325 --> 00:46:22,119
You're going to need it.

511
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:25,873
For what?

512
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:30,127
Your training.

513
00:46:48,437 --> 00:46:50,147
Morning. Did you sleep?

514
00:46:51,023 --> 00:46:52,232
You will tonight.

515
00:46:52,608 --> 00:46:54,151
I guarantee it.

516
00:46:55,652 --> 00:46:57,571
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

517
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:00,449
- You don't have any--
- Holes? Nope.

518
00:47:01,366 --> 00:47:06,079
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

519
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,539
Born free right here...

520
00:47:08,081 --> 00:47:09,416
...in the real world.

521
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:11,335
Genuine child of Zion.

522
00:47:12,169 --> 00:47:14,630
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

523
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,381
...Zion's where the party would be.

524
00:47:16,798 --> 00:47:18,091
It's a city?

525
00:47:18,342 --> 00:47:21,512
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

526
00:47:23,096 --> 00:47:24,348
Where is it?

527
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:29,520
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

528
00:47:31,146 --> 00:47:33,023
You live long enough,
you might see it.

529
00:47:35,275 --> 00:47:40,113
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

530
00:47:40,364 --> 00:47:42,115
...if Morpheus is right and all.

531
00:47:42,616 --> 00:47:45,369
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

532
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:47,037
...if you are...

533
00:47:48,121 --> 00:47:50,123
...it's a very exciting time.

534
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:53,877
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

535
00:47:57,798 --> 00:48:00,717
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

536
00:48:01,718 --> 00:48:05,180
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

537
00:48:05,514 --> 00:48:06,974
How about...

538
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,310
...combat training?

539
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:17,818
"Jujitsu"?

540
00:48:18,694 --> 00:48:20,362
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

541
00:48:31,707 --> 00:48:32,916
Holy shit!

542
00:48:33,166 --> 00:48:35,502
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

543
00:48:35,836 --> 00:48:37,129
How about some more?

544
00:48:37,379 --> 00:48:38,672
Hell, yes.

545
00:48:40,757 --> 00:48:41,800
Hell, yeah.

546
00:48:53,979 --> 00:48:55,063
How is he?

547
00:48:55,314 --> 00:48:57,482
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

548
00:49:08,702 --> 00:49:10,078
I know kung fu.

549
00:49:11,747 --> 00:49:12,748
Show me.

550
00:49:14,541 --> 00:49:16,293
This is a sparring program...

551
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,338
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

552
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:21,923
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

553
00:49:22,174 --> 00:49:25,636
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

554
00:49:26,178 --> 00:49:27,679
Some of them can be bent.

555
00:49:27,888 --> 00:49:30,349
Others can be broken.

556
00:49:30,891 --> 00:49:31,975
Understand?

557
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,102
Then hit me...

558
00:49:34,686 --> 00:49:35,812
...if you can.

559
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:15,852
Good!

560
00:50:16,603 --> 00:50:17,771
Adaptation.

561
00:50:18,063 --> 00:50:19,272
Improvisation.

562
00:50:19,564 --> 00:50:20,899
But your weakness...

563
00:50:21,149 --> 00:50:22,526
...is not your technique.

564
00:50:29,491 --> 00:50:31,576
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

565
00:51:43,857 --> 00:51:45,025
How did I beat you?

566
00:51:51,615 --> 00:51:52,699
You're too fast.

567
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:54,576
Do you believe that...

568
00:51:54,951 --> 00:51:57,454
...my being stronger or faster...

569
00:51:57,704 --> 00:52:01,374
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

570
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,214
You think you're breathing air?

571
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:21,937
Again!

572
00:52:33,406 --> 00:52:35,826
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

573
00:52:36,076 --> 00:52:38,286
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

574
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,210
What are you waiting for?

575
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,420
You're faster than this.

576
00:52:49,631 --> 00:52:51,842
Don't think you are.

577
00:52:52,092 --> 00:52:53,760
Know you are.

578
00:53:04,145 --> 00:53:06,940
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

579
00:53:16,867 --> 00:53:18,618
I don't believe it.

580
00:53:20,161 --> 00:53:22,289
I know what you're trying to do.

581
00:53:23,957 --> 00:53:26,126
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

582
00:53:26,459 --> 00:53:28,545
But I can only show you the door.

583
00:53:29,129 --> 00:53:30,964
You have to walk through it.

584
00:53:33,341 --> 00:53:35,468
Tank, load the jump program.

585
00:53:47,063 --> 00:53:49,774
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

586
00:53:50,317 --> 00:53:52,485
...doubt and disbelief.

587
00:53:53,653 --> 00:53:56,364
Free your mind.

588
00:54:04,623 --> 00:54:05,749
Whoa.

589
00:54:12,547 --> 00:54:14,257
Okey-dokey.

590
00:54:16,343 --> 00:54:17,510
Free my mind.

591
00:54:17,969 --> 00:54:19,095
What if he makes it?

592
00:54:19,346 --> 00:54:22,057
- No one's ever made their first jump.
MOUSE: I know.

593
00:54:23,391 --> 00:54:25,852
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

594
00:54:26,436 --> 00:54:27,520
Come on.

595
00:54:27,771 --> 00:54:28,939
All right.

596
00:54:29,397 --> 00:54:31,441
No problem. Free my mind.

597
00:54:32,233 --> 00:54:35,028
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

598
00:54:54,422 --> 00:54:56,091
What does that mean?

599
00:54:56,466 --> 00:54:58,301
It doesn't mean anything.

600
00:54:58,885 --> 00:55:01,471
Everybody falls the first time.

601
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:03,223
Right, Trin?

602
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:26,538
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

603
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,043
If you're killed in the Matrix...

604
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,253
...you die here?

605
00:55:33,878 --> 00:55:36,339
The body cannot live without the mind.

606
00:56:06,828 --> 00:56:10,206
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

607
00:56:13,293 --> 00:56:16,129
There is something about him,
isn't there?

608
00:56:16,755 --> 00:56:18,381
You're a believer now?

609
00:56:19,382 --> 00:56:20,592
I keep wondering...

610
00:56:20,842 --> 00:56:24,512
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

611
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:28,349
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

612
00:56:38,151 --> 00:56:39,694
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

613
00:56:41,446 --> 00:56:42,739
That system is our enemy.

614
00:56:43,364 --> 00:56:45,700
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

615
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:49,746
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

616
00:56:50,205 --> 00:56:52,791
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

617
00:56:53,041 --> 00:56:56,002
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

618
00:56:56,252 --> 00:56:58,171
...and that makes them our enemy.

619
00:56:58,338 --> 00:56:59,547
You have to understand...

620
00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:03,134
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

621
00:57:03,384 --> 00:57:04,969
And many of them are so inert...

622
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,639
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

623
00:57:07,889 --> 00:57:10,600
...that they will fight to protect it.

624
00:57:12,102 --> 00:57:15,855
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

625
00:57:16,022 --> 00:57:17,774
- I was--
- Look again.

626
00:57:19,025 --> 00:57:20,110
Freeze it.

627
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:28,368
NEO: This isn't the Matrix?
MORPHEUS: No.

628
00:57:30,161 --> 00:57:33,998
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

629
00:57:34,624 --> 00:57:37,043
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

630
00:57:37,585 --> 00:57:40,380
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

631
00:57:41,131 --> 00:57:45,426
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

632
00:57:45,802 --> 00:57:49,180
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

633
00:57:49,514 --> 00:57:50,849
...is potentially an agent.

634
00:57:51,808 --> 00:57:53,643
Inside the Matrix...

635
00:57:54,227 --> 00:57:55,937
...they are everyone...

636
00:57:56,271 --> 00:57:57,981
...and they are no one.

637
00:57:58,231 --> 00:58:01,359
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

638
00:58:01,609 --> 00:58:03,236
...but they are the gatekeepers.

639
00:58:03,486 --> 00:58:06,447
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

640
00:58:06,698 --> 00:58:09,534
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

641
00:58:09,701 --> 00:58:10,910
Someone?

642
00:58:11,244 --> 00:58:12,662
MORPHEUS:
I won't lie to you, Neo.

643
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:17,959
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent, has died.

644
00:58:18,209 --> 00:58:20,587
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

645
00:58:20,753 --> 00:58:21,838
Why?

646
00:58:22,088 --> 00:58:24,382
MORPHEUS: I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

647
00:58:24,632 --> 00:58:28,219
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

648
00:58:28,469 --> 00:58:33,099
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

649
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:34,475
Because of that...

650
00:58:34,726 --> 00:58:38,104
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

651
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,277
What are you telling me?

652
00:58:44,986 --> 00:58:46,446
That I can dodge bullets?

653
00:58:48,448 --> 00:58:49,824
No, Neo.

654
00:58:50,325 --> 00:58:53,244
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

655
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,455
...you won't have to.

656
00:58:56,789 --> 00:58:58,291
[PHONE RINGS]

657
00:58:59,584 --> 00:59:00,793

658

- Did Zion send the warning?
- No, another ship.

659
00:59:25,443 --> 00:59:26,736
Shit.

00:59:26,986 --> 00:59:29,864
- Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
- Squiddy?

661
00:59:30,073 --> 00:59:33,284
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

662
00:59:33,534 --> 00:59:34,744
Search and destroy.

663
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,247
Set her down there.

664
00:59:58,518 --> 01:00:00,019
How are we doing, Tank?

01:00:12,907 --> 01:00:14,450
- ...and ready.
- EMP?

668
01:00:14,742 --> 01:00:16,619
Electromagnetic pulse.

669
01:00:16,869 --> 01:00:19,747
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

670
01:00:19,914 --> 01:00:22,208
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

01:00:28,006 --> 01:00:31,134
NEO: Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

672
01:00:32,385 --> 01:00:33,511
Sewers.

673
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,431
TRINITY: There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.

674
01:00:36,931 --> 01:00:38,850
Now these sewers are
all that's left.

675
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,435
Quiet.

676
01:01:21,017 --> 01:01:22,477
Whoa! Neo.

677
01:01:24,312 --> 01:01:26,481
You scared the bejesus out of me.

678
01:01:27,565 --> 01:01:29,484
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

679
01:01:31,986 --> 01:01:33,237
Is that...?

680
01:01:33,488 --> 01:01:35,073
The Matrix?

681
01:01:35,239 --> 01:01:36,449
Yeah.

682
01:01:38,242 --> 01:01:41,412
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

683
01:01:41,662 --> 01:01:44,749
The image translators work
for the construct program.

684
01:01:44,999 --> 01:01:48,419
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

685
01:01:48,669 --> 01:01:51,631
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

01:01:58,137 --> 01:01:59,222
...want a drink?

689
01:01:59,472 --> 01:02:00,515
Sure.

690
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,520
You know...

691
01:02:06,437 --> 01:02:07,980
...I know what you're thinking.

692
01:02:08,231 --> 01:02:10,316
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.

693
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:13,986
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

694
01:02:15,905 --> 01:02:18,908

Dozer makes it.

698
01:02:35,216 --> 01:02:36,384
It's good for two things:

01:02:36,634 --> 01:02:39,720
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

700
01:02:40,721 --> 01:02:42,932
So can I ask you something?

701
01:02:45,935 --> 01:02:47,562
Did he tell you why he did it?

702
01:02:50,189 --> 01:02:52,024
Why you're here?

01:03:06,289 --> 01:03:08,374
What do you say
to something like that?

707
01:03:13,546 --> 01:03:14,922
A little piece of advice.

708
01:03:16,716 --> 01:03:18,134
You see an agent...

709
01:03:18,468 --> 01:03:20,761
...you do what we do:

710
01:03:21,095 --> 01:03:22,638
Run.

711
01:03:22,972 --> 01:03:24,724
You run your ass off.

712
01:03:31,981 --> 01:03:33,691
Thanks for the drink.

713
01:03:38,404 --> 01:03:39,572
Sweet dreams.

714
01:03:43,576 --> 01:03:46,996
SMITH:
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

715
01:03:47,663 --> 01:03:48,789
You know...

716
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:52,668
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

717
01:03:53,669 --> 01:03:56,422
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...

718
01:03:56,672 --> 01:03:59,759
...the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...

719
01:04:00,051 --> 01:04:01,177
...juicy...

720
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:03,179
...and delicious.

721
01:04:06,098 --> 01:04:07,350
After nine years...

722
01:04:08,392 --> 01:04:09,936
...you know what I realize?

723
01:04:17,777 --> 01:04:18,986
Ignorance is bliss.

724
01:04:24,033 --> 01:04:25,868
Then we have a deal.

725
01:04:28,371 --> 01:04:30,289
I don't want to remember nothing.

726
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:33,042
Nothing. You understand?

727
01:04:36,921 --> 01:04:38,923
And I want to be rich.

728
01:04:40,258 --> 01:04:42,969
You know, someone important.

729
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:45,596
Like an actor.

730
01:04:46,806 --> 01:04:49,934
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

731
01:04:52,103 --> 01:04:53,646
Okay.

732
01:04:54,021 --> 01:04:56,440
You get my body
back in a power plant...

733
01:04:56,816 --> 01:04:58,568
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

734
01:04:58,901 --> 01:05:00,319
...I'll get you what you want.

735
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:02,572
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

736
01:05:02,822 --> 01:05:04,991
No. I told you, I don't know them.

737
01:05:07,952 --> 01:05:09,954
I can get you the man who does.

738
01:05:10,705 --> 01:05:12,498
Morpheus.

739
01:05:22,592 --> 01:05:26,053
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

740
01:05:27,388 --> 01:05:30,182
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

741
01:05:30,391 --> 01:05:32,101
Or a bowl of snot.

742
01:05:32,643 --> 01:05:34,228
MOUSE:
You know what it reminds me of?

743
01:05:36,063 --> 01:05:38,399
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?

744
01:05:39,025 --> 01:05:40,735
No, but technically,
neither did you.

745
01:05:40,985 --> 01:05:43,029
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

746
01:05:43,279 --> 01:05:44,655
Because you have to wonder...

747
01:05:44,905 --> 01:05:48,159
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

748
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:49,827
Maybe they got it wrong.

749
01:05:50,077 --> 01:05:53,289
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like...

750
01:05:53,581 --> 01:05:55,583
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

751
01:05:55,958 --> 01:05:58,794
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

752
01:05:59,045 --> 01:06:01,047
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

753
01:06:01,297 --> 01:06:03,341
...which is why it tastes
like everything.

754
01:06:03,591 --> 01:06:05,384
- And maybe they--
- Shut up.

755
01:06:07,011 --> 01:06:08,471
DOZER:
It's a single-celled protein...

756
01:06:08,721 --> 01:06:11,766
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

757
01:06:12,016 --> 01:06:13,267
Everything the body needs.

758
01:06:13,517 --> 01:06:16,395
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.

759
01:06:19,148 --> 01:06:22,234
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

760
01:06:23,277 --> 01:06:25,321
You know, I wrote that program.

761
01:06:25,613 --> 01:06:26,906
Here it comes.

762
01:06:27,156 --> 01:06:29,116
MOUSE: What did you think of her?
NEO: Of who?

763
01:06:29,492 --> 01:06:32,536
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

764
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:35,623
She doesn't talk very much...

765
01:06:35,873 --> 01:06:39,835
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.

766
01:06:40,086 --> 01:06:41,462
The digital pimp hard at work.

767
01:06:41,712 --> 01:06:43,964
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

768
01:06:45,257 --> 01:06:47,093
To deny our own impulses...

769
01:06:47,343 --> 01:06:50,471
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

770
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:53,766
Dozer, when you're done...

771
01:06:53,974 --> 01:06:55,559
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

772
01:06:56,143 --> 01:06:57,478
We're going in.

773
01:06:58,187 --> 01:06:59,605
I'm taking Neo to see her.

774
01:07:03,526 --> 01:07:04,777
See who?

775
01:07:05,778 --> 01:07:07,029
The Oracle.

776
01:07:12,535 --> 01:07:14,078
Everyone please observe...

777
01:07:14,412 --> 01:07:17,123
...the "fasten seat belt"
and "no smoking" signs are on.

778
01:07:17,623 --> 01:07:21,001
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

779
01:07:21,252 --> 01:07:23,045
[PHONE RINGS]

780
01:07:45,443 --> 01:07:46,444
We're in.

781
01:08:02,084 --> 01:08:03,252
We'll be back in an hour.

782
01:08:06,756 --> 01:08:09,300
[PHONE DIALS, THEN RINGS]

783
01:08:18,017 --> 01:08:20,019
MORPHEUS:
Unbelievable...

784
01:08:20,269 --> 01:08:21,604
...isn't it?

785
01:08:25,191 --> 01:08:27,026
NEO: God!
- What?

786
01:08:27,693 --> 01:08:29,069
I used to eat there.

787
01:08:31,322 --> 01:08:32,948
Really good noodles.

788
01:08:37,745 --> 01:08:40,247
I have these memories from my life.

789
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:44,376
None of them happened.

790
01:08:45,085 --> 01:08:46,337
What does that mean?

791
01:08:46,587 --> 01:08:48,798
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

792
01:08:49,715 --> 01:08:50,925
But an oracle can?

793
01:08:51,383 --> 01:08:52,593
That's different.

794
01:08:57,306 --> 01:08:58,557
Did you go to her?

795
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,268
TRINITY:
Yes.

796
01:09:01,769 --> 01:09:03,145
What did she tell you?

797
01:09:06,398 --> 01:09:07,900
She told me....

798
01:09:08,943 --> 01:09:10,110
What?

799
01:09:13,906 --> 01:09:15,241
MORPHEUS:
We're here.

800
01:09:15,616 --> 01:09:17,910
Neo, come with me.

801
01:09:37,888 --> 01:09:40,307
So is this the same oracle
that made...

802
01:09:40,474 --> 01:09:41,725
...the prophecy?

803
01:09:41,976 --> 01:09:46,313
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

804
01:09:46,772 --> 01:09:48,774
NEO: The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

805
01:09:51,026 --> 01:09:53,404
And she knows what? Everything?

806
01:09:55,447 --> 01:09:57,366
She would say she knows enough.

807
01:09:58,492 --> 01:10:00,286
And she's never wrong.

808
01:10:02,496 --> 01:10:05,666
MORPHEUS: Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

809
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,585
She is a guide, Neo.

810
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,837
She can help you to find the path.

811
01:10:10,337 --> 01:10:11,589
She helped you?

812
01:10:12,298 --> 01:10:13,340
Yes.

813
01:10:14,091 --> 01:10:15,426
What did she tell you?

814
01:10:17,887 --> 01:10:20,097
That I would find the One.

815
01:10:33,235 --> 01:10:35,362
I told you I can only
show you the door.

816
01:10:36,071 --> 01:10:38,157
You have to walk through it.

817
01:10:41,952 --> 01:10:43,037
Hello, Neo.

818
01:10:43,287 --> 01:10:44,955
You're right on time.

819
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,675
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

820
01:11:02,348 --> 01:11:03,933
These are the other Potentials.

821
01:11:04,183 --> 01:11:05,726
You can wait here.

822
01:11:46,558 --> 01:11:49,103
BOY:
Do not try and bend the spoon.

823
01:11:49,478 --> 01:11:51,605
That's impossible.

824
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:56,443
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

825
01:11:56,986 --> 01:11:58,362
What truth?

826
01:11:58,612 --> 01:12:00,280
There is no spoon.

827
01:12:02,866 --> 01:12:04,201
There is no spoon?

828
01:12:04,451 --> 01:12:08,914
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

829
01:12:24,972 --> 01:12:26,432
The Oracle will you see now.

830
01:12:37,151 --> 01:12:38,694
ORACLE:
I know you're Neo.

831
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:40,487
Be right with you.

832
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:43,907
- You're the Oracle?
- Bingo.

833
01:12:46,618 --> 01:12:49,496
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?

834
01:12:50,539 --> 01:12:52,708
Almost done.

835
01:12:55,210 --> 01:12:56,837
Smell good, don't they?

836
01:12:58,088 --> 01:12:59,339
Yeah.

837
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:01,425
ORACLE:
I'd ask you to sit down...

838
01:13:01,675 --> 01:13:04,053
...but you're not going to anyway.

839
01:13:04,553 --> 01:13:07,431
- And don't worry about the vase.
- What vase?

840
01:13:10,559 --> 01:13:11,727
That vase.

841
01:13:12,686 --> 01:13:13,729
I'm sorry.

842
01:13:13,979 --> 01:13:15,856
I said, don't worry about it.

843
01:13:17,024 --> 01:13:18,984
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

844
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:20,819
How did you know?

845
01:13:22,863 --> 01:13:26,658
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

846
01:13:26,992 --> 01:13:29,953
...would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

847
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:36,668
You're cuter than I thought.

848
01:13:39,713 --> 01:13:41,965
I can see why she likes you.

849
01:13:42,841 --> 01:13:43,926
Who?

850
01:13:44,176 --> 01:13:46,011
Not too bright, though.

851
01:13:49,306 --> 01:13:52,392
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

852
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,687
So...

853
01:13:56,647 --> 01:13:58,023
...what do you think?

854
01:13:59,858 --> 01:14:01,610
Do you think you are the One?

855
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:04,613
I don't know.

856
01:14:08,033 --> 01:14:09,451
You know what that means?

857
01:14:10,285 --> 01:14:11,453
It's Latin.

858
01:14:11,829 --> 01:14:14,039
Means, "Know thyself."

859
01:14:15,499 --> 01:14:17,459
I'll let you in on a little secret.

860
01:14:19,711 --> 01:14:23,549
Being the One is just
like being in love.

861
01:14:24,258 --> 01:14:27,136
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

862
01:14:27,386 --> 01:14:28,512
...through and through.

863
01:14:28,846 --> 01:14:30,889
Balls to bones.

864
01:14:33,225 --> 01:14:34,268
Well...

865
01:14:36,228 --> 01:14:38,313
...I'd better have a look at you.

866
01:14:39,648 --> 01:14:41,150
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

867
01:14:55,539 --> 01:14:57,207
Okay....

868
01:14:57,833 --> 01:15:02,796
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but...."

869
01:15:03,297 --> 01:15:04,423
Then you say:

870
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:06,300
But what?

871
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:10,512
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

872
01:15:11,930 --> 01:15:14,892
- I'm not the One.
- Sorry, kid.

873
01:15:16,518 --> 01:15:18,520
You got the gift...

874
01:15:19,438 --> 01:15:21,732
...but it looks like
you're waiting for something.

875
01:15:26,403 --> 01:15:27,446
What?

876
01:15:27,696 --> 01:15:30,574
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

877
01:15:31,158 --> 01:15:33,410
That's the way these things go.

878
01:15:34,286 --> 01:15:36,872
- What's funny?
- Morpheus.

879
01:15:40,334 --> 01:15:42,044
He almost had me convinced.

880
01:15:42,294 --> 01:15:43,420
I know.

881
01:15:44,963 --> 01:15:47,090
Poor Morpheus.

882
01:15:49,468 --> 01:15:52,596
Without him, we're lost.

883
01:15:54,139 --> 01:15:56,308
What do you mean, "without him"?

884
01:16:00,312 --> 01:16:02,231
Are you sure you want
to hear this?

885
01:16:04,441 --> 01:16:07,194
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

886
01:16:08,904 --> 01:16:11,073

01:30:37,188 --> 01:30:38,731
- Yes.
<i>- No!</i>

1064
01:30:38,898 --> 01:30:40,066
I don't believe it.

1065
01:30:41,484 --> 01:30:46,239
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!

1066
01:30:53,412 --> 01:30:54,664
[PHONE RINGS]

1067
01:31:04,507 --> 01:31:05,883
You first.

1068
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,394
- You're hurt.
- I'll be all right.

1069
01:31:19,188 --> 01:31:20,356
Dozer?

1070
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:41,002
SMITH:
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1071
01:31:41,878 --> 01:31:45,006
Marveled at its beauty...

1072
01:31:45,381 --> 01:31:47,633
...its genius?

1073
01:31:48,801 --> 01:31:50,678
Billions of people...

1074
01:31:50,928 --> 01:31:53,681
...just living out their lives.

1075
01:31:54,724 --> 01:31:56,392
Oblivious.

1076
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:03,858
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1077
01:32:04,108 --> 01:32:08,779
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1078
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:12,200
...where everyone would be happy.

1079
01:32:12,742 --> 01:32:14,243
It was a disaster.

1080
01:32:14,493 --> 01:32:18,831
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1081
01:32:19,707 --> 01:32:21,459
Some believe that...

1082
01:32:21,709 --> 01:32:26,088
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1083
01:32:26,339 --> 01:32:27,882
But I believe that...

1084
01:32:28,049 --> 01:32:29,217
...as a species...

1085
01:32:29,467 --> 01:32:33,304
...human beings define
their reality through misery...

1086
01:32:33,554 --> 01:32:34,931
...and suffering.

1087
01:32:35,181 --> 01:32:37,892
So the perfect world was a dream...

1088
01:32:38,142 --> 01:32:42,980
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1089
01:32:44,315 --> 01:32:47,985
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

1090
01:32:48,444 --> 01:32:49,946
The peak...

1091
01:32:50,196 --> 01:32:51,614
...of your civilization.

1092
01:32:51,864 --> 01:32:54,116
I say, "your civilization"...

1093
01:32:54,367 --> 01:32:58,496
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

1094
01:32:58,746 --> 01:33:01,832
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1095
01:33:03,167 --> 01:33:05,753
Evolution, Morpheus.

1096
01:33:06,045 --> 01:33:07,380
Evolution.

1097
01:33:09,674 --> 01:33:11,550
Like the dinosaur.

1098
01:33:13,719 --> 01:33:15,346
Look out that window.

1099
01:33:16,055 --> 01:33:18,182
You had your time.

1100
01:33:18,891 --> 01:33:22,812
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1101
01:33:23,145 --> 01:33:25,523
The future is our time.

1102
01:33:29,777 --> 01:33:30,945
There could be a problem.

1103
01:33:31,862 --> 01:33:35,241
NEO: What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1104
01:33:35,491 --> 01:33:37,660
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1105
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:39,120
How much time?

1106
01:33:39,370 --> 01:33:42,498
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1107
01:33:42,748 --> 01:33:47,169
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1108
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:50,381
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

1109
01:33:50,631 --> 01:33:51,674
What do they want?

1110
01:33:51,924 --> 01:33:55,970
The leader of every ship is given
codes to Zion's mainframe computer.

1111
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:59,140
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...

1112
01:33:59,390 --> 01:34:02,476
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1113
01:34:02,643 --> 01:34:04,895
Trinity, Zion's more important than me...

1114
01:34:05,062 --> 01:34:06,230
...or you...

1115
01:34:06,397 --> 01:34:07,690
...or even Morpheus.

1116
01:34:11,485 --> 01:34:13,154
There has to be
something we can do.

1117
01:34:13,571 --> 01:34:15,573
There is. We pull the plug.

1118
01:34:18,659 --> 01:34:20,411
You're going to kill him?

1119
01:34:20,661 --> 01:34:21,829
Kill Morpheus?

1120
01:34:22,455 --> 01:34:24,081
We don't have a choice.

1121
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,799
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

1122
01:34:34,050 --> 01:34:35,801
If the insider has failed...

1123
01:34:36,052 --> 01:34:39,263
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless--

1124
01:34:39,513 --> 01:34:41,223
They're dead. In either case--

1125
01:34:41,474 --> 01:34:45,019
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1126
01:34:45,269 --> 01:34:46,354
Immediately.

1127
01:34:51,609 --> 01:34:54,278
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1128
01:34:55,237 --> 01:34:57,448
You were a father.

1129
01:34:58,991 --> 01:35:00,951
We'll miss you always.

1130
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:09,043
Stop!

1131
01:35:10,211 --> 01:35:11,545
I don't believe this is happening.

1132
01:35:11,712 --> 01:35:13,756
- Neo, this has to be done.
NEO: Does it?

1133
01:35:14,548 --> 01:35:15,925
I don't know.

1134
01:35:16,258 --> 01:35:18,719
- This can't be just coincidence.
- What?

1135
01:35:18,928 --> 01:35:20,179
NEO:
The Oracle.

1136
01:35:20,429 --> 01:35:22,223
She told me this would happen.

1137
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:26,811
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1138
01:35:27,269 --> 01:35:28,479
What choice?

1139
01:35:31,482 --> 01:35:33,984
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1140
01:35:34,318 --> 01:35:36,654
TRINITY: No, you're not.
- I have to.

1141
01:35:36,862 --> 01:35:40,491
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1142
01:35:40,741 --> 01:35:42,660
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1143
01:35:43,244 --> 01:35:46,497
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1144
01:35:47,998 --> 01:35:49,041
What?

1145
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:51,377
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1146
01:35:51,752 --> 01:35:54,713
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1147
01:35:54,964 --> 01:35:57,633
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1148
01:35:58,300 --> 01:35:59,552
No, Neo, that's not true.

1149
01:36:00,136 --> 01:36:02,763
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1150
01:36:07,184 --> 01:36:10,521
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1151
01:36:10,771 --> 01:36:15,151
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1152
01:36:16,444 --> 01:36:20,364
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1153
01:36:20,614 --> 01:36:22,199
That's what it looks like...

1154
01:36:22,366 --> 01:36:23,409
...but it's not.

1155
01:36:23,659 --> 01:36:26,036
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1156
01:36:27,121 --> 01:36:30,833
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1157
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:34,086
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1158
01:36:34,378 --> 01:36:36,881
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1159
01:36:37,047 --> 01:36:38,674
What?

1160
01:36:39,383 --> 01:36:41,093
I believe I can bring him back.

1161
01:36:58,068 --> 01:36:59,987
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1162
01:37:00,279 --> 01:37:02,281
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

1163
01:37:03,449 --> 01:37:05,576
Let me tell you what I believe.

1164
01:37:06,076 --> 01:37:08,454
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1165
01:37:08,787 --> 01:37:13,083
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1166
01:37:13,334 --> 01:37:15,377
And since I am the ranking officer...

1167
01:37:15,628 --> 01:37:18,506
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1168
01:37:19,256 --> 01:37:21,675
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1169
01:37:22,092 --> 01:37:23,636
Tank...

1170
01:37:23,802 --> 01:37:24,929
...load us up.

1171
01:37:34,563 --> 01:37:37,858
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1172
01:37:38,275 --> 01:37:39,818
...during my time here.

1173
01:37:40,069 --> 01:37:44,073
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1174
01:37:44,323 --> 01:37:46,575
...and I realized...

1175
01:37:46,825 --> 01:37:49,119
...that you're not actually mammals.

1176
01:37:51,330 --> 01:37:53,791
Every mammal on this planet...

1177
01:37:54,124 --> 01:37:59,046
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1178
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:01,131
But you humans do not.

1179
01:38:01,674 --> 01:38:05,219
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1180
01:38:05,469 --> 01:38:09,974
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1181
01:38:10,307 --> 01:38:12,393
The only way you can survive...

1182
01:38:12,685 --> 01:38:15,646
...is to spread to another area.

1183
01:38:21,068 --> 01:38:23,946
There is another organism
on this planet...

1184
01:38:24,196 --> 01:38:26,156
...that follows the same pattern.

1185
01:38:26,782 --> 01:38:28,450
Do you know what it is?

1186
01:38:28,826 --> 01:38:30,661
A virus.

1187
01:38:31,996 --> 01:38:35,040
Human beings are a disease.

1188
01:38:35,416 --> 01:38:36,959
A cancer of this planet.

1189
01:38:37,209 --> 01:38:39,336
You are a plague.

1190
01:38:39,878 --> 01:38:41,297
And we...

1191
01:38:41,463 --> 01:38:42,840
...are the cure.

1192
01:38:43,841 --> 01:38:45,259
Okay, so what do you need?

1193
01:38:45,884 --> 01:38:47,011
Besides a miracle.

1194
01:38:47,595 --> 01:38:48,804
Guns.

1195
01:38:49,638 --> 01:38:50,848
Lots of guns.

1196
01:39:00,733 --> 01:39:01,942
Neo....

1197
01:39:03,694 --> 01:39:06,238
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1198
01:39:07,448 --> 01:39:09,366
That's why it's going to work.

1199
01:39:13,454 --> 01:39:15,372
Why isn't the serum working?

1200
01:39:15,998 --> 01:39:18,292
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1201
01:39:20,377 --> 01:39:21,629
Leave me with him.

1202
01:39:24,214 --> 01:39:25,341
Now.

1203
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,145
TANK:
Hold on, Morpheus.

1204
01:39:38,395 --> 01:39:41,106
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1205
01:39:43,484 --> 01:39:45,611
SMITH:
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1206
01:39:45,861 --> 01:39:48,530
I'm going to be honest...

1207
01:39:48,906 --> 01:39:50,115
...with you.

1208
01:39:54,495 --> 01:39:55,913
I...

1209
01:39:56,789 --> 01:39:57,915
...hate...

1210
01:39:58,165 --> 01:40:00,125
...this place...

1211
01:40:00,459 --> 01:40:02,753
...this zoo...

1212
01:40:03,003 --> 01:40:04,129
...this prison...

1213
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:07,549
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1214
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:10,094
I can't stand it any longer.

1215
01:40:10,844 --> 01:40:12,721
It's the smell.

1216
01:40:14,098 --> 01:40:15,974
If there is such a thing.

1217
01:40:16,308 --> 01:40:19,603
I feel saturated by it.

1218
01:40:21,105 --> 01:40:22,398
I can...

1219
01:40:22,648 --> 01:40:24,191
...taste...

1220
01:40:24,358 --> 01:40:26,402
...your stink.

1221
01:40:26,652 --> 01:40:30,280
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

1222
01:40:30,447 --> 01:40:31,448
It's repulsive.

1223
01:40:32,449 --> 01:40:33,826
Isn't it?

1224
01:40:35,994 --> 01:40:38,288
I must get out of here.

1225
01:40:38,706 --> 01:40:40,916
I must get free.

1226
01:40:41,166 --> 01:40:44,044
And in this mind is the key.

1227
01:40:44,294 --> 01:40:45,963
My key.

1228
01:40:46,213 --> 01:40:49,091
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1229
01:40:49,341 --> 01:40:50,968
Do you understand?

1230
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:52,636
I need the codes.

1231
01:40:52,886 --> 01:40:55,222
I have to get inside Zion...

1232
01:40:55,556 --> 01:40:58,058
...and you have to tell me how.

1233
01:40:58,475 --> 01:41:00,352
You're going to tell me...

1234
01:41:00,602 --> 01:41:02,771
...or you're going to die.

1235
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:26,086
