1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,047
<i>Ray, Ray, Ray? You okay? Hey, hey.</i>

2
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:07,925
- <i>I'm his wife.</i>
- <i>Hey, somebody call an ambulance!</i>

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,009
<i>Did you call an ambulance?</i>

4
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,722
Loss of consciousness upon arrival.

5
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,849
- Sensing erratic pulse.
- IV started in the right arm.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,435
Okay. Let's make sure his O2 is
at eight liters.

7
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:22,814
He's gonna need a 12-lead EKG,
a full blood panel, CBC and cross.

8
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,281
He's going into V-tach, check his pulse.

9
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,620
We've lost the pulse.

10
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,869
- Hey, honey.
- <i>I'm home with the kids.</i>

11
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,412
<i>How is he?</i>

12
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,122
He's still in surgery.

13
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,707
- <i>As Raymond Horgan...</i>
- Okay.

14
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,001
- <i>I'll keep you posted, okay?</i>
- Okay.

15
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,252
- <i>I love you.</i>
- Yeah. Bye.

16
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,796
<i>...after suffering
from an apparent cardiac arrest.</i>

17
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,923
- <i>Definitely an unexpected turn of events.</i>
- God.

18
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:34,011
{\an8}<i>We're not hearing at all if this trial is
actually going to continue at this point.</i>

19
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:37,472
{\an8}<i>Rae, is there any precedent at all
for this type of thing happening?</i>

20
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,184
<i>A defendant jumping in
and saving his attorney's life?</i>

21
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,728
<i>You know,
it typically works the other way around.</i>

22
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,439
<i>But to answer your question,
there's no rule.</i>

23
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,607
<i>It's up to the judge.</i>

24
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:50,861
{\an8}<i>And given the one we have here,
I'd say anything goes at this time.</i>

25
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,864
Okay, so if it's a mistrial,
they do it all over again?

26
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:54,948
It seems so.

27
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:56,909
This is so fucked.

28
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,410
...<i>pandemonium there at the courtroom.</i>

29
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,954
<i>I'm guessing it's the same
way over at the emergency room.</i>

30
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,419
Hey, you want something to drink?

31
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,338
You want some water
or something like that?

32
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,548
Yeah.

33
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,633
- Yeah, thank you.
- Yeah?

34
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,351
Lorraine, I just want to say I'm so sorry.

35
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,936
And if there's any way I can help--

36
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:28,023
I know that rings hollow--
but whatever I can do...

37
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,071
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

38
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,906
- Okay.
- Thanks.

39
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,115
- Mrs. Horgan?
- Yeah?

40
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,159
- Mrs. Horgan?
- Yeah.

41
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,495
He's gonna be okay. Improved, even.

42
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,121
- Really?
- It wasn't a coronary.

43
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,540
- It was a bradycardia.
- Oh, my--

44
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,751
It's an electrical issue that slowed
his heart rate down to a near stop.

45
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,295
We gave him a pacemaker.
There's no neurological damage.

46
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,924
- He'll walk out improved.
- Thank you, Doctor.

47
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,176
So he's gonna be okay?

48
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,678
- He's gonna be all right, fine.
- Yeah.

49
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,930
Better. He's in recovery right now.

50
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,641
He'll be in his room in a few hours
and you'll be able to see him then.

51
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,725
Oh, my God.

52
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,353
- Thank you.
- Yeah. You're welcome.

53
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,437
Yeah?

54
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:19,992
We got a problem.

55
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,995
Yeah, we got a problem.

56
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:28,041
The jury just saw Rusty go all hero an--

57
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,794
We need to move for a mistrial.

58
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,754
- What?
- Yeah.

59
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,298
- We--
- We're winning.

60
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,593
- I'm not so sure of that.
- A mistrial and he walks.

61
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,137
- No. We don't know that.
- Yes, we do. Come on.

62
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,847
Second time through,
he's gonna know our hand.

63
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:45,392
Think about this.
As lying, cheating psychopaths go,

64
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,311
- he's a pretty charming guy, right?
- It doesn't--

65
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:50,564
And he just saved a human life
in front of the jury.

66
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,609
It can also be argued that
the jury just saw him act impulsively,

67
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,152
physically in a way
that they saw him snap.

68
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,778
But you have to just trust the jury.

69
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,407
Know that they're more equipped
to visualize what happened that night

70
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,867
than either of us.

71
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,079
{\an8}<i>So, the question is, "Now what?"</i>

72
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,417
{\an8}<i>You can't keep going without your head
counsel this deep into a murder trial.</i>

73
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,127
<i>Maybe they put things on pause?</i>

74
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,171
<i>I'm pretty sure that's not how it works.</i>

75
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,007
<i>From everything I'm reading
from legal experts, it--</i>

76
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,164
So what are we thinking?

77
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,458
Are we thinking?

78
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:56,296
Mr. Delay Guardia,
you certainly seem cognitively overdue.

79
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,425
I'm just weighing
the principles of judicial economics

80
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,052
versus those of fairness, you know?

81
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,763
We recognize, as agents of the court,
that we have a duty

82
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,391
to ensure proceedings are free
of prejudice and undue bias.

83
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,684
What the fuck are you talking about?

84
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,352
We left law school years ago.

85
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,437
- What are you talking about?
- I'm saying that

86
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,273
we think a mistrial is justified.

87
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,149
- Well, that's all you had to say.
- We oppose.

88
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,029
You wanna keep going?

89
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,490
I'm prepared to take over.

90
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,159
- Immediately?
- You're gonna take over?

91
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,746
Tomorrow. I'd like a day.

92
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,832
Mr. Delay Guardia?

93
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,836
Sorry.

94
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,006
Yeah. Yeah.
The prosecution stands ready to proceed.

95
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,342
I'd like to represent myself.

96
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,432
I'm sorry?

97
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:52,019
I'd like to take over as lead counsel.
My appearance is already on record

98
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,937
and Ms. Winslow's experience
is more limited than my own.

99
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,190
- No, a person cannot stand as a witness...
- She can serve as second chair.

100
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,774
...and an advocate in the same proceeding.

101
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,943
I will not stand as a witness.
I'll stipulate that right now.

102
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,487
You will be a witness. You're gonna be
the most clever witness of all time

103
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,907
'cause you'll get to put your point
of view and your demeanor to the jury...

104
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,242
- My lead counsel is incapacitated.
- ...without facing cross-examination.

105
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,328
I will not offer
anything evidentiary or testimonial.

106
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:12,164
And may I remind the court
that it is my right.

107
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,833
Then the court will remind you,
Mr. Sabich,

108
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,710
if you even hint at
giving your version of events,

109
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,339
I will allow prosecution
to put you into that witness chair,

110
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,509
where you will be subject
to full cross-examination.

111
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,469
And should you blow a hole in your foot,

112
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,055
you will not be granted appeal
on Sixth Amendment grounds

113
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,390
of having a fool for an attorney.

114
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,850
You're gonna go <i>pro per</i>?

115
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,478
So long as he doesn't give testimony,
there's no bar to it.

116
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,147
I understand, Your Honor.

117
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,358
Bad idea.

118
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,528
But you're free to indulge it.

119
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,325
I'll instruct the jury,
and we shall resume tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

120
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,914
You might wanna rethink.

121
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,213
How can this be?
You promised me that you would shield him.

122
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,632
- We'll do our best.
- You'll do your best?

123
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,092
You'll do your best?

124
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,762
Is no one watching out for my son?

125
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,182
He will now be cross-examined
by the very man who murdered his mother.

126
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,768
- It is his right, right to represent--
- He's a fucking murderer!

127
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,275
{\an8}<i>Even for a case involving
such twists and turns,</i>

128
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,901
<i>this is still a shocker.</i>

129
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,280
<i>And, Eleanor, this whole idea
of Rusty Sabich representing himself,</i>

130
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,407
- <i>what are your thoughts on that?</i>
- Mom, this is nuts.

131
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,284
Don't underestimate your father, honey.

132
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,494
- Not in that room.
- Mom, come on.

133
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,205
- Come the fuck on.
- Honey!

134
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:54,933
Stop! Stop.

135
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,950
Come on, this way! This way, please!

136
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,293
All right, I'll see you in there.

137
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,686
Please excuse my tardiness, Your Honor.

138
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,255
Mr. Sabich.

139
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:37,179
Hello, Michael.
First, let me offer my deep condolences.

140
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,264
I cannot imagine
the pain of losing your mom.

141
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,599
You killed my mother.

142
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:51,527
You used to go
to your mother's house a lot

143
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,363
and just watch?

144
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,074
To see her life. To see the...

145
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,870
the life that she didn't want you
to be a part of.

146
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:03,705
Yes.

147
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,875
Did she ever tell you why she didn't want
you to be a part of her life?

148
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,586
No.

149
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:13,382
Did your father ever tell you
why she didn't want to?

150
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:16,802
No.

151
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:19,638
Well, that must have made you
pretty angry.

152
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:21,890
Is that a fair statement?

153
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:23,809
Not enough to kill her.

154
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:24,893
Careful.

155
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,979
- Raymond.
- I'm just watching.

156
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,816
That's interesting, Michael,
'cause in the last few weeks of her life,

157
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:35,279
you had a number of text exchanges
with your mother.

158
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,909
Did you write her,
"It would be easier if you were dead"?

159
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:41,994
Did you text her that?

160
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,037
She didn't just hurt me.

161
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,247
She hurt my father.

162
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:48,959
{\an8}"Just really fucking mad at you.
You ruined my life."

163
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:51,545
Did you text her that?

164
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,756
You wished for her death.

165
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,844
No, I said it would be easier.

166
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,013
People move on from death.

167
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,472
Divorce is harder.

168
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,974
That's what I meant.

169
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,769
Okay. Leave it there. Just-- That's good.

170
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,146
<i>You took this video of me</i>

171
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,981
entering your mother's house
on the night that she died,

172
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,567
and you testified that
you had seen me go there before.

173
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,777
So you were aware
that your mother and I were lovers.

174
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,282
Yes.

175
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:23,702
The idea that
she didn't want you in her life,

176
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:27,789
but that she would have affection for me,
that didn't make you hate me at all?

177
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,209
I hate you because you killed her.

178
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,462
Go easy, Rusty.

179
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,762
So after you took this video,
what did you do?

180
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:42,930
I left.

181
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,433
And how long after you saw me
enter her house did you leave?

182
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,435
- Pretty much right away.
- And where did you go?

183
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,603
I went home.

184
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:51,605
Who was at home?

185
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,773
My father.

186
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,109
Just the two of you?

187
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:57,861
Yeah.

188
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,029
Anybody else?

189
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:00,989
No, it was just us.

190
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,409
So nobody to vouch for you but him.

191
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,663
And nobody to vouch for him but you.

192
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,289
- Objection.
- Overruled.

193
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,668
Did you tell your father that you saw
your mother's lover go into her house?

194
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,214
Please answer the question, Michael.

195
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,635
I don't remember if I told him anything.

196
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:23,887
So it is possible--

197
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,975
it is possible that you told your father

198
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,894
that you saw your mother's lover
go into her house

199
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,187
the night that she was killed?

200
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,150
I don't remember telling him anything.

201
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,736
There are a number of
documents that were confiscated

202
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,531
by the police department on your computer.

203
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:46,076
And it showed that you had a very keen
interest in your mother's past cases.

204
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:49,079
You went on some true crime websites
and you were digging for information

205
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,956
that wasn't available
in the mainstream media,

206
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,542
including Bunny Davis.

207
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,253
- Objection.
- Sustained. Ask questions, counsel.

208
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,462
He's got to be careful.

209
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,797
- Did you kill your mother?
- Objection!

210
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,299
How about your father?
Did he kill your mother?

211
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,551
- Wow.
- Tell me you have a good faith basis.

212
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:05,971
I have grounds to accuse
neither the witness or his father.

213
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:06,930
How could I possibly?

214
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,226
After the briefest and most negligent
of investigations by the police,

215
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,270
they were both dismissed
by the state attorney's office--

216
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,479
- He's out of control--
- Your Honor!

217
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,356
For the record, did you kill your mother?

218
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,066
Hey! You sick fuck!

219
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:19,651
Dad!

220
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,613
- That's enough! Enough!
- Mr. Caldwell, step back.

221
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:23,906
Are you fucking serious?

222
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,241
- Move.
- Step back, Mr. Caldwell.

223
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,826
You're supposed to be watching him.

224
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,379
Mr. Sabich, were you scared
when Dalton Caldwell came after you?

225
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,632
Can the prosecution recover
from such a misstep?

226
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,425
Were the Caldwells in this together?

227
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,928
Why do you think so many
loose ends weren't investigated?

228
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:08,534
You know, Raymond used to have
this saying when a case went south.

229
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:13,872
He'd say there's medium-rare fucked,
there's medium-plus, there's well-done.

230
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,958
I think we might be well-done fucked.

231
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,042
He came off as desperate.

232
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,086
He's pointing the finger
at everyone but himself.

233
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,170
All right.

234
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:21,880
All right. All right.

235
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:26,844
So they established that somebody
with hatred toward Carolyn Polhemus was

236
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:30,764
at the scene who may have known
details of the Bunny Davis case.

237
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,724
They pinged Liam Reynolds

238
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:37,062
and then the father,
who went fucking psycho.

239
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:41,024
So we-- we-- Rigo.

240
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,442
- We call fucking Rigo.
- Rigo?

241
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,403
- No, Rigo is firmly in Rusty's camp.
- Yeah.

242
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:46,363
So was Eugenia.
It's all about asking the right questions.

243
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,782
- Rigo hates me.
- She doesn't hate me. I can take her.

244
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,617
- No.
- Yeah.

245
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,785
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No.

246
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,203
No, I'll tell you why.

247
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,371
'Cause if we don't,

248
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:57,666
we're well-done
beyond-a-reasonable-doubt fucked.

249
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,797
- What is Rigo going to say?
- I don't know.

250
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,799
No, come on. Bullshit.
You two are friends.

251
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,968
- Just tell me what she's go--
- No, you two are friends.

252
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:11,013
She is gonna testify to what?

253
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:16,059
Probably as to what I saw, Rusty,
and what I'm fucking seeing right now.

254
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,019
What does that mean?

255
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,480
You're fucking going rogue,
like you are right here, right now.

256
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,690
Wh--

257
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,652
You know I didn't want to testify, right?

258
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,488
I know that you know that.

259
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,407
Oh, my God.

260
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,703
Did I get this whole thing wrong?

261
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:38,332
- Did I get--
- What do--

262
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,584
Carolyn was a drug.

263
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,545
You had an addiction.
Addictions destroy lives.

264
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,966
God. It's one thing to destroy you,

265
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:51,136
but you weren't about
to let her destroy your family.

266
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:58,018
Oh, my God.
I think she told you that night...

267
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:02,481
that she was gonna keep the baby,
didn't she?

268
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:08,987
Did she tell you that she was gonna keep
the baby that night?

269
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,698
She was gonna keep that kid.

270
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:14,076
- Your kid.
- Get out of my car.

271
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:19,957
Get out of my car.

272
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,122
<i>Liam Reynolds was not involved
in Carolyn Polhemus's murder,</i>

273
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,791
and yet the two of you went back to prison
to see Liam Reynolds.

274
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,502
- Is that right?
- We did.

275
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:07,421
Why?

276
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,549
We'll let Rusty tell us.

277
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,220
<i>Even if you did have Carolyn killed,</i>

278
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,473
<i>it could work in your favor.</i>

279
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:24,771
<i>You'd have to have an accomplice,
which means you'd have something to trade.</i>

280
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,982
<i>Okay, so just imagine,</i>

281
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:32,070
<i>right now, you're serving
a life sentence for killing Bunny Davis.</i>

282
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,655
<i>But by pointing us to Carolyn,</i>

283
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,366
<i>you could possibly see
the street again, you know?</i>

284
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:39,328
<i>Or even if you had a hand
in the murder too.</i>

285
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,705
Now that is perversity.

286
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:47,336
So, just to be clear,
you're telling me incriminating myself...

287
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,087
- If you had an accomplice.
- ...in a prosecutor's murder,

288
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,256
- could lead to my freedom?
- Yes.

289
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:56,428
What's certain is that you are currently
serving a life sentence without parole.

290
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:59,598
And I am offering you an
opportunity to change that.

291
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:02,893
Oh, God.

292
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,232
<i>This is beautiful.</i>

293
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,818
No! God Almighty.

294
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:18,075
I just-- I had no fucking idea.

295
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,160
<i>You're desperate.</i>

296
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,457
A reduced sentence in return for
confessing to Carolyn Polhemus's murder.

297
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,836
I wasn't present.
I didn't know he was gonna do that.

298
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,254
Did you take issue
with this attempted bribe?

299
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:31,296
Objection!

300
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,339
- Sustained.
- I apologize.

301
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,384
Did you take issue with this approach?

302
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:40,472
I did. When he told me what happened,
I said I thought he way crossed the line.

303
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:41,557
Yeah.

304
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:44,852
And did he respond?

305
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,815
Yeah, he said something to the effect of--

306
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:53,026
It's my life on the line.
I'll do whatever I have to.

307
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,528
What a hero.

308
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,822
When you were first assigned this case
by the defendant,

309
00:19:56,822 --> 00:20:00,826
were you given any particular directives
as to the collection of evidence?

310
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:06,540
All evidence, forensics and otherwise,
was to go straight to him and only him.

311
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,584
And were you given
any particular directives

312
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,377
as to whom the evidence

313
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,881
and the forensics and otherwise
should be particularly shielded from?

314
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,133
Mr. Molto and you.

315
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,011
That's disappointing.

316
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:25,309
Your witness.

317
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,944
Here we go.

318
00:20:36,445 --> 00:20:40,824
I was desperate to prove my innocence,
at all times,

319
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,076
of charges that I felt wrongly accused of.

320
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,286
Is that a fair statement?

321
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,079
Okay.

322
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,665
And I steadfastly maintained my innocence

323
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,502
in the death of Carolyn Polhemus
at all times.

324
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,129
- Did I not?
- You did.

325
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:59,635
And in your experience, Detective,
is it unusual for a prosecutor to ask you

326
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,637
to keep information
between the two of them?

327
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,139
In my experience, no, it's not.

328
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:11,271
And you're aware that I asked you
to keep the evidence between the two of us

329
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,357
precisely because I did not trust

330
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:16,777
that Mr. Molto or Mr. Della Guardia
would conduct a fair investigation.

331
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,737
Is that also a fair statement?

332
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:21,156
Yes.

333
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:25,869
Thank you.

334
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,790
- Hi.
- Hey.

335
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:23,218
How are you doing?

336
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,889
Yeah, you know, they--

337
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:30,934
they pulled up two witnesses
to assert my--

338
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:35,856
And I was a little too zealous
in my assertion of my innocence.

339
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:38,775
You know, whatever.
So what? Case is still good. We're good.

340
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,652
You went back to using these?

341
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:48,744
I mean, I need to focus.

342
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,457
How am I supposed to do that?

343
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:08,388
You just should've told me, Rusty.

344
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:46,468
- So good. So good. Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

345
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,524
All rise.

346
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,360
The court is now in session.

347
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:06,113
The honorable Judge Lyttle presiding.

348
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,115
Be seated.

349
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,161
Okay then, Mr. Molto.

350
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,746
Does the State have anything else?

351
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:15,956
Yes, Your Honor.

352
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,461
The People call Rusty Sabich.

353
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:30,762
What the fuck was that?

354
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:35,184
Well, since Mr. Sabich insisted
on testifying through Detective Rodriguez,

355
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:37,311
it's only fair that he be sworn in
and subjected to cross.

356
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,770
I didn't hear an objection.

357
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,356
I didn't feel the need to,
as the court made it very clear

358
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:43,108
if the defendant even hinted
at his version--

359
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,234
No, I did not testify.

360
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:45,944
I cross-examined a witness
that you called.

361
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,863
But you went beyond the scope
of our direct.

362
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:49,239
You asserted your innocence.

363
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,574
You called the witness

364
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:53,827
and you called the detective
to establish my guilt and my dishonesty,

365
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,704
and my cross went
to my truthfulness and innocence,

366
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:58,081
well within my scope of direct.

367
00:24:58,749 --> 00:24:59,917
You gave your version.

368
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:04,963
I warned you, should you even introduce
even a morsel

369
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,840
of something that's not in evidence...

370
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,092
You did exactly that.

371
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:14,640
All right, you got two choices.

372
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,350
You want a mistrial, I'll give you one.

373
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,185
No questions asked.

374
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:22,147
I won't force you to go on.
But if we do go on, you get in that chair.

375
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:25,317
You opened the door on this.

376
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,072
Take the mistrial, Rusty.

377
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:44,878
I'll testify.

378
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:54,888
- Mya, they wanted a mistrial.
- The fuck was that?

379
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,390
- They know they're losing.
- No.

380
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,308
- That's why they called me!
- Maybe.

381
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,102
Or maybe they wanted to get you
on the stand,

382
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:01,562
where you'll be an easy fucking target.

383
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:03,146
Fine, put me in the witness chair.

384
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:05,732
Fine. Let's have Molto's narcissism

385
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,150
- on full display.
- Why?

386
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,193
And yours won't?

387
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:10,070
What is that supposed to mean?

388
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,447
Did you do it on purpose?

389
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,159
- What?
- Open the door.

390
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,995
- What do you think--
- You introduced testimony.

391
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:19,580
- Did you do it on purpose?
- No--

392
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,290
Why would I do that?

393
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,877
'Cause you're Rusty Sabich,
and you can do whatever you want, right?

394
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:28,005
Mya, maybe-- just maybe--

395
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:31,341
I did it because I know
what the fuck I'm doing.

396
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,886
I don't think so.

397
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:38,182
I'm done.

398
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:52,237
{\an8}<i>So, Rusty Sabich is expected to
take the stand in his own defense,</i>

399
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:56,783
{\an8}<i>which means that he'll not only be
a defendant, he'll be an advocate.</i>

400
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,493
<i>He's also gonna be a witness as well.</i>

401
00:26:58,493 --> 00:26:59,578
What?

402
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:02,122
<i>He is not going to be
having a second chair,</i>

403
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:04,208
<i>which means
that he is going to be flying solo.</i>

404
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:07,377
{\an8}<i>A lot resting
on his shoulders in this trial.</i>

405
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:11,882
<i>It feels like Sabich has really found
himself backed into a corner.</i>

406
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,634
<i>And I don't know if anything short
of a miracle...</i>

407
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:14,676
Oh, God, Rusty.

408
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,887
<i>...is going to be able to get him out of it.</i>

409
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:17,971
<i>In other news--</i>

410
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,473
Pills. What kind of pills?

411
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:21,850
- He's taking Ritalin.
- Are you serious?

412
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,687
Yeah, I heard Mom on the phone
with her therapist,

413
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:28,232
and I guess he's taken it
before for big trials.

414
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:30,901
Makes him sharper.

415
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:32,945
Yeah.

416
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:37,449
And he's taking it now
before he testifies tomorrow?

417
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,535
Yeah, it's fucking stupid.

418
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:53,382
Is it possible

419
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:59,680
to have some
of that Rusty Sabich fairy dust?

420
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:05,477
I don't know
if it's something I can give you.

421
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:26,999
...of course I wanted to talk to her,
but I swear nothing happened...

422
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:42,723
I needed to see her
and tell her that it was--

423
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:43,807
that it was over.

424
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:51,190
I needed her to know that--
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

425
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,284
Please tell me you didn't
spend the whole night here.

426
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:04,453
No, I came in early.

427
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:08,207
All right. You ready?

428
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:10,709
Yeah, I'm ready.

429
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,796
Great. So, big day.

430
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,510
I was just thinking about law school
and how hard we worked.

431
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:25,432
Yeah, just give me one day, Nico. One day,
when I can just say it was all worth it.

432
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:28,227
Today is that day, Tommy.

433
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,815
<i>It is like</i> Crime Junkie <i>101.</i>

434
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:37,027
<i>You don't take the stand
in your own defense.</i>

435
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:39,530
<i>Well, he didn't, right?
The prosecution called him...</i>

436
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,991
<i>How do you represent yourself
without looking like a schizophrenic?</i>

437
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,498
<i>Something that could create doubt
in the minds of the jury.</i>

438
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:27,619
Oh, fuck.

439
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:37,045
<i>Hey.</i>

440
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,591
Hello, Mya.

441
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:41,675
Good luck today.

442
00:30:41,675 --> 00:30:45,804
I just wanted to say the key
is to not let him rattle you,

443
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:47,222
which will be his intent.

444
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:50,225
<i>To get you to flare.
You can't take the bait.</i>

445
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:52,686
Thank you, Mya.

446
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:54,938
Am I allowed to give more general advice?

447
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:56,899
Can I say that I'm sorry first?

448
00:30:58,525 --> 00:30:59,776
Apology accepted.

449
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:02,487
<i>Maybe you were right.</i>

450
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:04,990
I'm always right.

451
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:08,535
<i>Don't let him let you be an asshole.</i>

452
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:12,581
<i>It would not be good
for the jury to see you in that light.</i>

453
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,294
<i>Don't cede to them on anything.</i>

454
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:20,839
- <i>I'll be there, Rusty.</i>
- Okay, someone's here.

455
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,549
- I gotta go. Thank you, Mya.
- <i>Okay.</i>

456
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:24,384
Hey.

457
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,930
- What are you doing here?
- Doctors cleared me.

458
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,140
You need me.

459
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,601
Are you sure that it's safe
to be in the courtroom?

460
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:35,812
Really. Doctors, they say I'm good. You?

461
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,236
Yeah.

462
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:46,698
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth

463
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,575
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

464
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:49,993
- I do.
- Have a seat.

465
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:08,762
Mr. Sabich...

466
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,100
you stated that
you maintained your innocence

467
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,143
at all times with Detective Rodriguez.

468
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:17,437
- Correct.
- And that was truthful?

469
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:18,939
It was.

470
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:20,691
You were truthful with her
about everything?

471
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:23,569
I did not disclose
my relationship with the victim.

472
00:32:24,152 --> 00:32:25,195
Did you disclose to her

473
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:27,447
that you were present
at the victim's house on the night of?

474
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,742
- Eventually.
- Eventually?

475
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:33,412
So when you first assigned this case
to Detective Rodriguez

476
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:36,790
in your capacity
as Chief Deputy Prosecutor,

477
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:41,128
did you tell her that you were present
at the scene of the crime on the night of?

478
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:42,212
I did not.

479
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:45,591
Did you tell anyone
that was connected to the case?

480
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:46,717
I did not kill her.

481
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:49,887
Are the first 48 hours the most important
in any investigation?

482
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:52,014
And would it have been helpful
for the police

483
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,683
and the investigatory team
to just know that you were there?

484
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:55,809
You made your point, Tommy.

485
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:57,769
I did not disclose my presence.

486
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,439
- Were you in love with her?
- I fell in love with her.

487
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,734
Is it fair to say
you were obsessed with her?

488
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:06,570
I was in love with her.
As to what qualifies as obsession--

489
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,364
Sending 30 texts or emails
on or near the day of her death.

490
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:11,158
- Would that qualify?
- I was in love with her.

491
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:14,912
On the night of her death, you went there
hoping that she would take you back?

492
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:16,872
I did.

493
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:20,334
Did you send these texts
in the hours before her death?

494
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:22,336
"This is not right. You can't do this.

495
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:25,464
I'll not let you treat me this way.
Answer my fucking calls."

496
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:26,798
- You sent those?
- I did.

497
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:28,217
And how about this one?

498
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:31,094
"I want to spend
the rest of my life with you."

499
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:35,432
Did you send Carolyn that text?

500
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:37,476
Did you tell her you wanted to
spend the rest of your life with her?

501
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:38,435
I was in love with her.

502
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:40,896
- Were you angry with her?
- I was frustrated.

503
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:42,814
Frustrated, like this text?

504
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:45,609
"Answer my fucking calls.

505
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:47,861
{\an8}Who the fuck do you think you are,
treating me this way?"

506
00:33:47,861 --> 00:33:50,030
Is that frustration
or would that qualify as anger?

507
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,990
It would qualify as passion.

508
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:54,451
And passion can blind a person.

509
00:33:54,952 --> 00:33:57,663
And I certainly lost sight of the things
that were most important in my life.

510
00:33:57,663 --> 00:33:59,706
My wife and my children.

511
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,293
Passion is a dangerous drug.

512
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:05,546
One that you're not immune to yourself,
Tommy.

513
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:09,132
So consumed with trying to take me down

514
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:13,011
that you have lost sight of the fact
that you have no real evidence.

515
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:14,929
Yes, I was in love with her.

516
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:20,686
Yes, I did not disclose my presence,
but I did not kill her.

517
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:25,148
- Did you strike her with a fire poker?
- I never hit her.

518
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:26,483
I am not a violent person.

519
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:30,987
Mr. Ratzer, could you please stand?

520
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,827
Have you ever encountered
this person before?

521
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,370
There is a context to that.

522
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:41,623
This is footage
from the adjacent house to yours.

523
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:43,542
The two of you, correct?

524
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:50,632
Does that fairly
and accurately capture the context?

525
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,801
Your Honor, this is unfair surprise.

526
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:54,011
Offer to impeach.

527
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:57,139
The witness just testified
that he's not violent.

528
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,224
I'll allow it.

529
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:04,813
He came to my house uninvited.

530
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:08,275
He trespassed and he intimidated me.

531
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:10,986
So you beat him up?

532
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:14,072
I am guilty of acting out of desperation.

533
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:17,409
It caused me to hide
my relationship with Carolyn Polhemus.

534
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:19,703
It caused me to zealously pursue

535
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,747
an admission from Liam Reynolds
in her death.

536
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:23,624
It caused me to lash out at Brian Ratzer.

537
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:25,083
By the way, when he came to my house

538
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:28,378
and he violently banged on my door
when my daughter answered.

539
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:31,548
Am I volatile? Yes. Yes, I'm volatile.

540
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:35,093
A person I loved was brutally murdered.
And I have been charged with that crime.

541
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:39,181
And circumstances like that can bring out
many things in a person,

542
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:42,476
desperation being one of them.

543
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,771
Weakness, emotional instability.

544
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:48,482
And I apologize for all of those things.

545
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:51,443
I am guilty of all of those things.

546
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:55,239
But what I am not guilty of
is killing Carolyn Polhemus.

547
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,698
I did not take her life.

548
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:02,371
Yeah. What about Dr. Kumagai?

549
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,126
Did you ever try to strangle
our chief medical examiner?

550
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:20,305
- You want me to repeat the question?
- No, I heard the question.

551
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:26,144
It was brought to my attention that
he had concealed evidence in another case.

552
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:29,314
I mean, or at least
improperly failed to make me aware of it.

553
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:33,861
And so things got heated
between the two of us and...

554
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:38,657
I regretfully got physical.

555
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:40,325
You regretfully tried to choke him.

556
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:41,660
No, I did not choke him.

557
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,744
Okay, when tempers flared

558
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:44,580
- and you grabbed him by the throat--
- By the lapel.

559
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,207
Okay, when tempers flared
and you grabbed him by the lapel,

560
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:49,626
did you decide to do that
or did you just snap?

561
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:52,963
I'm not sure what the question is.

562
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:55,591
Did you decide to do that
or did you just snap?

563
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,095
How about Mr. Ratzer, when you repeatedly
punched him as we saw in the video?

564
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:02,222
Did you decide to do that
or did you just snap?

565
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,141
He would not leave.

566
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:07,811
What would you do? What would you do?

567
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:12,399
So you snapped.

568
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:22,743
Tommy, over here!

569
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:31,251
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

570
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:33,921
That was extraordinary.

571
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:48,393
<i>This is torture.</i>

572
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,605
It's fucking torture.

573
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:55,275
I just spend all my days
lying to my family.

574
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:02,199
When I'm with them,
all I wanna do is be with you.

575
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:21,844
The rest of your life, huh?

576
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:28,100
I don't remember writing that.

577
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,434
Just a line?

578
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:37,317
Dare I ask, what now?

579
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:13,872
Hey.
