1
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,680
Thank you.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,160
Morning.

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,920
-Morning, Cliff, let me take that.
-Thank you.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,880
CLIFF: Up all night
with these bloody things.
At a time like this, for God's sake!

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,480
-Going to have a pizza.
-TERRI: Have you got the digest,
please? Thank you.

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,120
TERRI: Um...

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,200
-TERRI: Would you mind taking them?
-Oh, why?

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,760
Um, Malcolm's there.

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,040
Malcolm? Where? In there?

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,240
-In there.
-Why?

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,720
It's just a social call.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,680
-A social call? Jesus Christ!
-Yeah.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,800
Um...have you got him coffee?

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,360
TERRI: Did you get him coffee?
Has Malcolm Tucker got coffee?

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,800
WOMAN: I thought you were organizing it.
CLIFF: Oh, for Christ...

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,560
Get coffee, get, um, Danish pastries,
croissants and...

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,360
TERRI: Danish pastries, croissants...
CLIFF: No, no, no!

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,160
-Fruit! Get lots of fruit.
-Can you get fruit?

19
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,000
A pile of fruit and lots of coffee.
Now! Okay?

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,720
MALCOLM: No, he's useless.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,600
He's absolutely useless! He is!
He's useless! He's as useless as
a marzipan dildo. All right.

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,280
So, I've got to go.
The minister's just walked in.

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,240
-CLIFF: Don't interrupt your call
because of me.
-You're a minister of the Crown.

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,000
You don't need to listen
to all of my chutney!

25
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,400
I'm sure it's much, much
more interesting than chutney.

26
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,160
No, no, no. It's... It's a...

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,000
my cock-up, as usual. I thought that
Graham Dixon was doing a briefing,
and it turns out it's Graham Hughes.

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,640
Too many Grahams around.
We ought to kill some of them.

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,800
MALCOLM: Exactly!

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,160
-So...
-So...

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,920
-God, look, I'm sorry about the
fuck-up about the coffee.
-Oh, God...

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,960
How am I supposed to run a department
if I can't get the Prime Minister's
enforcer a cup of fucking coffee?

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,240
No, no, that's okay.
Listen, the thing is...

34
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,440
you are doing a bloody good job
here, Cliff.

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,000
-'Cause with all this shit in the paper
about whether I'm going or not...
-Yeah.

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,160
Have you seen...

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,280
Terri, can you bring the  Mail  in,
please? Have you seen the  Mail?

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,720
-MALCOLM: Is that "Lawton dangles
by a thread"?
-Yeah!

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,120
Dangles by a thread!

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,440
CLIFF: It's all right. We've got...
TERRI: "Lawton dangles by a thread"?

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,560
-Yeah, we've got. It's okay.
-TERRI: Do keep it.

42
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,320
Yeah. No, just leave it there.
Thank you, Terri.

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,920
MALCOLM: There's a lot of them,
isn't there?

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,640
It started with the Telegraph diary,
but just more and more and more.

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Seriously, the PM likes you personally.

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,800
I like you personally, and we've
absolutely no desire to get rid of
you. I just want you to know that.

47
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,400
None of this negative stuff
is coming from us.

48
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,320
CLIFF: Oh, no, mate. That...

49
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
...makes a big difference.
Makes me feel a lot more secure.

50
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,880
MALCOLM: Does it?

51
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,120
Well, it's difficult.

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,240
What's difficult?

53
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,720
Just endless headlines, day after day.

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
-It's chipping away at confidence.
-Absolutely.

55
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,360
The thing is, we're starting to look weak.

56
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,840
Everybody's saying, "When's
he gonna go. When's he gonna go?"

57
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,760
Right.

58
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,200
And you don't want us
to look weak, do you?

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,680
No, no.

60
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,560
So there you are.

61
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,360
That's why you've gotta go.

62
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,800
-No.
-Yes.

63
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,520
-No.
-KNOCK AT DOOR

64
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,640
-WOMAN: Would you like some coffee?
-Fuck off!

65
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,880
-WOMAN: Tea?
-You fuck off, darling.

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,800
CLIFF: Malcolm, look, um,

67
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,000
if you do this, it's the bollocks
of the jungle out there, you know?

68
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,200
They're like wolves, pissed wolves.

69
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,120
I've made the announcement.
I've told the lobby you're going, Cliff.

70
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,120
You've told the lobby I'm going?

71
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,880
Yeah. Sorry, Cliff.

72
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,160
-Minister.
-Yeah, get used to "Cliff".

73
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,120
I've booked you in for the usual
soapy-tit-wank farewell
at Number 10 in 20 minutes.

74
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,160
I've also drafted
you a letter of resignation.

75
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,760
Gives you the chance to say that
you're jumping before you're pushed,

76
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,840
although, obviously, we're going to be
briefing that you were pushed. Sorry.

77
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,040
Um,

78
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,640
look, tell you what,
you don't need to do all this.

79
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,520
What about Tom, yeah? Everybody
knows he's fucking up Transport.

80
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,320
We can't sack Tom at Transport.
We can't lose anyone at Transport,
they're important.

81
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,760
What, and Social Affairs isn't?

82
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,880
Oh, okay, the Department of Social Affairs
is very important, but it's not Transport.

83
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,360
Transport's cars, buses, trucks...

84
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,360
I know what Transport
fucking entails!

85
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,920
Look, look...

86
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,480
CLIFF SIGHS DEEPLY

87
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,440
I'll look at them.

88
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,600
"Personal reasons"?

89
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,720
Yeah. I thought that would
give you adequate scope.

90
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,880
Scope?

91
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,840
What like, um, shooting up in the Cabinet
office or something? What?

92
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,840
Stuffing a cat up my arse
and having a wank? What do you mean?

93
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,680
You know, this could be
a great deal worse.

94
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,200
You have had a good innings.
You have been here for 18 months

95
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,080
and, you know, I have written
some very nice things about you
in the PM's reply to your resignation.

96
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,000
Some very nice fucking things indeed!
I had a lump in my throat,
and you know why?

97
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,760
Because no-one who matters thinks any
the less of you over this. So far, okay?

98
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,800
Right, one more thing.
The Daily Mail.

99
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,760
David Topham has got it into his head
that we are going to sack you,
because of Press pressure.

100
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,960
I wonder why?

101
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,600
Look, you're in no position to dish out
fucking sarcasm, that's over.

102
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,880
You no longer have purchase
in the sarcasm world!

103
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,560
Get on the phone,

104
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,080
tell them that you're jumping
before you are pushed.

105
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,160
Although we were going to push you,
but not because of press pressure,

106
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,440
but because of your deeply-held fucking
personal issues, whatever they were.

107
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,720
You want me to write my own obituary?

108
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,920
Get on the fucking phone.

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
Do it now.

110
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,160
MAN: Morning.

111
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,560
HUGH: Good morning.

112
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,480
TERRI: Have you seen the  Times?
HUGH: No.

113
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,680
Jo Cherman. She's been
a bit of a bitch, actually.

114
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,440
-Well, she always is.
-Yeah.

115
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,120
OLLY: Everything in this package is small.

116
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,040
We'll go down, the local yokels
will take photographs and that's fine.

117
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,320
They'll snap away for 20...
20 minutes is enough.

118
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,600
-He's here now, so don't worry.
-Morning, Hugh!

119
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,720
Good morning.

120
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
ALL CHATTERING

121
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,000
HUGH: Come on!

122
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
-GLENN: Terri...
-Shush!

123
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,440
I've got something very important
to say. I've got...

124
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,840
Olly, I've got something for us.
I got us a very tasty little morsel,

125
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,360
because this morning, I had a chat
with my very good friend
the Prime Minister of Great Britain.

126
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,960
-Oh, really?
-Oh?

127
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,920
Yes, and remember the, um...

128
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,000
Olly, your benefit unit fraud...

129
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
Anti-Benefit Fraud Executive, ABFE.

130
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,800
ABFE? Um, Scrounger Squad?

131
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,080
-OLLY: Snooper Squad.
-Snooper Squad!

132
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,480
-The one with spending implications?
-HUGH: Yes.

133
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,560
The Prime Minister's view is,
"Fuck the spending implications,
I like it."

134
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,960
-Good.
-So this is us, we're on the map.

135
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,160
It's a chance for me, Glenn, to get
on Richard And Judy and plantthat
flag right on their fucking sofa.

136
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,600
So the Prime Minister's authorized
you to announce it? Has he?

137
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,600
Well, that's very much
what he signalled, yes, very clearly.

138
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,800
He said he's right behind us on this
and it's what we should be doing.

139
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,560
This is great. So we can do it
this afternoon at the school, can't we?

140
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,200
-We can clear the press conference and...
-Excuse me.

141
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,320
Yeah, we'll double-bubble it. Yeah?
We'll leak it to the Standard,
then trail it on  The World At One,  yes?

142
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,080
Right, we need someone
at the  Standard  we can give this to.

143
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,680
What about Angela Heaney?
She's at the  Standard  now, isn't she?

144
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,080
-Yeah.
-Yeah, Olly?

145
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,640
Um, yes, she is.

146
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,640
Do you not think that
maybe she's a bit junior?

147
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,400
A bit too much like your ex, who
broke your heart then dumped you
with a text message?

148
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,800
It was a fucking e-mail!
It wasn't a text message.

149
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,440
GLENN: We'll give it to her.
She'll write what we want. She's easy.

150
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,080
-She's easy.
-HUGH: Yeah, she is easy.

151
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,000
I can see that you've all got big,
stiff hard-ons for this...

152
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,360
HUGH: Sorry?

153
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,400
That is nice. I'm not saying
that's not nice but...

154
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,600
HUGH: Terri?

155
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,400
...there is no way we'll clear it
by this afternoon so...

156
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,600
OLLY: Why not?

157
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,800
You can cool it, just for a minute,
and I'll ring Paul at the Treasury.

158
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,240
ALL: No! No, no!

159
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,000
No phone calls to the Treasury.
Thank you.

160
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,920
If you call the Treasury, he's
going to have to dress up
as catering with a big tray of drinks

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,440
-and a pot of sliced lemons...
-I'm not doing that.

162
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,640
OLLY: They'll just take it.

163
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm just going by procedure.

164
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,680
Terri, I love doing things
the right way, that ethical stuff,
I love it, we all do,

165
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,960
but it's very difficult when you're
the first person to put the gun down,

166
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,480
because people tend to jump on your head
as if it's a ripe watermelon.
We don't want that, do we?

167
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
TERRI: Okay.

168
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,680
The Prime Minister is above
the Treasury in the hierarchy.

169
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,800
I can write it down on a chart,
if it actually helps.

170
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,360
-TERRI: Whatever.
-Thank you.

171
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,240
-Very good, Minister, I'll get to it.
-OLLY: Yeah.

172
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,920
-You're just doing your job.
-OLLY: Yeah.

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,440
SOFTLY Not very well.

174
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,640
Will you get Angela
on the phone for Olly?

175
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,240
You can deal
with this, Olly, yes? Thank you.

176
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,560
-The driver...
-Technically.

177
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,720
-Will it be my usual driver?
-Yes.

178
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,240
-Don't fucking like him.
-GLENN: Why not?

179
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,800
He's...I don't know.
I think he despises me.

180
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,920
We'll have to use him today, because
you know how the pool system works.

181
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,280
So we go down to the school, um...

182
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,200
He's sort of contemptuous.

183
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,440
-GLENN: The driver?
-I feel like he looks down on me.

184
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,440
No. Hugh he likes you, I'm sure.

185
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,760
BEEPING ON CAR RADIO

186
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,520
NEWSREADER:  The World At One,
this is Nick Clarke with 30 minutes
of news and...

187
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,920
Well, you can fuck off for a start.

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,080
This afternoon
the Social Affairs Secretary,
Hugh Abbot...

189
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,440
Evening.

190
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,960
-First story up.
- ...Funding for an anti-fraud
executive to include

191
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,320
a uniformed so-called Snooper Force.

192
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,600
The announcement suggests the DSA
has pushed the Treasury
into releasing more funds,

193
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,920
so we'll ask, is the Treasury
losing its central policy?

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,120
Yes it is and not before time.

195
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,800
We'll talk to Opposition spokesman,
Mark Davis Nathenson...

196
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,520
If you can get him out of the bath.

197
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,040
But first, estimates of
fatalities from yesterday's train disaster
in Bangalore have risen overnight...

198
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,120
-That's marvellous.
-MOBILE RINGS

199
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,800
Oh, Tucker. Malcolm.

200
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,920
What the fuck was that? Was this
whole Snooper Force thing from you?

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
HUGH:  Malcolm I...

202
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,720
I talked to the PM and this is
completely Kosher, as far he's concerned.

203
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,200
He gave the go ahead
and he said, you know,

204
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,440
"Bounce the Treasury."

205
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,040
Don't you realise, we have got
17 different issues we're fighting
with the Treasury about!

206
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,240
I can hear that you are,
as usual, upset...

207
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,080
I'll tell you why I'm upset. I'm upset
because these fucking morons
over at the Treasury,

208
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,520
these people, they are so paranoid.

209
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,120
If you don't tell them about stuff
like this, or CC them an e-mail,

210
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,320
they think you've started
a palace coup!

211
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Malcolm...

212
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,800
You don't seem to understand

213
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,640
that I'm going to have to mop up
a fucking hurricane of piss here
from all of these neurotics.

214
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,760
What did the Prime Minister
actually say to you?

215
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,800
He actually said, "This is exactly
the kind of thing we should be doing."

216
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,480
What did he actually say?

217
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,120
He said, "This is exactly the sort
of thing we should be doing."

218
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
"Should be doing."

219
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,600
"Should" does not mean "yes".

220
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,560
MALCOLM:  Now, there's only
one thing to do here, and it's what

221
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,760
I'm going to tell you
to do. Kill it!

222
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,840
I can't kill it. I'm on my way
to make the announcement.

223
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,720
There's gonna be television cameras there
and everything.

224
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,760
Well, fuck the television cameras.
Think of something else to say,

225
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,040
but just don't mention the bloody
New Avengers or the Snooper Force
or whatever the fuck you call it!

226
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,280
Scam-busters.

227
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,480
Get rid of it! I don't want to
hear about it again. Bye!

228
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,680
Hugh, talk to me. Hugh,
what's going on? What's the matter?

229
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,120
-We're going to have to do a number
of things almost immediately.
-Like?

230
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,320
-What's the problem?
-Fuck.

231
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,800
What? Hugh, what?

232
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,800
-Stop saying what.
-Right.

233
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,680
I shouldn't have been sucked in.
I was sucked in!

234
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,240
Is this Tucker jumping on this?

235
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,160
I think he was right.

236
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,760
He's always fucking right.

237
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,000
No, he's not always right.

238
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,480
"Should",

239
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,520
does it mean "yes"?

240
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,960
Yes, we should do this.

241
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Hugh...

242
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,600
When Tucker was talking
to me, "should" didn't mean "yes".

243
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,400
I mean, it really didn't.

244
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,760
I felt like a fool.

245
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,400
This is nice.

246
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,440
Yeah, this is very nice.

247
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,200
This is just work, isn't it?
I mean, we're not...

248
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,520
Yeah, no, absolutely. No, no...
Nothing like that.

249
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,760
It's just, you know, deadline.

250
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,920
Yeah, sure.

251
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Something like,
Social Affairs Minister Hugh Abbot

252
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:24,480
will today announce a tough new crackdown
on benefit fraudsters.

253
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,800
Um, paragraph.

254
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,360
Yeah, I can do the punctuation, Olly.

255
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Sorry.

256
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,640
Actually, I did have it written down
a bit better. I've got it on a thing
on a piece of paper.

257
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,560
Oh, that's fantastic, Olly.
Can I just have that?

258
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,280
-Sure, yeah.
-That's great.

259
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,600
Easier all round, isn't it?

260
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,000
It's all...It should all be there.

261
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,280
I've done it in capitals
and everything on, so... Cool?

262
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,840
I think I'll say
senior government sources.

263
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,080
Thank you very much.

264
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,560
It sounds better.

265
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,960
Yeah, of course.

266
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,560
-Olly! Come on!
-Over here, Olly!

267
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,720
Sorry.

268
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,680
-What's that you've got?
-Olives.

269
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,880
-Olives?
-Do you want one?

270
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,360
He's brought his own olives.

271
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,560
GLENN:  So the line is,
and call every news desk,

272
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,240
that the Snooper Force story
is that it was let out by,

273
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,720
quote, a disgruntled
civil servant, unquote. Okay?

274
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,840
Okay, great.

275
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,200
-And Terri...
-Mmm?

276
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,440
You can drop that tone, all right?

277
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,560
What tone?

278
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,360
The I-knew-better-all-along tone, yeah?

279
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,600
It isn't fucking appreciated right now.

280
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,320
Bye.

281
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,440
The thing is,
the story isn't a story...

282
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,960
What do you mean?

283
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,600
The Snooper Force.
It's not happening.

284
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,200
None of that is actually...
None of that is actually happening.

285
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,560
-I...I can't do this.
-You've got to do this.

286
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,880
I mean, yeah, you know reading,
talking, I get...I get car sick.

287
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,000
I've got to stop. We've got to stop.

288
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,760
Jesus Christ.

289
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,360
Do you think you could pull in
at the next lay-by?

290
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
As far as the department
is concerned...

291
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,840
As far as the Government is concerned,
there is no Snooper Force.

292
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,640
What's going on? Has the Treasury
gone ballistic? What's happened?

293
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,800
-No, no.
-Why? What...

294
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Why is this flip-flop?

295
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,520
No, there's no flip-flop.
Nothing like that, there's no...

296
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,520
This isn't a...change in policy
in any...in any respect.

297
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
No.

298
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,000
What's going on , Olly?

299
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,040
No, well, the truth is that
I acted beyond my brief.

300
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,680
What are you talking about?

301
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,960
I don't know. I just kind of wanted

302
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,440
to play the big man in front of you.

303
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,720
-You came out and you
just made something up?
-No, no.

304
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,240
Listen, I'm... I'm really so sorry.
If it's any help...

305
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,360
The line that we're giving to
everybody else is that there's
a disgruntled civil servant.

306
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,760
They leaked the story.

307
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,080
Got a name?

308
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,440
Do I have a name
for the disgruntled civil servant?

309
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,400
Well, Derek. Derek...

310
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,720
-MOUTHING Terri.
-Terri. Terri.

311
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,000
No, we're gonna pick a name.
-No. Wait.

312
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,080
We're gonna pick a name. I'm so sorry.

313
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,320
-I'm so sorry about this.
-Oh. This is ridiculous.

314
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,280
-No, it's not...
-Did you plan all of this?

315
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,320
The last thing I want to do today
is be stuck in a fucking lay-by,

316
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,600
by a Wacky Warehouse
begging my ex-girlfriend.

317
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,200
All right. So what the hell
am I going to say

318
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:26,120
is the reason for me summoning
all the nation's major news organisations

319
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,400
to a school in Wiltshire?

320
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,200
So you want something sexy
and eye-catching and that is free
and universally popular

321
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,280
and instantly applicable,
no-one can possibly object to it?

322
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,040
-GLENN: Yeah.
-Yes.

323
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,120
You should have said something
before, Glenn, because I've got
a file about that fucking thick of that

324
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,720
back in the office! Those sorts
of policies are ten a penny!

325
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
GLENN: Olly!

326
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,120
Our entire manifesto
is more or less made up of them.

327
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,280
It doesn't help
when you get cynical.

328
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,040
You should think of this
as an opportunity.

329
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,040
It's not that easy to come up
with  Das Kapital  in the back
of the cab, Glenn!

330
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
-Olly.
-Here. Shave.

331
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,480
GLENN: What we need is something
that the public want,

332
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
is incredibly popular and is free.

333
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,120
Return of capital punishment.

334
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,480
That's a joke, right?
You are joking, yes, obviously?

335
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,120
Come on, Olly.
Come up with something.

336
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,760
National spare room database?

337
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,800
What about zoos?

338
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,920
My kids went to a zoo the other day

339
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and they said it was fucking disgusting,
the state of it.

340
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,920
That's shit, isn't it?

341
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,680
No. But there is an idea there,
because in the middle of the city
you've got wild animals.

342
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,400
Pet ASBOs. Remember, ASBOs for pets?

343
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,000
That sounds potentially ludicrous,
but then pet passports. I mean
that was a...that was a goer.

344
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,200
GLENN: What if everybody
had to carry a plastic bag,

345
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,040
by law. You know the identification
cards are coming in...

346
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,000
You've fucking cracked! Are you mad?

347
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,680
OLLY: What if the announcement is...

348
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,600
there's no big announcement.

349
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,560
-HUGH: Oh, for goodness...
-No, no wait.

350
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,360
We say the Department of Social Affairs
has been doing amazing work,
bread-and-butter work,

351
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,720
belt-and-braces work, the kind of work
that you people aren't interested in.

352
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,760
'Cause it''s not shiny,
shiny media-friendly stuff.

353
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,720
You're obsessed with how things
play in the media, you sickos.

354
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
GLENN: Sickos.

355
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,160
-That every time we try and do it,
we just carry on with our day...
-Yeah.

356
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,440
...you don't show up,
so we have to call a big...

357
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,720
Quiet bread and butter?

358
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,480
-On target, under budget...
-Coal-face politics.

359
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,480
-Coal? Absolutely, yes, I like it.
-Not wasting resources.

360
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,320
-Let's do that.
-Let's go for that.

361
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,800
We trick them by...a tinselly
thing, and they come along
and then we say, "Ah..."

362
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,520
That's what we've been doing! We've
been doing our fucking jobs! Yes,
they never print that stuff, do they?

363
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,200
And you've come all this way.
We've got you two hours out
of London to cover this.

364
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,760
You mugs! You mugs!

365
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,960
You've got a bigger story here
than you have chasing your tinsel.

366
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,480
Yeah, which is you live in a country
which is properly...There's not many
countries can say that.

367
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,840
And we've probably got
ten million we can throw at it.

368
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,880
-Yes. That's good, that, because
it sounds like a lot. Doesn't it?
-Yeah.

369
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,480
I've got a thing here that says
"springy concrete". I don't know.

370
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,920
-I think that's about
the playground but I don't...
-"Springy concrete"?

371
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,560
Good afternoon, hello.
Should I say, "Hello, boys and girls"?

372
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,840
GLENN: Yes, very nice.

373
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,400
No, it's going to go out
on the television.

374
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,400
It'll look ridiculous if he's on
the six o'clock news
saying, "Hello, boys and girls."

375
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,800
He's talking to the audience...

376
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,560
-Real money for real families...
-He's not patronizing them!

377
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,360
HUGH: Real families or real people?

378
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,160
-Real people.
-Families.

379
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,800
-You see...families.
-Real people.

380
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,440
Families sounds exclusive.
It sounds back to basics.
It sounds John Major, so...

381
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,320
-"People" sounds communist.
-It doesn't sound communist.

382
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,920
-HUGH: I'll say families.
-Thank you, Hugh.

383
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,600
Say "families of people".

384
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,920
WOMAN: Mr Abbot.

385
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,280
HUGH: Great.
GLENN: You're on, here we go.

386
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,480
GLENN: It's what you do best, mate.
HUGH: Yep.

387
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,400
HUGH: This is lovely.
Very nice indeed.

388
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
Well, that was a fucking disaster.

389
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,760
-Well, that...
-Shut up.

390
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,440
Thank you.

391
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,000
Ah! Well done.

392
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,720
There's absolutely nothing
in the  Standard . Big fat nothing.

393
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,480
-Nothing?
-You've got away with it.

394
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,840
He's managed to create
a press conference so boring
that none of the Press will even touch it.

395
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,720
Genius.

396
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,080
Fucking well done, mate!
You turned it around.

397
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,320
INDISTINCT CHATTERING

398
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,480
Well, you really pulled it round, mate.

399
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,000
I took the flack.
You supplied the flack jacket.

400
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,280
Yeah, and the bullets bounced off.

401
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,080
This is what it's all about, Glenn.

402
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,840
All those years at the coal-face,
hanging in, taking all the shit,
all the bullshit.

403
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,640
When you're senior Cabinet minister,
then we'll show them.

404
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,560
-Yeah, and Snooper Force...
-What?

405
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,880
Bollocks, we'll get rid of that.

406
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,120
Oh, for fuck sake, yeah.
Fiddling while Rome burns.

407
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,320
Fucking right. We'll kick...

408
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,400
We'll kick some arse, kick some butt.

409
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,160
That's what we're in it for, mate.

410
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,720
Instead of all the shit that we do.
Have to do. It's a means to an end!

411
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,720
Fuck me, Malcolm! How do you do that?

412
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,080
Can I have a word with you?

413
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,280
DOOR SLAMS

414
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,440
MALCOLM SIGHS DEEPLY
I'm hacked off, mate.

415
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,480
But we...we killed it. It's killed.

416
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,360
Yeah. But once you start the fire,
Malc, and we didn't start the fire.

417
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,360
It's always burning since
the world's been turning, etc. etc.

418
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,120
Sorry, Malcolm, you're
not making any sense.

419
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,760
Prime Minister, obviously he's
on the plane in Stockholm, and somebody
hits him with  The World At One.

420
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,640
He thinks it's the Treasury
trying to stiff him one, so he...

421
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,760
He stuck with the story.

422
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,240
He liked it?

423
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,680
Yeah, he's backing
the Snooper Force.

424
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,440
Oh, right.

425
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,560
We shouldn't really then...

426
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,520
I mean, you shouldn't
really have told us to...

427
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,840
should you? LAUGHS

428
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,840
Don't should me, Hugh,

429
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,920
'cause I'll should you right back.

430
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,280
I'll should you right through
that window. None of this should
be happening, should it?

431
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,320
Should it? Should it?

432
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,800
Is that "should" in the sense
of "yes" or...

433
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,320
-It's should in the sense that you
should do as you're fucking told.
-Yes.

434
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,840
What...

435
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,640
What are we going to do now?

436
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,920
You're going to completely
reverse your position.

437
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,920
Hang on a second.
Malcolm, it's not actually that...

438
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,720
I mean, that's going to be
quite hard, really.

439
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,240
Yes, well, the announcement
that you didn't make today...you did.

440
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,600
No, I didn't, and there were
television cameras there
while I was not doing it.

441
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,920
Fuck them.

442
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,680
I'm not sure what level of reality
I'm supposed to be operating on.

443
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
Look, this is what they run with.

444
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,920
I tell them that you said it,
they believe that you said it.

445
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,080
They don't really believe you said it.
They know you never said it...

446
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
Right.

447
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,400
But it's in their interest
to say that you said it because
if they don't say that you said it,

448
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,280
they're not going to get what you
say tomorrow or the next day,

449
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,840
when I decide to tell them
what it is you're saying.

450
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,600
Yeah. I am following this. I just...

451
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,200
I had a friend who used to indulge
in extramarital affairs, okay?

452
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,760
He'd go off
and he'd have some dalliance

453
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,000
and every Monday, he'd come back
and he'd meet his wife,

454
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,120
and he told me that all he did

455
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,760
was, inside his head, turn a little
switch, the affair never happened.

456
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,960
-Okay?
-Right.

457
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,440
There's no...
What is the problem with this?

458
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:49,120
The problem with it... First of all,
I didn't get much dalliance.

459
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,360
Get it into your head.
Rewind today in your head.

460
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,280
Okay, stop explaining it to me.

461
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,000
I have to fucking explain it to you, man.
You haven't been here long enough.

462
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,200
INDISTINCT CHATTERING

463
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,800
Where are all the people?
Where are my people?

464
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,280
Um, they've gone home,
Secretary of State. It's 5:40.

465
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,320
Okay, well, um, listen.

466
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,840
The situation is, um,
it's pretty terrible,
but things have changed, okay?

467
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:25,280
The line is now I did announce
the Snooper Force this afternoon
at the school.

468
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,680
Okay, that's what happened, all right?

469
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,880
So now you have to tell all the media

470
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,560
in case they missed it.

471
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,320
Okay?

472
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,920
Great.

473
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,760
SOFTLY I said at the beginning of today
that this would happen!

474
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,720
All right, it's happened.
It's nobody's fault, Terri.

475
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,320
Now we have to get a list of everyone...

476
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,520
It's not my fault.

477
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,680
I didn't say it was your fault, Terri.
I said what we have to do...

478
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,560
You said it was nobody's fault,
but t is somebody's fault,
it's your fault and your fault.

479
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,760
OLLY: It's not my fault.

480
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,520
You can't walk away from this
because if you do I'll make sure
it's pinned on you.

481
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,640
Everything going okay?

482
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,000
GLENN: You cunt!
TERRI: We're fucked!

483
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,600
HUGH: Great.

484
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,360
GLENN: This is the real world, Terri.
TERRI: We're fucked.

485
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,920
-How's it going?
-HUGH: Good.

486
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,360
I think they might need
a little bit of co-ordination.

487
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,280
Who spoke to Nicky Campbell?
Has anyone spoken to Nicky Campbell?

488
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,080
I've got one missed call here,
Nicky Campbell.

489
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,600
It's become so complicated,
and it's actually terrifically simple.

490
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,520
There was always going to be
a Snooper Force policy.
That's absolutely definite.

491
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,880
It's too good a policy to be invented
by a disgruntled civil servant.

492
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,320
I'm really glad you came in.
Angela, you know...

493
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,320
-Well, I could lose my job, Olly.
-Yeah.

494
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,640
Because I went all hot and heavy
to the news desk with three directly
contradictory stories in one day.

495
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,920
-I know.
-They gave me flip-flops.

496
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,920
You know, someone actually went out
and bought flip-flops to give me.

497
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,120
Yeah.

498
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,480
You've got to give them credit
for that, though. That is quite funny.

499
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,320
Yeah, and they pasted onto them,

500
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,520
a fucking porn picture of a girl
sucking a big cock,

501
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,800
and they wrote,
"Angela Heaney swallows anything."

502
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,880
That is less funny, obviously.
That's actually quite offensive.

503
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,280
Can you give me one good reason
why I shouldn't do a big story on the...

504
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,360
you know...on the day of spin?

505
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,840
Why? What sort of story...

506
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,000
You know, inside story of a
Government department out of control,
with diagrams and a flow chart

507
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,360
with your face and name on it,
Glenn's, Hugh's, and big arrows
showing who spoke to who

508
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,000
and how you all fucked it up!

509
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,760
Yeah, I think I could
write that one myself, Olly.

510
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,320
I could do the punctuation
on that one.

511
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,120
I'm sorry. Okay, I was patronising.

512
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,160
Hi, Angela. Oh, I like the hair,
nice little corkscrews. How's it going?

513
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah, um, fine.

514
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,440
We were just, um, talking about

515
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:48,320
why Angela shouldn't do a big story
on the big insidery piece,

516
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,560
kind of day-of-spin
sort of spread in the paper.

517
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,160
I don't know.
Maybe you should.

518
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,760
Good idea.

519
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,440
Oh, wait a minute.

520
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,320
I know why she shouldn't,
because if she did that, she'd be dead...

521
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,680
to me, to this department,
to the Government,
and she'd never get another story,

522
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,880
or a fucking whiff of a story,
so long as she kept
her sorry hack bitch face

523
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,480
lingering around Westminster,
because I would call every editor I know,
which, obviously, that's all of them,

524
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,360
and I would tell them to gouge her name
out of their address books

525
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,920
so she'd never even get a job
on hospital radio,
where the Sad Sack belongs.

526
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,840
That's what I'd tell her.

527
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,960
But maybe you should do it.

528
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,200
-See you later.
-OLLY: Yeah.

529
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,120
He's actually...

530
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,520
He can be really nice.

531
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,600
It's been a very long day.

532
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,640
I didn't say that we weren't doing it,
which is as good as saying
that we were. Bye.

533
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,120
The World Tonight.

534
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,000
Hello? Hugh Abbot here...

535
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,680
Yes, no it's always a pleasure
to speak to  The World Tonight.

536
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,320
Go live on air now?

537
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,720
Yes, of course,
I'd be delighted to.

538
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,640
Robin, my pleasure.

539
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,840
Nice to be with you.

540
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,160
Yes. Before I answer that question,
may I say how delighted I am,
as we all are in the department,

541
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,880
at the excitement and enthusiasm
that our Benefit Fraud Inspection Unit
has created.

542
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:26,360
I announced at a press conference
this new Benefit Fraud Inspection Unit,

543
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,880
which we are hoping to call...

544
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,240
Sponge Avengers,

545
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,320
and, um, at that press conference

546
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,760
there seems to have been
a bit of a blip,

547
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,600
because many of the journalists
didn't pick up on the announcement.

548
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,760
I think they're so much looking for...

549
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,000
ON RADIO:  a bit of scandal
or incompetence, so that statement

550
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,520
that the policy was the invention
of a disgruntled civil servant

551
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,280
was actually the invention
of a disgruntled civil servant.

552
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,560
No, there's only one
disgruntled civil servant,

553
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,640
because one of them's...
One of them's an invention...

554
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,720
by the other one, you see?

555
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,280
HUGH: Anyone listening carefully
would have just thought I sounded
completely mad.

556
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,200
GLENN: No, they won't. It was very good.
You came over loud and clear.

557
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,280
It's going to put the whole thing
to bed, anyway. Kill it.

558
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,000
And Olly's offered Angela
a Private Life piece about you.

559
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,160
HUGH: Oh, great.

560
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,520
GLENN: A Sunday with you and the family,
go for a walk, spend time with you.

561
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,960
HUGH: She'll be checking through my books
and snooping in my bathroom cabinet

562
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,240
and making snide remarks about how
I don't know who Gail Porter is!

563
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,040
-We did dick her about, Hugh.
-Yeah.

564
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,920
And we're getting a roasting
at the moment

565
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,120
from what has been dubbed,
but I wouldn't call, flip-flop Friday,

566
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,920
-so we need all the help
from friends we can get right now.

00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
HUGH: I know.

568
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,720
Look, what do you think?

569
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,840
Well, I just think that...

00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,000
I want a new driver.

572
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,120
Get me a new driver. I don't want to
see this guy ever again.

573
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,840
On what grounds?

574
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,880
Smiling. Inappropriate smiling.

575
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,800
And smirking. Smiling and smirking.

576
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,120
I don't want to see
that smile or smirk ever again. Okay?

577
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,840
Thank you.

578
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,360
Okay, thank you very much.
