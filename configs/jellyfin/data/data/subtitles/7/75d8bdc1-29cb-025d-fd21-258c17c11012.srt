1
00:00:07,365 --> 00:00:08,725
For any new inmate,

2
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:12,725
the first day in our small hell
is usually the worst,

3
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:17,125
but for Cleaver Greene,
every day was worse than the last,

4
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:19,645
and that's how we wanted it.

5
00:00:19,765 --> 00:00:22,645
Cleaver had no shortage of enemies -

6
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:28,085
former attorney general Cal McGregor,
close mate of the Justice Minister

7
00:00:28,205 --> 00:00:30,245
and therefore untouchable.

8
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:34,845
My right-hand man, Colin Mancusi

9
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:39,805
and me, Mick Corella,
who would never forgive that fucking dog

10
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:42,885
for tooling my wife, Kirsty.

11
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:48,125
And then there was my brother.

12
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:52,485
Georgie had already done 12 years
of a 160-year stretch

13
00:00:52,605 --> 00:00:56,205
when I was put away - quadruple murder.

14
00:00:56,325 --> 00:01:00,245
What he did to those fellas
even makes me turn white,

15
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:03,245
and I cut a bloke
into a dozen little pieces

16
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:06,125
and had him buried under asphalt.

17
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:14,685
All the other blokes thought
we'd be as thick as,

18
00:01:14,805 --> 00:01:20,205
but my first day inside was the first
day we'd seen each other for 20 years.

19
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:22,525
It was the first time we'd met

20
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:27,125
since I stole his fiancée,
Kirsty Fitzgibbon, from him.

21
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:31,125
The power of love should never
be underestimated.

22
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:37,805
I figured, after 20 years,
Georgie might have got over Kirsty,

23
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:40,565
but I couldn't have been more wrong.

24
00:01:40,685 --> 00:01:43,685
I'm not going to tell you
how he killed me,

25
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:46,805
‘cause I'm sensitive like that.

26
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:05,725
Welcome to the end of days,

27
00:02:05,845 --> 00:02:09,485
and abandon all fucking hope,
ye who enter here.

28
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:51,965
It is the unanimous finding
of this court

29
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:58,805
that the guilty verdict in the case
of the Crown and Greene was unsafe.

30
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:02,805
The trial itself was riddled with
untrustworthy witnesses,

31
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:06,805
three of whom have been convicted
of perjury as a result.

32
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:11,285
We find that His Honour erred
in both allowing and disallowing

33
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:17,325
certain crucial pieces of evidence
to be put and not put before the jury.

34
00:03:17,445 --> 00:03:22,325
Given the totality of these egregious
miscarriages in the passage of time,

35
00:03:22,445 --> 00:03:28,245
we did not find that a fair
and transparent trial could be held.

36
00:03:28,365 --> 00:03:31,645
The conviction is therefore quashed,

37
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:35,005
and the appellant is free to go.

38
00:03:56,765 --> 00:03:58,245
Yes.

39
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:06,325
I've built up a bit of a hunger
and a bit of a thirst.

40
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:08,445
A man's not a camel.

41
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:11,045
Harry!
I wasn't expecting to see you here.

42
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:13,285
I just wanted
to be one of the first to say

43
00:04:13,405 --> 00:04:15,805
that I knew you'd eventually
beat this thing, Cleaver.

44
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:19,685
Oh, mate. That's very decent of you.

45
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:23,125
‘Cause you always manage
to slime your way out of things.

46
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:24,605
- David!
- Always.

47
00:04:24,725 --> 00:04:27,725
A sweet old man is dead because of you,

48
00:04:27,845 --> 00:04:30,645
but it's time to party,
isn't it, Cleaver?

49
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:33,605
I told you I'd put an end to you
one day.

50
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:42,325
Malcolm!

51
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:45,485
Malcolm!
For the love of Judith Christ, mate,

52
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:48,205
do we have to have this conversation
again?

53
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:54,085
Look, it's not that I don't like you.
I do, as a friend, OK?

54
00:04:54,205 --> 00:04:57,885
But I'm telling you,
for the five billionth time,

55
00:04:58,005 --> 00:04:59,765
it's not going to happen.

56
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:02,965
- This is more than just a prison thing.
- So you keep saying.

57
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:06,165
You're my rock. You're my port
in a storm. You're my soulmate.

58
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:09,925
I can't be your rock
and your port in a storm, mate,

59
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:11,605
‘cause that's just a shipwreck.

60
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:14,245
I can't help feeling this way.

61
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:16,725
And I can't help not feeling that way.

62
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:20,845
I can't help not being
sexually attracted to you.

63
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:25,405
It's nothing personal, mate,
it's just the way I was built.

64
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:30,165
I get out in six weeks.
We don't have much time together.

65
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:34,405
Look, you're tired.

66
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:36,245
We're all tired.

67
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:40,605
I can't remember
the last good night's sleep I had.

68
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:42,965
Sorry.

69
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:51,965
Oh, for the love of perpetual motion,
will you stop it?

70
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,405
Mate, I've been in here 11 months

71
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:58,685
and I can't think of a single thing
worth having a go at myself over.

72
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:00,845
You've been in here 17 years.

73
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:03,525
It's only possible because of you.

74
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:21,525
That's it!

75
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:30,005
I wish I was on laundry detail.
How do you get on laundry detail?

76
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,805
Kitchen's not that bad.

77
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,645
I've known fine dining.

78
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:39,205
I've known eggs
that didn't come in powdered form.

79
00:06:39,325 --> 00:06:42,965
I've known meat
that came from actual cows.

80
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:46,565
So Georgie's got his stuff
for breakfast, right?

81
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:49,965
Yes.
Georgie's got his stuff for breakfast.

82
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:54,885
'l have met them, close of day,
coming with vivid faces

83
00:06:55,005 --> 00:07:00,165
from counter or desk among grey,
18th-century houses.'

84
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:04,845
Oh, Patrice!

85
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:07,245
You look...

86
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:09,805
..happy with yourself today.

87
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:11,685
Got a new arrival coming.

88
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:13,565
Oh, yeah?

89
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:15,805
Kirsty's nephew, Connor.

90
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:17,925
Got done for extortion.

91
00:07:18,045 --> 00:07:22,125
Lovely boy. Kirsty dotes on him.

92
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:26,445
Figured I might take him under my wing,
look after him.

93
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:31,165
Kirsty would appreciate that,
don't you think?

94
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,125
'Course, mate.

95
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,925
She'll come. I know she will.

96
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:38,125
She'll come...

97
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:41,325
..see us, see her boys.

98
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:44,325
'Course she will.

99
00:07:45,885 --> 00:07:48,605
Fuck! Why are you telling me that
over breakfast?

100
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,925
Where are you going to stay
when you get out?

101
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:01,565
I don't know. My sister's?

102
00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:05,965
You'll be a free man. You've got your
whole life waiting for you out there.

103
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,045
I've been in here since I was 18,
Cleave.

104
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:12,445
- I've got no life outside.
- You're going to have to start one.

105
00:08:12,565 --> 00:08:16,205
Who's going to give me a job?
I murdered my dad.

106
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:19,605
Who beat your mum to death. Yeah?

107
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:24,445
- That's not the way the judge saw it.
- Oh, I remember old Fitzie.

108
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:26,605
Crazy old fucker.

109
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:28,365
Can we get a bit of volume?

110
00:08:28,485 --> 00:08:31,965
Justice Kieran Webster was sentenced
to six years for perjury

111
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:33,525
- and corruption...
- Fuck!

112
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:36,005
..In relation to the now infamous
Cadamaya land deal.

113
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,005
- Another one.
- The former judge was a friend

114
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:41,565
of former Labor Party power broker
and Planning Minister, Vince McCarthy.

115
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:43,125
Vincie!

116
00:08:43,245 --> 00:08:45,645
..and former Gaming Minister,
Paul Fennely...

117
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:47,645
Hey, Pauly!

118
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:51,605
..who are both serving eight years
for their role in the Cadamaya scandal.

119
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:55,485
Sentences are expected to be passed
on five others later this week.

120
00:08:55,605 --> 00:08:57,125
No, no, it's OK.

121
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:04,805
Oh, really?

122
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:09,205
What about Stein? He's a bloody silk.
I thought he was...

123
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:12,965
Shit!

124
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:18,125
All rise.

125
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:32,125
Be seated.

126
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:36,245
This is a very serious matter

127
00:09:36,365 --> 00:09:39,045
that could affect the cohesion
of our community.

128
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:42,445
I'd like to thank my fellow judges
for making themselves available

129
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:44,085
at such short notice.

130
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:49,325
The court would also like to send
its best wishes for a speedy recovery

131
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:55,125
to Mr Stein QC, who somehow
lost a fucking ear last night.

132
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:57,725
Mr Greene will appear in his place.

133
00:09:57,845 --> 00:10:00,485
Let's hear the charges.

134
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:03,925
Today,
Your Lordship and Your Honours sit

135
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:08,365
to oversee a charge against our friend
Tonto here,

136
00:10:08,485 --> 00:10:11,205
of, quote, "Trying to slip one up Paddo

137
00:10:11,325 --> 00:10:15,805
while they were on laundry detail,
unquote.

138
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:19,045
My friends of the jury,
you all know Tonto.

139
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:21,085
This is his fourth stretch for B and E.

140
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:24,725
Never copped a plea.
Never took a lesser charge,

141
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:30,005
never, ever grassed -
a thief whose honour is beyond dispute.

142
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:35,085
What happened in the laundry
was an easily explained accident.

143
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:39,645
Gentlemen, there is no way that I will
dispute the honour of a good thief.

144
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:42,725
I am many things
but I am not a hypocrite.

145
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:48,565
This case is not about B and E,
my friends, it is about B and D.

146
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:50,045
Objection.

147
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:52,325
It's a fucking good line.
I'm going to allow it.

148
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:56,045
Despite my friend's submission,
Your Lordship cannot possibly accept

149
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:58,645
a slipped-in-the-shower defence

150
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:02,445
for the simple reason
the offence did not occur in the shower,

151
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:03,925
it occurred in the laundry.

152
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:07,405
Your Lordship, the slipped-in-the-shower
defence is honoured in every wing

153
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:08,965
of every jurisdiction in the land,

154
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,605
not just literally
but in its clearly intended spirit.

155
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:14,165
I find that a very broad interpretation,
Mr Greene.

156
00:11:14,285 --> 00:11:16,925
Absolutely, yes - fucking broad.

157
00:11:17,045 --> 00:11:21,485
My Lord, we all know what is meant by
‘slipped in the shower.'

158
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:24,645
It means that
the incident was an accident.

159
00:11:24,765 --> 00:11:26,565
It's an allegory, a conceit.

160
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:31,365
Your Lordship, whatever the currency or
plausibility of the expression may be,

161
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:36,285
it derived from the fact that when
people in showers slip, they are naked.

162
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,365
People on laundry detail are not naked.

163
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:42,965
This was an attack on Paddo.

164
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:46,365
I am reliably instructed

165
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:51,845
that Paddo, in what may have been
an innocent bout of rambunctiousness,

166
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:57,965
flung a bucket of water over my client
and himself, rendering them both sodden.

167
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:01,205
My client was the sodden one, Cleaver.

168
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:05,085
My client and Paddo,
in this brutal winter period,

169
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:08,085
were forced to remove
their moistened clothes

170
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,565
in order to put on dry ones.

171
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:14,285
The floor in the meantime,
having become moist and slippery,

172
00:12:14,405 --> 00:12:15,765
was a water trap.

173
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:20,005
My client slipped, instinctively
grabbing Paddo's shoulders

174
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,485
to break his fall.

175
00:12:21,605 --> 00:12:26,325
My client has absolutely no form
in this area,

176
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:31,565
whereas we all know Paddo's reputation
for receiving swollen goods.

177
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:35,485
Yes. Well, I reckon he's got you there.

178
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,325
My brethren?

179
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:40,725
Jury?

180
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:43,565
Fair enough. Case dismissed.

181
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:56,925
Out you get, son.

182
00:13:01,045 --> 00:13:03,245
And you, Your Honour.

183
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:11,045
Oh, fuck.

184
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,845
- What?
- It's Kirsty's nephew, Connor.

185
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:15,845
That's his sister's boy.
You met him, yeah?

186
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:18,605
Oh, yeah. He's an annoying little shit.

187
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:20,445
Oh, Jesus.

188
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:21,925
Jesus!

189
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:24,445
- Kirsty adores him, Cleave.
- So what?

190
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:27,045
So? So he knows about me and Kirsty.

191
00:13:27,165 --> 00:13:30,725
He used to come around the house all
the time. He had a key, for fuck's sake.

192
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:32,965
- There was one night when we were...
- What?

193
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:39,005
Col, you're not still
in contact with Kirsty, are you?

194
00:13:40,565 --> 00:13:42,725
- Oh, mate.
- Wouldn't you be,

195
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:45,045
if she was the love of your life?

196
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:47,805
You don't know what it's been like
for this last year,

197
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:49,725
not being able to see her face,
her smile.

198
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:52,325
She can't even visit.
If Georgie finds out...

199
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:55,805
- Well, they didn't kill me.
- Why would they? You were just a root.

200
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:57,285
Just a root, was 1?

201
00:13:57,405 --> 00:13:59,925
I think if you ask Kirsty,
you'll get a different opinion.

202
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:02,205
Everyone knows you were just a root,
mate.

203
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:04,725
I was intimate with her.
I won her heart.

204
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:08,165
When Connor busted us,
I was painting her toenails.

205
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:11,125
- Oh, fuck.
-'Oh, fuck' is right, mate.

206
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:18,765
Our Lord said, 'Let he who is
without sin cast the first stone.'

207
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:21,365
No-one here is without sin,

208
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:25,405
nor is anyone, for that matter,
on God's great earth.

209
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:29,285
Our salvation will come
from acknowledging that sin.

210
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:33,445
So when was the last time
you saw your aunty?

211
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:35,965
In court.

212
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:39,205
She was there
pretty much the whole trial.

213
00:14:39,325 --> 00:14:43,245
She was wearing a blue dress... low cut.

214
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:49,605
Hungry, are you, my boy?

215
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,565
Wouldn't mind a burger.

216
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:56,685
Burger it is, then. Patrice!

217
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:05,205
Alright there, Kieran?

218
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:08,325
First shower is a real chuckle,
isn't it?

219
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:11,205
You'll be right, Kieran.
You'll be right.

220
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:13,285
We're all friends in here,
Your Honour!

221
00:15:13,405 --> 00:15:15,085
Knock it off, you pricks!

222
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:19,205
- Look at the size of that!
- He's pissed himself!

223
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:23,685
Oh, come on, fellas.
Give the poor bastard a break.

224
00:15:23,805 --> 00:15:25,645
I said, knock it off!

225
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:30,565
Kieran!

226
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:41,645
Audition time on Aussies Gotta Sing.

227
00:15:44,325 --> 00:15:46,805
Your spirits will fly.

228
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:49,125
They may touch your heart.

229
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:51,245
Hey, pretty boy!

230
00:15:55,365 --> 00:16:01,005
But which one has what it takes
fo make it to the next round

231
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,285
of Aussies Gotta Sing?

232
00:16:04,285 --> 00:16:06,245
What's up, mate?

233
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,245
Slipped in the shower.

234
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:09,725
You what?

235
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,525
I slipped in the shower.

236
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:15,085
You slipped in the shower
with someone else?

237
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:16,685
What?

238
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:19,885
I knew you'd find someone
better than me.

239
00:16:20,005 --> 00:16:25,245
No! I didn't slip in the shower,
I slipped in the shower on some soap.

240
00:16:25,365 --> 00:16:27,845
Not fucking funny!

241
00:16:27,965 --> 00:16:30,405
Oh, mate. Mate, come here.

242
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:33,365
- Come here.
- What? What are you doing?

243
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:34,845
- Here.
- Malcolm!

244
00:16:34,965 --> 00:16:36,325
Watch your head.

245
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:38,645
I told you,
this is not going to happen.

246
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:41,445
Relax, Cleave! I know what I'm doing.

247
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:43,645
Oh, my God. Malcolm!

248
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:46,845
Just relax.

249
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,245
There may be a problem here.

250
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:53,445
L5, S1. This could be a prolapse.

251
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:54,925
Oh, God!

252
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:56,845
How does that feel, Cleave?
Is itin?

253
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:58,845
Shut up, you fucking dogs!

254
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:05,485
Just relax.
Just breathe in and breathe out.

255
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:11,925
How's that? Is that better, mate?

256
00:17:14,085 --> 00:17:16,245
Where did you learn to do that?

257
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:20,525
I spent the first seven years
in this cell with an osteopath.

258
00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:22,165
- Wow.
- Walter Bell.

259
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:25,525
He strangled his wife to death
with a necktie,

260
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:29,805
which was strange,
‘cause he had such big, strong hands.

261
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:33,765
Maybe this is what you should be doing
when you get out - massage.

262
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:36,965
I've been thinking, Cleave -
maybe I should stay.

263
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:39,205
It's the only way that makes any sense
for us.

264
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:40,845
What do you mean, 'us'?

265
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:43,405
And what are you talking about -
extend your stay?

266
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:45,205
It's not a hotel, mate.

267
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:49,325
Not a good one.
Average at best, by Sydney standards.

268
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:52,565
Come on, mate. You should never have
been in here in the first place.

269
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:54,645
You wouldn't have been
if I'd defended you.

270
00:17:54,765 --> 00:17:57,285
I know, mate. I know.

271
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:06,565
Mal. You've got every right to think of
the world beyond these walls

272
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:09,125
as a stinking pit of despair
and injustice,

273
00:18:09,245 --> 00:18:10,845
and to a certain extent, it is.

274
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:14,845
But there is also happiness
out there, mate.

275
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:18,245
I've spotted it on at least three
separate occasions.

276
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:23,085
You will find it, but you're going to
need to have a little faith in yourself,

277
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:26,725
and you're going to have to have
some courage.

278
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:29,685
Oh, fuck!

279
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:33,285
I want to sing, Cleave.
That's what I want to do.

280
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:34,765
Oh, Jesus.

281
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:38,325
I've never told another living soul,
but I want to sing.

282
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:40,325
Why didn't you just burst into song

283
00:18:40,445 --> 00:18:43,365
instead of shoving your tongue
down my throat?

284
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:46,605
I never thought anyone
would ever listen.

285
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,205
Mate...

286
00:18:49,205 --> 00:18:50,565
I'll listen.

287
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:54,805
People will listen, as long as
you make the effort to be heard.

288
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,605
OK? Live the dream.

289
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,485
Live the dream, my friend.

290
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:03,565
Visitor, Cleave.

291
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:09,045
Are you carrying, Fergie?

292
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:12,205
- Chocky, nuts?
- Sorry, Cleave.

293
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,165
Aunty Kirsty sends her love.

294
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:18,045
Are you seeing her today?

295
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:22,925
Nah. There's been a bit of a mix-up.
You and me should talk, son.

296
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:30,845
- Who are you seeing?
- Don't know.

297
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:33,405
- You don't know?
- Kirsty's coming.

298
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:36,405
She's bringing some bloke who's
going to pretend to be my mate,

299
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:38,285
- s0 Georgie doesn't find out.
- Oh, mate.

300
00:19:38,405 --> 00:19:40,245
Cleave, I get to see her, mate!

301
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:42,805
Do me a favour -
wait here, let me go in first.

302
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:45,205
I don't want her freaking out.

303
00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:12,645
George.

304
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:15,085
So good to see you, Kirsty.

305
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:16,605
Please, have a seat.

306
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:19,365
Yeah. Well,
I'm actually just here to see Connor.

307
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:24,605
You look wonderful.
The years have been very kind.

308
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:26,645
Connor sends his love.

309
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:29,085
- He's OK?
- Oh, he's fine, yeah.

310
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:31,365
He just got his times mixed up.

311
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:34,685
- Asked me to see you instead.
- Yeah, well...

312
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:40,485
Shame about Mick, but, well,
given he's no longer with us...

313
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:44,365
George, it's been 20 years.

314
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:50,365
Love is neither boarded
nor bound by time, Kirsty.

315
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:52,205
George, please.

316
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:54,925
- Where are you going?
- You don't really expect...

317
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,285
I've been waiting for this day
for 20 years.

318
00:20:57,405 --> 00:21:00,005
You're wasting your fucking time.
I want to see Connor.

319
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,965
- There's someone else again!
- Goodbye, George.

320
00:21:03,085 --> 00:21:04,965
Is there someone else?

321
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:10,325
It's not still him, is it?

322
00:21:10,445 --> 00:21:12,485
It can't still be him!

323
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:16,725
No, Georgie, it's not still me.
Is it, Kirsty?

324
00:21:19,205 --> 00:21:21,365
No, it's not still him.

325
00:21:25,165 --> 00:21:27,685
Then who is it?

326
00:21:32,765 --> 00:21:34,405
Talk to me, mate.

327
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:37,005
His blood will be mine!

328
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,485
Jesus!

329
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:41,885
Oh, yes. It's all good panto in here.

330
00:21:42,005 --> 00:21:44,005
Why are you limping?

331
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,925
I slipped in the shower.

332
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:47,405
Oh, Cleaver!

333
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:48,885
What is wrong with everybody?

334
00:21:49,005 --> 00:21:52,125
I slipped in the shower, OK?
On some soap.

335
00:21:55,125 --> 00:22:01,005
So, ah, I read the appeal books.
That looks pretty good.

336
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,045
Yeah, but we still don't have a date.

337
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:05,685
I thought they're supposed to know
by the end of the month?

338
00:22:05,805 --> 00:22:07,685
There's been some backlog, apparently.

339
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:11,205
Barney and I are worried that they might
be waiting for the right combination.

340
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:12,805
- Of what?
- Of judges.

341
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:16,285
So by 'the right combination'
you mean, 'the wrong combination.'

342
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:18,925
Hartford, Styles and Menzies
is what I'm hearing.

343
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:22,645
Hartford, Styles and Menzies? Oh, Jesus.

344
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:26,685
That's not a fucking appeal,
that's an inquisition.

345
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,365
We're not sure yet. OK?

346
00:22:29,485 --> 00:22:32,205
What about Bill Dempsey? He'd be fair.

347
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:35,885
I set him up
with a couple of weathergirls one time.

348
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:37,925
He's suddenly on sabbatical
in Cambridge.

349
00:22:38,045 --> 00:22:39,405
You're joking?

350
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,005
And I believe that Charlotte Georges
is in the frame

351
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:43,645
for the vacancy on the High Court.

352
00:22:43,765 --> 00:22:46,925
They'd put Charlotte Georges
on the High Court to keep me in prison?

353
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:50,365
They'd make her queen if it kept you
in prison for another 13 years.

354
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:51,845
Oh, my God.

355
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:53,845
I brought you in some food.

356
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:57,805
Did you get the duck?
I've been dreaming about duck.

357
00:22:57,925 --> 00:23:00,885
I can't bring you in meat,
you know that.

358
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:03,485
Just bring it in, goddammit!

359
00:23:03,605 --> 00:23:06,725
Georgie gets lobsters flown in
from Fiji.

360
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:09,845
He's got Patrice from La Belle Epoque
working as his personal chef.

361
00:23:09,965 --> 00:23:12,325
- The arsonist?
- He's not an...

362
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:14,765
Well, it was his own restaurant,

363
00:23:14,885 --> 00:23:17,685
and it's the only bloody thing
he's burned in his life.

364
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:19,485
Come on - what did you get?

365
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:23,725
Rice, muesli,
Vegemite and water crackers.

366
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:26,165
So nothing that had parents?

367
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:34,189
http://hiqve.com/

368
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:53,205
What?!

369
00:23:59,325 --> 00:24:01,485
Hey, Georgie.

370
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:05,765
I believe it's your birthday.
Many happy returns, mate.

371
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:08,885
You know when you're having
a really fucking crook day

372
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:11,605
and then you get a blinding headache,

373
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:14,805
but there's a part of you
that's sort of grateful for the pain

374
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:18,165
because you can't worry about
anything else?

375
00:24:18,285 --> 00:24:19,965
Strangely liberating.

376
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:24,965
Well, I was at that point of liberation,
you walking sack of shit,

377
00:24:25,085 --> 00:24:27,325
when you knocked on my door.

378
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:32,405
You've got to know I've wanted
to kill you since the day you got here.

379
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:36,565
Funny thing, I've enjoyed
the anticipation of killing you so much,

380
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,965
I haven't been able
to get around to doing it.

381
00:24:40,085 --> 00:24:44,365
There's something
I think you should know about Kirsty.

382
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:49,085
You know I've spent a lot of time
with her over the years.

383
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:53,285
So, you know, we got to be pretty close.

384
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:59,485
The truth is, and she's mentioned this
to me more than once,

385
00:24:59,605 --> 00:25:02,965
she's always regretted leaving you
for Mick.

386
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,285
Biggest mistake of her life,
she calls it.

387
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:06,765
Oh, bullshit!

388
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:11,325
Mate, she's just so fucking terrified
of hurting you again, mate.

389
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:14,565
That's why she seems so,
I don't know, distant.

390
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:16,605
She could never hurt me!

391
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:21,565
I think... I might be able
to put in a word,

392
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:23,765
get her to visit again.

393
00:25:24,765 --> 00:25:28,925
I'm having a bit of a birthday dinner
tonight.

394
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:31,405
You might want to join us.

395
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:35,285
Yeah. That'd be great.

396
00:25:35,405 --> 00:25:37,205
Nice work.

397
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:40,685
I think I might have
underestimated you, Col.

398
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:44,445
Maybe we should
start talking about a deal, hey?

399
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,685
What are you doing, mate?

400
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:55,405
It's fine.
They just needed a little trimming.

401
00:25:55,525 --> 00:25:59,405
- Are you serious?
- It may have got a bit out of control.

402
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,085
But I was just...

403
00:26:01,205 --> 00:26:04,925
You've got to understand,
I'm going insane with hunger here.

404
00:26:05,045 --> 00:26:08,845
I just trimmed off a little sliver,
just for a taste,

405
00:26:08,965 --> 00:26:12,365
then it looked kind of weird
against the other ones,

406
00:26:12,485 --> 00:26:14,285
so I sort of evened them up.

407
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:17,725
Then the knife slipped on the third one.
Fuck, he's got four anyway.

408
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:21,645
Yeah, but he ordered 200z rumps.
It's his birthday!

409
00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:24,525
I don't know.
Tell him they're eye fillets.

410
00:26:24,645 --> 00:26:27,365
It's a better cut anyway.
He'll never know.

411
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,485
I didn't order eye fillet,
I ordered rump.

412
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:35,405
This is disfigured rump, which is
exactly what you're about to be.

413
00:26:35,525 --> 00:26:38,085
We just delivered what we got, mate.

414
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:39,645
Bullshit!

415
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:42,485
Patrice, is that what you ordered?

416
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:43,965
No.

417
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:47,205
I've already given you one life,
Cleaver.

418
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:50,045
I don't recall giving anyone a second.

419
00:26:50,165 --> 00:26:51,965
This is my birthday.

420
00:26:52,085 --> 00:26:56,245
- Many happy returns.
- And someone has swiped my dinner.

421
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,525
Mate, it wasn't me, honestly!

422
00:26:58,645 --> 00:27:01,445
I swear,
I'm basically a vegan these days.

423
00:27:01,565 --> 00:27:05,405
I'm treating this whole prison thing
as a state-sanctioned detox.

424
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:06,925
It was on your watch.

425
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:11,845
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

426
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:13,325
No idea, mate, yeah.

427
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,685
There's only one prick
who'd have the balls,

428
00:27:15,805 --> 00:27:18,045
because he knows I can't touch him,

429
00:27:18,165 --> 00:27:23,245
because the fucking Justice Minister
is his daughter's godfather.

430
00:27:23,365 --> 00:27:24,845
Was it Cal?

431
00:27:27,325 --> 00:27:29,325
You know Cal. Was it him?

432
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:32,445
Yeah. Yeah, it could be.

433
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:39,165
All I can say is, that's how they were
when we found them.

434
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:42,765
Do you want me to sort him out for you,
Georgie?

435
00:27:43,805 --> 00:27:45,285
Yes.

436
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,605
You up for it, Col?

437
00:27:50,845 --> 00:27:53,245
You are with me, aren't you, mate?

438
00:27:53,365 --> 00:27:55,565
Yeah, of course, Georgie.

439
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:01,965
Oh, no. No!

440
00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:05,085
So you think you can
put one over on Georgie?

441
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:07,285
- No!
- Fucking dog!

442
00:28:07,405 --> 00:28:11,485
And on his fucking birthday too, eh?

443
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:17,285
What do you want, Connor?

444
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:20,645
Georgie said
I should come join the party.

445
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:24,325
Cleaver, get out.

446
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:27,325
Get the fuck out, you dog.

447
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:32,485
Hold on, mate.

448
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:35,205
I've been thinking about your offer,

449
00:28:35,325 --> 00:28:39,765
and I think you might need
to make it a little better now, eh?

450
00:28:59,845 --> 00:29:01,325
Cleaver!

451
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:13,605
Cleaver, good to see you.

452
00:29:13,725 --> 00:29:16,845
Roachie?
The music's a little bit too loud.

453
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,485
I love a good fugue.

454
00:29:18,605 --> 00:29:22,045
They can be a little baroque sometimes,
don't you reckon?

455
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:24,165
After you.

456
00:29:32,925 --> 00:29:34,685
Thank you, Watto.

457
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:40,645
Just wait outside for me, please.

458
00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:45,125
Mm.

459
00:29:45,245 --> 00:29:47,605
So, how're you travelling?

460
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:51,485
Well, it's a long and winding road, Cal.

461
00:29:51,605 --> 00:29:54,125
That has led you to my door.

462
00:29:55,765 --> 00:29:59,845
I hear Georgie gave you
a bit of a skinning.

463
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,965
What can I do for you, mate?

464
00:30:03,965 --> 00:30:08,525
Past few days, Georgie's been giving me
a bit of the stink eye.

465
00:30:08,645 --> 00:30:10,685
- How can you tell?
- I can tell.

466
00:30:10,805 --> 00:30:12,485
The man's a rageoholic.

467
00:30:12,605 --> 00:30:15,245
Now, as you will have observed,
over the course of last year,

468
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:17,925
Georgie and I have reached
a gentlemen's agreement,

469
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:23,005
and managed to leave each other in peace
and get on managing our own affairs.

470
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,485
I am aware.

471
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:27,285
I wouldn't want to see anything
threaten that agreement.

472
00:30:27,405 --> 00:30:29,685
It wouldn't be
in anyone's best interest,

473
00:30:29,805 --> 00:30:32,485
not with my parole hearing coming up.

474
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:35,565
The Parole Board does love
a little bit of repentance.

475
00:30:35,685 --> 00:30:40,565
Good thing I wrote that
in the guidelines, eh?

476
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:43,285
So, what I want to hear from you is

477
00:30:43,405 --> 00:30:46,885
if that psycho is
making some sort of move on me.

478
00:30:47,005 --> 00:30:48,685
I wouldn't know, Cal.

479
00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:53,445
Your appeal is coming up soon, isn't it?

480
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:55,685
I could get in touch with
my former colleague

481
00:30:55,805 --> 00:30:59,285
and very, very, good mate, the Justice
Minister, and see what he could do.

482
00:30:59,405 --> 00:31:03,005
I could call him
and make sure you get royally screwed,

483
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:06,245
maybe even an extended sentence,
get you sent to Goulburn.

484
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,925
Supermax! The rest of your sentence
would crawl by then.

485
00:31:10,045 --> 00:31:11,605
Why would Georgie tell me anything?

486
00:31:11,725 --> 00:31:14,805
I don't know, mate. That's your problem.

487
00:31:16,245 --> 00:31:18,125
Oh, Cleaver...

488
00:31:20,605 --> 00:31:23,725
..I have two porterhouses
in the freezer.

489
00:31:23,845 --> 00:31:26,605
If they are so much as
slightly seasoned,

490
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:30,005
you will never see the light of day
again,

491
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:32,765
I swear to my maker.

492
00:31:36,725 --> 00:31:38,205
Gents.

493
00:31:40,925 --> 00:31:42,405
God bless.

494
00:31:44,565 --> 00:31:46,165
Is he OK?

495
00:31:46,285 --> 00:31:48,525
Couldn't be better, mate.

496
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:55,445
Oh, yes. Swimming in stink eye.

497
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,605
Kieran!

498
00:32:08,245 --> 00:32:09,765
Mate, what did you do?

499
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:12,325
- What do you mean?
- Georgie Corella.

500
00:32:12,445 --> 00:32:14,325
Georgie Corella?

501
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:17,805
Don't look him in the eyes!

502
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:21,645
No, don't look down. Just act normal.

503
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:24,845
Normal.

504
00:32:24,965 --> 00:32:26,485
Normal! Yeah.

505
00:32:27,485 --> 00:32:30,285
Word is he's got
the serious shits with you.

506
00:32:30,405 --> 00:32:31,965
You must have said or done something.

507
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:34,485
Cleaver, I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

508
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:36,245
I never speak to the man.

509
00:32:36,365 --> 00:32:38,845
Once Georgie gets an idea in his head,
that's it.

510
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:42,925
You must have seen the way he was
giving you the stink eye then.

511
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,405
Me?

512
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:46,685
- Good luck, mate.
- Cleaver!

513
00:32:46,805 --> 00:32:48,405
Help me! Please, I beg you.

514
00:32:48,525 --> 00:32:50,645
Alright. Just...

515
00:32:50,765 --> 00:32:55,645
I tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm going to talk to Georgie for you.

516
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,765
He and I go back.

517
00:32:57,885 --> 00:33:01,365
- Thank you, Cleaver.
- Watch your back, mate.

518
00:33:11,645 --> 00:33:13,325
What was all that about?

519
00:33:13,445 --> 00:33:15,125
What was all what about?

520
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,365
You and His Holiness.

521
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:23,005
A man with an appeal coming up
would do just about anything

522
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:27,045
to make sure that appeal
goes the right way, won't he?

523
00:33:27,165 --> 00:33:31,245
Cal's going to make a move against me
with the Minister.

524
00:33:31,365 --> 00:33:33,045
What's he offering you?

525
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:36,605
Nothing. I don't think he's going to
make a move against you, Georgie.

526
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:44,125
You're not going to make a move
against him, are you?

527
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:53,445
You're a funny bugger sometimes.
I'll give you that, Cleave.

528
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:12,605
Listen. Mal, now, whatever I say,
just back me up, OK?

529
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:14,405
Always. You know that.

530
00:34:14,525 --> 00:34:17,165
OK. Don't touch! Don't do that.

531
00:34:17,285 --> 00:34:19,765
So, Kieran,

532
00:34:19,885 --> 00:34:24,365
I think I've managed
to talk Georgie down for the time being.

533
00:34:24,485 --> 00:34:28,605
The problem with Georgie is
he has wild mood swings.

534
00:34:28,725 --> 00:34:32,765
- Did he say what it was I did?
- That you gave him the stink eye.

535
00:34:32,885 --> 00:34:35,765
- How could I give him the stink eye?
- I don't know.

536
00:34:35,885 --> 00:34:38,005
I haven't stopped crying
since I came here.

537
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:39,485
I don't know.

538
00:34:39,605 --> 00:34:42,045
Now listen. This is Malcolm.

539
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:45,165
He's a mate of mine.
He's been in here 17 years.

540
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:47,485
Nobody fucks with Malcolm, OK?

541
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:52,485
He's going to be your shadow for
a while when we're out of the cells.

542
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:54,325
I'll have your back, mate.

543
00:34:54,445 --> 00:34:55,805
So to speak.

544
00:34:55,925 --> 00:34:58,685
If Georgie does
have one of his mood swings,

545
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,125
he'll think twice
if you've got Malcolm by your side.

546
00:35:01,245 --> 00:35:03,045
Thank you, Cleaver. Thank you, Malcolm.

547
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:05,725
No, that's fine, mate. That's fine.

548
00:35:05,845 --> 00:35:09,285
You two are going to get on
like a house on fire.

549
00:35:09,405 --> 00:35:10,805
The conversations!

550
00:35:10,925 --> 00:35:12,885
You do both like a show tune.

551
00:35:13,005 --> 00:35:15,925
You're partial to a bit of Puccini,
aren't you, Kieran?

552
00:35:16,045 --> 00:35:19,525
I don't know what to say.
If there's anything I can do...

553
00:35:19,645 --> 00:35:21,645
No, it's fine. Fine.

554
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:27,325
Actually, now that you mention it...

555
00:35:27,445 --> 00:35:30,445
Could we just have a moment?
Thanks, Mal.

556
00:35:30,565 --> 00:35:32,045
Um...

557
00:35:33,245 --> 00:35:37,205
..my appeal is coming up
in a couple of months

558
00:35:37,325 --> 00:35:43,325
and I did hear that they were thinking
about Hartford, Styles and Menzies.

559
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:46,165
- Oh, Christ.
- Yes. That was my reaction.

560
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:47,805
What could I do from in here?

561
00:35:47,925 --> 00:35:52,805
Well, you're thick with the Chief,
aren't you?

562
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:55,085
Yes, but maybe not so much now.

563
00:35:55,205 --> 00:35:59,365
Yes. It's going to be his choice
who's sitting, isn't it?

564
00:35:59,485 --> 00:36:00,845
Come on.

565
00:36:00,965 --> 00:36:04,165
Come on, mate.
Don't get all doe-eyed on me.

566
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:07,525
You were done for perjury
and corruption.

567
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:12,405
OK, fine. If you don't want to help...

568
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:14,845
No, no. Cleaver!

569
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,005
How can I get a message to him?

570
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,565
I can't call him.

571
00:36:19,685 --> 00:36:23,205
Well, is Margaret coming to visit
any time soon?

572
00:36:23,325 --> 00:36:24,965
Yes, tomorrow.

573
00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:26,885
Well, there we are.

574
00:36:27,005 --> 00:36:29,285
Trust me, mate,
this is how things get done in here.

575
00:36:29,405 --> 00:36:32,085
We look after each other, OK?

576
00:36:49,765 --> 00:36:52,445
So have you been to the actual opera?

577
00:37:04,845 --> 00:37:06,205
How's uni?

578
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:07,845
Fine.

579
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:10,525
And Tara, all good there?

580
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,005
Yeah, yeah.

581
00:37:12,125 --> 00:37:15,805
- We're thinking of going away together.
- Just to Bali.

582
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:18,485
- Just to Bali.
- Ah, beautiful.

583
00:37:18,605 --> 00:37:20,965
Remember when we went to Bali?

584
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:22,765
Of course.

585
00:37:22,885 --> 00:37:26,965
Yes. Your mother told me
she could ride a moped.

586
00:37:27,085 --> 00:37:28,925
She lied.

587
00:37:30,365 --> 00:37:31,885
How's Roger?

588
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:33,445
- He's fine.
- Is he?

589
00:37:33,565 --> 00:37:35,325
Yeah. He sends his best.

590
00:37:35,445 --> 00:37:37,925
Does he? Send him mine.

591
00:37:40,205 --> 00:37:42,925
Come on, mate.
Something must have happened out there.

592
00:37:43,045 --> 00:37:48,365
It's been two months. You know,
have you had your first bong yet?

593
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:51,845
Are you doing any nude work with Tara
that I need to know about?

594
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:53,525
- Nope.
- No?

595
00:37:53,645 --> 00:37:55,965
Just studying, then off to Bali.

596
00:37:56,085 --> 00:37:59,765
Right. Look, guys - I get it.
It's awkward.

597
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:01,245
I have mentioned previously,

598
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:04,765
I don't want you coming here if you're
doing it out of a sense of obligation.

599
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:08,405
- It doesn't do any of us...
- We like coming.

600
00:38:08,525 --> 00:38:13,365
I used to have to visit clients here.
Nobody likes coming here, alright?

601
00:38:13,485 --> 00:38:15,405
I'm settled and I'm coping.

602
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:19,965
Let's just skip the next visit
and I'll see you at the appeal.

603
00:38:20,085 --> 00:38:23,405
Are you sure you think the appeal
is a good idea?

604
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:25,005
What do you mean?

605
00:38:26,965 --> 00:38:29,565
I've read these studies,

606
00:38:29,685 --> 00:38:32,885
and a lot of people in your situation

607
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:38,405
can find the loss of an appeal more
devastating than the initial conviction

608
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,365
because they get a fresh taste
of freedom,

609
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,405
then they have to learn
to forget it again.

610
00:38:42,525 --> 00:38:46,125
Look, I'm feeling very bullish
about the appeal.

611
00:38:46,245 --> 00:38:47,965
You saw what a joke my trial was.

612
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:51,045
Scarlet thinks there's a problem.

613
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:53,765
Scarlet always thinks
there's a fucking problem!

614
00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:56,605
- It's the curse of her people.
- Cleave...

615
00:38:56,725 --> 00:38:58,885
Look, the appeal will be fine.

616
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:02,725
Just a little finessing of the bench
and off we go.

617
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:04,565
Finessing of the bench?

618
00:39:04,685 --> 00:39:06,525
What I do best.

619
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:09,885
Come on, team!

620
00:39:11,965 --> 00:39:13,685
A bit of faith, please.

621
00:39:15,285 --> 00:39:17,285
I'll see you at the appeal.

622
00:39:37,405 --> 00:39:39,205
I've got to go to the loo.

623
00:39:40,605 --> 00:39:42,645
Why are you telling me that?

624
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:46,205
I don't want you to worry.

625
00:39:54,805 --> 00:39:57,645
- Night, Kieran.
- Thank you, Cleaver.

626
00:39:57,765 --> 00:39:59,645
Night, mate. Sleep tight.

627
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:01,765
He seems like a good bloke.

628
00:40:01,885 --> 00:40:04,085
- Yeah.
- It's funny, isn't it?

629
00:40:04,205 --> 00:40:06,925
He's scared to be here,
I'm scared to be leaving.

630
00:40:07,045 --> 00:40:08,885
You won't know yourself, Mal.

631
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:11,405
That's just it, Cleave -
I won't know myself.

632
00:40:11,525 --> 00:40:14,085
I don't know what the fuck
I'm going to do.

633
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:16,885
Grow up and stop being
this whiny little fucking child!

634
00:40:17,005 --> 00:40:19,925
You're getting the one thing every man
in here wants - your freedom.

635
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:22,085
The way it looks at the moment,

636
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:25,245
I'm going to be in here
for another 13 years.

637
00:40:25,365 --> 00:40:27,205
I'm sorry, mate.

638
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:44,165
Get out of the way!

639
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:49,645
Move!

640
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:02,525
I have no idea what happened in there.

641
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:06,925
I barely knew Connor.
There was no interaction between us.

642
00:41:07,045 --> 00:41:09,725
It was movie night,
but you don't have to watch it.

643
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:12,485
You can come and go as you please.
It's not like Supermax.

644
00:41:12,605 --> 00:41:15,605
- Did the watch the whole movie?
- Fuck, yeah. It was a ripper.

645
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:18,445
Indeed. I sat through the whole thing.

646
00:41:18,565 --> 00:41:21,085
Poor Connor. He was a good boy.

647
00:41:21,205 --> 00:41:26,725
Lord, let us commend the spirit
of our friend, Connor Fitzgibbon,

648
00:41:26,845 --> 00:41:29,085
into your loving embrace.

649
00:41:29,205 --> 00:41:31,645
May you hold him and keep him.

650
00:41:31,765 --> 00:41:35,085
So you went for a piss
about halfway through?

651
00:41:35,205 --> 00:41:37,405
- Yeah.
- And then?

652
00:41:37,525 --> 00:41:40,645
Then I saw the stairs
going up to the court,

653
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:43,725
at least that's what we call
Georgie's compound.

654
00:41:43,845 --> 00:41:47,805
Then I saw a shadow.
I thought it must be Connor.

655
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:53,125
It was. I climbed up the stairs
and I picked up whatever I could find -

656
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:54,485
a chair.

657
00:41:54,605 --> 00:41:56,325
I just ran at him with it.

658
00:41:56,445 --> 00:41:59,445
- So you're saying you killed him?
- Yeah.

659
00:41:59,565 --> 00:42:01,445
Why?

660
00:42:01,565 --> 00:42:03,565
He was rude.

661
00:42:04,885 --> 00:42:07,245
I don't like rude people.

662
00:42:09,605 --> 00:42:12,005
You did not kill Connor.
I know you didn't.

663
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:13,845
- Yeah, I did.
- No, you didn't.

664
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:16,205
- Why?
- I told you, he was rude.

665
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:20,285
- No, mate. You're not a killer.
- You know I am, Cleave.

666
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,765
Malcolm, this is just about you

667
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:26,805
trying to find a way
to stay in this cesspit, isn't it?

668
00:42:26,925 --> 00:42:29,925
I'm prepared to do whatever time
the state sees fit.

669
00:42:30,045 --> 00:42:34,445
Have you given any thought to the fact
that the state, in its infinite wisdom,

670
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:37,845
might not want to send you back
to our cosy little hacienda?

671
00:42:37,965 --> 00:42:40,805
They might want to send you off
to Supermax. Did that occur to you?

672
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,765
Yeah. Why would they do that?
It's just another murder.

673
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:45,245
No, it's not.

674
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:48,485
You have confessed to the brutal killing
of someone.

675
00:42:48,605 --> 00:42:51,485
They're going to decide that
you're too dangerous for this place,

676
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:54,085
and they're going to send you
to fucking Goulburn,

677
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:56,365
if you make it to trial alive.

678
00:43:00,565 --> 00:43:02,165
Maybe I made a mistake.

679
00:43:02,285 --> 00:43:04,085
Do you reckon?

680
00:43:11,885 --> 00:43:13,805
What have you come as?

681
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:17,925
What have you come as?
Did you think it was fancy dress today?

682
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:21,725
Yeah? Come on, baby!
Put some skin on me, baby.

683
00:43:21,845 --> 00:43:24,965
What kind of a mid-life crisis
are we looking at here?

684
00:43:25,085 --> 00:43:28,325
It's not like you're about to appear
on the cover of Harper's any time soon.

685
00:43:28,445 --> 00:43:31,245
- Really?
- And I can go home and get changed.

686
00:43:31,365 --> 00:43:34,085
Can you? Maybe you should,
before you come in here.

687
00:43:34,205 --> 00:43:36,325
It was Sports Day at the school, mate.

688
00:43:36,445 --> 00:43:38,965
So you decided to wear a shirt saying,
'fo' yo mama'

689
00:43:39,085 --> 00:43:43,005
to your children's Sports Day
at that school? How did that go down?

690
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:45,325
What's wrong?
It's not like it's 'mofo.'

691
00:43:45,445 --> 00:43:47,365
- It is basically ‘mofo.'
- No, no.

692
00:43:47,485 --> 00:43:50,485
- It's "fo yo mama' - ‘for your mother.'
- 'For your mother?'

693
00:43:50,605 --> 00:43:52,085
It's sweet, isn't it?

694
00:43:52,205 --> 00:43:54,845
I don't know, baby.
You'd better ask your homies.

695
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:58,245
Mate, Malcolm bashed his father to death
with a phone.

696
00:43:58,365 --> 00:44:00,005
Yeah, but he didn't kill Connor.

697
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:01,605
I'm not saying he did or didn't.

698
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:05,005
I'm just saying, he's currently serving
a sentence for a violent murder.

699
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:07,685
He's admitted to committing
another violent murder,

700
00:44:07,805 --> 00:44:09,725
and he's given the police
a credible motive.

701
00:44:09,845 --> 00:44:13,085
He's just shit-scared
about getting out of here.

702
00:44:13,205 --> 00:44:15,885
He's never known any other life.
Come on, Barnyard.

703
00:44:16,005 --> 00:44:18,805
Hello!
Is there a lawyer in there somewhere?

704
00:44:18,925 --> 00:44:22,965
I'm talking about the evidence.
He's screwed, mate.

705
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:29,285
Mr Greene will no doubt tell you
what a good bloke Mal is.

706
00:44:29,405 --> 00:44:31,245
We all like him.

707
00:44:31,365 --> 00:44:34,205
That's what makes this case so hard.

708
00:44:34,325 --> 00:44:39,845
If we are to let brutal murderers off
just because they're good blokes,

709
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:44,485
my friends,
that is the first step towards anarchy.

710
00:44:44,605 --> 00:44:47,805
Make no mistake,
the defendant in this case

711
00:44:47,925 --> 00:44:50,885
is already a convicted murderer.

712
00:44:51,005 --> 00:44:52,605
A convicted murderer.

713
00:44:52,725 --> 00:44:56,565
The truth is, Malcolm did what he did
because he watched his father

714
00:44:56,685 --> 00:44:58,965
torture his mother for 18 years.

715
00:44:59,085 --> 00:45:00,445
He did what he did

716
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:04,605
because his father beat his mother
to death with a lamp.

717
00:45:04,725 --> 00:45:06,605
His father was acquitted.

718
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:09,565
Malcolm had no representation
when he spoke to the cops,

719
00:45:09,685 --> 00:45:13,685
and he met his counsel
15 minutes before the trial kicked off.

720
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:17,605
So my friend's attempt to characterise
the murders of the deceased

721
00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:22,525
and Malcolm's father as identical
in nature is patently absurd.

722
00:45:22,645 --> 00:45:27,325
Malcolm had no quarrel with Connor,
none whatsoever.

723
00:45:30,325 --> 00:45:32,925
There is someone, though, who did.

724
00:45:38,165 --> 00:45:39,925
You're calling me?

725
00:45:40,045 --> 00:45:44,645
You're not that fucking stupid.
You call me, you're a dead man.

726
00:45:44,765 --> 00:45:46,965
What happened, Col?

727
00:45:47,965 --> 00:45:49,325
Come on, the truth.

728
00:45:49,445 --> 00:45:51,485
Mal doesn't deserve to be cut

729
00:45:51,605 --> 00:45:55,005
and he doesn't deserve to spend
the rest of his life in Goulburn.

730
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:57,325
- What happened?
- I had to move fast.

731
00:45:57,445 --> 00:46:01,765
I had no choice. He was going to
sell me down the river, mate.

732
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:03,965
So who did it?

733
00:46:04,085 --> 00:46:06,005
Griffo.

734
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:08,125
Griffo. Double lifer.

735
00:46:08,245 --> 00:46:10,645
Yeah, so it's no skin off his nose.

736
00:46:10,765 --> 00:46:13,405
They've been giving him mum 25 grand
for the rest of her life

737
00:46:13,525 --> 00:46:17,165
just to keep him sweet,
50 grand if he takes the rap.

738
00:46:17,285 --> 00:46:21,045
- Will he take the rap?
- Yeah, if I give him the word.

739
00:46:21,165 --> 00:46:24,685
I'd like to call Griffo, Your Lordship.

740
00:46:35,845 --> 00:46:38,085
Griffo.

741
00:46:38,205 --> 00:46:39,565
Cleave.

742
00:46:39,685 --> 00:46:41,565
Did you do it, mate?

743
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:49,205
- Yeah.
- Prepared to tell the cops?

744
00:46:52,605 --> 00:46:54,805
Yeah.

745
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:58,045
Well, I reckon that just about
does it, eh?

746
00:46:58,165 --> 00:47:03,405
If only the wheels of justice would turn
this efficiently in the outside world.

747
00:47:03,525 --> 00:47:06,125
Get off me. Not in front of the boys.

748
00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:17,645
- You came.
- Yeah.

749
00:47:17,765 --> 00:47:20,725
A girl can only withstand so much.

750
00:47:23,205 --> 00:47:24,605
Sorry about Connor.

751
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:28,885
Oh, well, yeah. It's a tragedy,

752
00:47:29,005 --> 00:47:32,765
but at least you've got a friend in here
in Col.

753
00:47:34,205 --> 00:47:35,565
Col?

754
00:47:35,685 --> 00:47:37,725
Georgie?

755
00:47:37,845 --> 00:47:41,605
You'll never know loyalty like his.
Trust me.

756
00:47:43,165 --> 00:47:44,645
Of course I do.

757
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:50,405
Yeah, fine. I understand. Right.

758
00:47:52,165 --> 00:47:56,085
Sorry, Cleave.
The Chief said it was a no-go. Too hot.

759
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:59,645
How can it be too hot?
They're all judges, aren't they?

760
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:03,685
It's not like I'm asking them
to put a crack dealer on the bench,

761
00:48:03,805 --> 00:48:05,485
I just want it to be fair.

762
00:48:05,605 --> 00:48:07,885
Hartford by himself, fine.

763
00:48:08,005 --> 00:48:12,605
But Hartford, Menzies and Styles,
are you fucking kidding me?

764
00:48:12,725 --> 00:48:15,005
Styles gave evidence against me.

765
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,485
Yeah, there you go.

766
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:18,125
Fucking hypocrite.

767
00:48:37,085 --> 00:48:38,565
Hello, stranger.

768
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:47,205
I thought you weren't going to be back
for a couple of months.

769
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:49,205
Just a quick press junket.

770
00:48:49,325 --> 00:48:50,725
Oh, yeah. So is it all done now?

771
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,885
Almost.

772
00:48:53,005 --> 00:48:54,445
- Potsy happy?
- Richie.

773
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:55,925
Richie.

774
00:48:56,045 --> 00:48:59,045
What was the budget again?

775
00:48:59,165 --> 00:49:00,805
70 million.

776
00:49:07,405 --> 00:49:09,445
So how's the appeal coming?

777
00:49:12,125 --> 00:49:15,245
You know I can
afford a truckload of silks.

778
00:49:15,365 --> 00:49:19,325
No, Barney and Scarlet are handling it.
That's as it should be.

779
00:49:20,685 --> 00:49:23,645
I had a drink with your archenemy
last night.

780
00:49:25,085 --> 00:49:28,045
I've gathered so many over recent years.

781
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:33,085
- David.
- David, of the Harry-sorry clan?

782
00:49:33,205 --> 00:49:34,885
- Mm.
- Sad family.

783
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:37,245
A bit of inbreeding there, I think.

784
00:49:37,365 --> 00:49:40,325
Have you noticed how his eyes
don't quite line up?

785
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:43,045
Do you want to have a conversation
or deflect one?

786
00:49:45,325 --> 00:49:50,525
At least you seem free to talk,
so that's a good thing.

787
00:49:50,645 --> 00:49:53,485
Everybody else is so fucking stilted.

788
00:49:56,005 --> 00:49:58,525
I did a quick mental calculation
the other day.

789
00:49:58,645 --> 00:50:01,805
I added up all the crimes I actually
have committed,

790
00:50:01,925 --> 00:50:03,925
as opposed to this one,
that I didn't commit.

791
00:50:04,045 --> 00:50:08,325
In terms of sentencing, it sort
of balances out, you know what I mean?

792
00:50:08,445 --> 00:50:14,965
So what I was thinking was,
if the appeal doesn't get up,

793
00:50:15,085 --> 00:50:19,605
I really don't want you coming here.

794
00:50:20,605 --> 00:50:22,085
Yeah. Yeah, right.

795
00:50:22,205 --> 00:50:24,365
I'm serious.

796
00:50:24,485 --> 00:50:25,965
What? You don't want visitors?

797
00:50:26,085 --> 00:50:28,525
No, I don't want you visiting me.

798
00:50:29,845 --> 00:50:32,725
You remind me of freedom,

799
00:50:32,845 --> 00:50:38,765
and I don't want to have to
learn to forget it every time I see you.

800
00:50:41,165 --> 00:50:43,605
Do you understand what I mean?

801
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:14,885
Come on, mate.

802
00:52:26,405 --> 00:52:30,565
I thought you had to be married
to get one of these.

803
00:52:30,685 --> 00:52:32,165
I have friends.

804
00:52:32,285 --> 00:52:36,925
Anyway, in my heart,
we've always been married.

805
00:53:04,325 --> 00:53:06,925
Your trial was a bloody travesty,
Cleaver.

806
00:53:07,045 --> 00:53:08,605
I know.

807
00:53:08,725 --> 00:53:13,565
I'd be having the DPP look into this
if it wasn't one of the main culprits.

808
00:53:14,725 --> 00:53:17,405
I'm still screwed, aren't I?

809
00:53:17,525 --> 00:53:19,365
It's basically Styles.

810
00:53:19,485 --> 00:53:23,565
Whatever way he goes,
he's going to bully the other two.

811
00:53:23,685 --> 00:53:25,925
That's how it usually happens.

812
00:53:26,045 --> 00:53:28,365
Why did you call him a hypocrite?

813
00:53:28,485 --> 00:53:30,165
- What?
- The other day.

814
00:53:30,285 --> 00:53:32,925
You said Styles was a hypocrite.

815
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:37,245
There may be a way around this.

816
00:53:38,845 --> 00:53:40,485
What?

817
00:53:40,605 --> 00:53:43,245
You know this Cadamaya bullshit?

818
00:53:43,365 --> 00:53:46,085
It's bullshit because you got busted.

819
00:53:46,205 --> 00:53:48,565
- It's nothing.
- What do you mean, it's nothing?

820
00:53:48,685 --> 00:53:50,325
There's another deal.

821
00:53:50,445 --> 00:53:52,005
It's out there as we speak,

822
00:53:52,125 --> 00:53:56,485
and it's about fifty times bigger
and more rotten than Cadamaya.

823
00:53:56,605 --> 00:53:59,925
- What is it?
- Bearbung, Cleaver.

824
00:54:00,045 --> 00:54:01,525
Bearbung.

825
00:54:07,685 --> 00:54:09,165
Bearbung?

826
00:54:10,765 --> 00:54:12,245
Talk to me, Kieran.
