1
00:00:57,165 --> 00:00:59,205
Kerri, the chapel
was overflowing with mourners

2
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:00,925
here to farewell Joshua Floyd,

3
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:04,565
slain founder of the leaks site
good _plumbing.com.

4
00:01:04,725 --> 00:01:07,005
Chief amongst them, of course,
was Floyd's fiancée,

5
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:09,285
author and ex-prostitute
JM Doolan,

6
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:12,525
who is out on bail, having been charged
with Floyd's murder.

7
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:14,805
She refuses
to speak to media herself

8
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:17,285
but her barrister,
human rights advocate Cleaver Greene,

9
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,245
did speak to assembled media.

10
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:24,085
Nothing has been laid to rest today,
not by a long stretch.

11
00:01:24,245 --> 00:01:26,005
Josh's work will continue.

12
00:01:26,165 --> 00:01:28,485
Those who sought to end

13
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:32,445
his quest for justice,
truth and democracy,

14
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:34,525
the despots who murdered him,

15
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:37,245
who literally
stabbed him in the back,

16
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:42,125
those bastards who now point their
fingers at the woman who loved him,

17
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:45,605
they will be brought to justice.

18
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:47,805
This I promise you.

19
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:49,925
Mr Greene.
One more question, Mr Greene.

20
00:01:50,085 --> 00:01:52,245
Oh, Mum. You can't be serious?

21
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:54,085
He's milking it for everything
it's bloody worth.

22
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:55,605
What are you saying?

23
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:57,165
I'm saying
Dad's finally in the papers

24
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,885
without the word ‘allegedly'
near his name

25
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:00,565
and he wants to keep it that way.

26
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:04,645
Fuzz, I haven't seen your father
like this...for 15 years.

27
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:07,445
I mean, he might have finally
found a cause

28
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:09,285
that's actually worth fighting for.

29
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,525
You're not thinking
what I think you're thinking?

30
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:13,965
Well, it's the dream of every child

31
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,725
from a broken home that, one day,
that home be rebuilt.

32
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:19,485
Yeah, when I was four, maybe.

33
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:23,325
Five at a stretch. But by the time
I reached six, all I felt was relief.

34
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:24,805
I beg your pardon?

35
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:27,885
You and Dad don't function together,
Mum. It's like a law of science.

36
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:29,525
The quality of your relationship

37
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:31,765
is in inverse proportion
to its geographic proximity.

38
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,245
Meaning?

39
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:34,925
The further you are
physically apart,

40
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:36,485
the better you function together.

41
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:38,125
Don't be absurd.

42
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:42,405
You know, Josh could have
been a little less cryptic.

43
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:44,085
“There's this German.”

44
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:47,605
Yes, there's actually
82 million of the fuckers.

45
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:49,245
“There's this password.”

46
00:02:49,405 --> 00:02:51,365
Yes, well, which German
does it belong to?

47
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:53,765
Did he introduce you
to any Germans?

48
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:56,485
Missy?

49
00:02:56,645 --> 00:02:58,125
Miss?

50
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:06,005
OK, you're absolutely sure
that no-one saw you?

51
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:10,405
I told you. I was doing laps.
I mean, who'd notice?

52
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,405
From the time you left the hotel room
until the time you got back,

53
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:16,365
you didn't speak to a single soul?

54
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:17,885
I was doing laps.
OK.

55
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,845
Want something to eat?

56
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:23,765
Drink? Ho

57
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:26,685
Why not? Drink drink?

58
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:28,485
Without something to eat?

59
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:30,685
Listen, sweetheart,
if you don't eat something soon,

60
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:33,725
your stomach's gonna start
eating itself, alright?

61
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:35,885
It's kill or be killed down there.

62
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:37,485
I know these things.

63
00:03:37,645 --> 00:03:40,405
I once defended a gastroenterologist
on Medicare fraud.

64
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:42,805
Oh, no.

65
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:44,285
What?

66
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:46,845
An old client of mine.

67
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:52,365
“The coroner dismissed
earlier reports

68
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:55,565
“that Dr Chambers had died
as a result of natural causes

69
00:03:55,725 --> 00:04:00,205
“and found that the well-respected
oncologist had committed suicide.”

70
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,685
He was a chapter
in my book, Cleave.

71
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:12,485
Are you OK?

72
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:16,085
Yeah.

73
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:21,325
Argh!

74
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:41,285
Oh, fuck! FUCK! Scarlet.

75
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:49,085
Dr Robinson to
Intensive Care, please. Dr Robinson?

76
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:51,085
Scarlet?
How is he?

77
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:53,045
Oh, he'll be fine.
It was a clean break.

78
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:55,485
OK.

79
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:02,365
Oh, baby.

80
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:07,285
Oh. I can take you home
in a couple of hours.

81
00:06:07,445 --> 00:06:09,125
You're gonna be fine.

82
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,645
The doctor said it's a clean break.

83
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,685
Clean break, you say?
Yeah.

84
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:17,245
Yeah.
OK.

85
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:20,525
If that's what you want.

86
00:06:20,685 --> 00:06:25,005
No, Barney. Your arm.

87
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:26,485
It's a clean break.

88
00:06:26,645 --> 00:06:29,045
You know, I wanted us to work.

89
00:06:31,245 --> 00:06:32,685
For us.

90
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:37,205
For the kids.
Oh, darling.

91
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:39,725
Hey, don't worry about me.

92
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:43,605
Hm. I've met someone.

93
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:48,485
Did you just say you've met someone?

94
00:06:48,645 --> 00:06:50,365
Whoa!

95
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,485
Barney?

96
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:56,205
Barney?

97
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:05,405
Oh, private numbers shit me.

98
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,205
Hello.

99
00:07:08,365 --> 00:07:09,685
Cleaver Greene?

100
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:12,325
Yes. Who's this?
We need to talk.

101
00:07:12,485 --> 00:07:16,365
Look, if this is in relation to
a so-called personal banking matter,

102
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:18,725
this is bordering on harassment, mate.

103
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:21,565
I need to talk to you
about Joshua Floyd.

104
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:24,405
But not over the phone.

105
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:14,965
Is this for real?

106
00:08:16,325 --> 00:08:18,005
I mean, ‘cause if itis...

107
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,765
Having trouble finding the German,
Mr Greene?

108
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:24,445
You're close, Mr Greene.

109
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,125
Closer than you think.

110
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:30,725
The girl is innocent.
She's been set up.

111
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,645
Yeah, I know that much.

112
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,725
We want to help you.

113
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:36,925
But we have to be careful.

114
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:41,645
You'll be dealing with
many, many interested parties.

115
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:44,885
Including your own government.

116
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:47,365
ASIO?

117
00:08:48,565 --> 00:08:50,125
They'll block you at every turn.

118
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:54,445
Josh said, um,
that he had enough information

119
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:57,125
to bring down three governments
and Wall Street.

120
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:59,685
As they say in the classics,

121
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:02,365
just follow the money.

122
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:06,165
How do I get in touch with you?

123
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:08,805
You don't.
I'll be in touch with you.

124
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,125
Of course. Silly me.

125
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,365
Be careful.

126
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:16,605
Don't trust your email
or your phones from now on.

127
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,525
They're compromised.
Do you understand?

128
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:29,165
What's the matter?
Yeah, no, it's fine.

129
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:32,045
I just thought you might not be here.

130
00:09:33,685 --> 00:09:35,685
Yeah, yep.
With him now. I gotta go.

131
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:39,205
And I'll get back to you. Yep, OK.
New numbers are in.

132
00:09:39,365 --> 00:09:42,605
Oh, yeah? Don't tell me we've made it
to double digits at last?

133
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:45,085
Ha! The party hasn't, but you have.
What?

134
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:46,565
Well into double digits, mate.

135
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:49,685
Bloody streets ahead of our beloved
leader, Captain Capitulate.

136
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:51,365
Shit.

137
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,685
Yeah, Bruce was wondering
if you wanted to have a chat.

138
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:56,285
What about?
About duck hunting, you dick.

139
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:58,405
About becoming the next
leader of the opposition.

140
00:09:58,565 --> 00:09:59,885
It's too soon.

141
00:10:00,045 --> 00:10:01,365
He's not talking tomorrow,

142
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:04,605
he's talking deep, strategic,
long-term political planning.

143
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:07,005
Yeah, so probably
nothing before next week.

144
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:13,565
This is unbelievable.

145
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:15,045
I mean, who isn't involved?

146
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:16,805
How does someone subpoena
the CIA?

147
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:18,805
Buggered if I know.

148
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,565
Where do you reckon
it's gonna land?

149
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:22,485
What do you mean?

150
00:10:22,645 --> 00:10:24,885
Well, this is all
very, very sexy stuff,

151
00:10:25,045 --> 00:10:27,565
but there's nothing I've seen yet
that will actually help Missy.

152
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:29,965
Oh, it will. Just keep looking.

153
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,645
Follow the money.

154
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,805
Hey, have you hurt your arm?

155
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:37,365
Morning.
Nicole.

156
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:38,845
Morning.

157
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,325
Now, listen, could you scare us up

158
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:42,445
a couple of coffees
and a whiteboard, please?

159
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:45,405
A white...a whiteboard? You want
a whiteboard? What's going on?

160
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:46,885
Oh, nothing.

161
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:49,085
Just trying to save the world.

162
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:53,045
Hi, mate.

163
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:54,805
Yes.

164
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:59,165
I... Yes. Yes!

165
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,725
OK.

166
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:03,605
Fuck! Nicole?

167
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:09,725
OK, I have a conference.
Could you please print this out for me?

168
00:11:09,885 --> 00:11:11,645
Before coffees
and saving the world?

169
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,645
You don't get to save the world.
No, of course not.

170
00:11:14,805 --> 00:11:16,925
How could I without a whiteboard?

171
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:22,805
What happened to your arm?

172
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:25,365
Just a fall. You OK?

173
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:27,165
Yeah. Yep, yep. You?

174
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:29,125
I'm fine.
Good.

175
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:31,365
So we're good then?
Yep.

176
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,845
Good.

177
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:35,565
Did you wanna talk about...?
Nope.

178
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:42,445
Col.

179
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:46,765
What's up?
Kirsty's not happy, Cleave.

180
00:11:46,925 --> 00:11:49,365
Oh, fuck. Is that what
you called me here for?

181
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:52,485
You haven't seen her in almost a week.
You barely return half her calls.

182
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,925
Mate, I am up to my bottom lip
in it right now.

183
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:57,445
You know that. So does she.

184
00:11:57,605 --> 00:11:59,925
Yeah, be that as it may,
she's not happy, mate.

185
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:01,405
Well...

186
00:12:01,565 --> 00:12:05,645
Welcome to the wonderful world
of interpersonal relationships, Col.

187
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:08,885
I mean seriously fucking
not happy, Cleave.

188
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:10,805
I'm worried about her.

189
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:14,125
I think she might be depressed.

190
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:16,205
She needs you, Cleave.

191
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:19,685
Mate, she doesn't need me.
You know that.

192
00:12:19,845 --> 00:12:23,685
Yeah. Yeah, I do,
and it makes me want to puke.

193
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,605
Col?

194
00:12:27,965 --> 00:12:30,165
Oh. Fuck.

195
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:34,045
Me, please.
Max, you drink too much.

196
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:36,605
You take that very slowly, alright?

197
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:38,405
Two. Two. Two.
One is enough.

198
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:39,925
Two, two, two, two.
One.

199
00:12:40,085 --> 00:12:42,205
Three, three, three.
One, one, one, one.

200
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:54,845
You alright?

201
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:04,245
When we were at the hospital, you...
Yeah?

202
00:13:04,405 --> 00:13:06,805
You told me
that you'd met someone.

203
00:13:06,965 --> 00:13:08,365
I what?

204
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:11,125
You said that you'd met someone.

205
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:13,965
And you were out of it but...

206
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:18,085
..somehow it rang true so...

207
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,405
..I was wondering...

208
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:25,365
..have you met someone?

209
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,445
It was a one-off.

210
00:13:37,605 --> 00:13:39,605
It won't come to anything.

211
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:54,285
You've slept with her?

212
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:04,005
Yeah.
Mm.

213
00:14:06,365 --> 00:14:08,045
Oh, look, Steve, I'd be interested

214
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:09,565
in knowing the Opposition's view

215
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:12,045
on extending licensed
brothel facilities in Sydney,

216
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:14,485
particularly David Potter's view,

217
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,765
given the fact he was engaged
fo a prostitute.

218
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,645
I'd welcome his expertise.

219
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:21,685
What the fuck was that about?

220
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:23,765
Oh, David...
He wants to throw that sort of shit?

221
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:25,405
Because if he wants
to make it personal,

222
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,685
I will rain a shit storm
down on you guys.

223
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:36,365
Are you OK?

224
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:47,685
I don't have much on this afternoon.
How about you?

225
00:14:48,725 --> 00:14:50,565
Scarlet, what's wrong?

226
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:54,525
I don't wanna talk about it.

227
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,085
Is it Cal?

228
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:58,325
‘Cause, you know,
I've been thinking...

229
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,365
Oh, have you really?

230
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:05,045
This may sound a little crazy
but, um...

231
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,645
Why don't you come and work for me?

232
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:14,525
You're not in government, Dave,
and you won't be for a thousand years.

233
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:16,645
And I'm where the power is.

234
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:19,605
You're just drifting
on the sidelines.

235
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:22,005
Political flotsam and jetsam.

236
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:23,925
We'll be back.

237
00:15:24,085 --> 00:15:27,685
Hm. Booked the exorcist, have you?

238
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:01,605
This isn't a very good idea, is it?

239
00:16:01,765 --> 00:16:04,085
No. It isn't.

240
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:15,085
Your Honour, the US State
and Justice Department,

241
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:18,565
the CIA, MI6, ASIO,

242
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:21,565
even the German Secret Service.

243
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:25,925
This is the biggest fishing expedition
that I have ever seen.

244
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,765
Your Honour,
this is purely a domestic matter

245
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:31,405
in every sense of the word.

246
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:34,565
And, Your Honour,
we renew our strong objection

247
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:36,165
to the defendant's motion

248
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:39,485
to subpoena all or any
of these parties.

249
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,685
Mr Greene?

250
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:43,725
Ah, Your Honour,

251
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:47,245
a raft of conservative
politicians and commentators

252
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:48,725
have gone on the record

253
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:51,725
stating that Joshua Floyd
should be put to death

254
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,085
for releasing classified information.

255
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:59,125
This is not just some wild conspiracy
theory I'm proffering here.

256
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:02,365
There are very serious and legitimate
questions being raised

257
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:04,485
about the murder of which
my client stands accused.

258
00:17:04,645 --> 00:17:09,165
Surely she has the right to have
any credible alternative theory

259
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:11,285
properly ventilated before a jury.

260
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:13,325
Mr Greene,
I know you've already danced

261
00:17:13,485 --> 00:17:15,285
around this maypole a few times,

262
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:18,365
so you'd be more than aware
that if I were to grant leave,

263
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:22,365
this court has no coercive powers
over any US government agency.

264
00:17:22,525 --> 00:17:24,245
They may simply just refuse.

265
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:25,965
In which case, Your Honour,

266
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,405
we would then be able to take
the matter up on appeal

267
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:31,165
at the International Court of Justice
in the calamitous event

268
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:34,045
that my client were to be found guilty
in this jurisdiction.

269
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:37,045
Very well. I'll reserve my decision.

270
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:42,525
What gives? Must be 15 years
since you dropped in on me at work.

271
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:46,205
Well, it's probably 15 years since
you had a case that I cared about.

272
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:49,805
You must be working crazy hours.

273
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:51,445
I don't mind.

274
00:17:52,925 --> 00:17:55,445
If you ever need a break or, you know,
some sustenance or anything,

275
00:17:55,605 --> 00:17:57,485
you can always come to us, you know.

276
00:17:57,645 --> 00:18:00,085
I mean, I'd love to help if I could.

277
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,365
Or if it's easier,
I could meet you somewhere.

278
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:04,925
I mean...

279
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,245
That might be easier.

280
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:09,045
OK.

281
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:12,605
Let me know.

282
00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:14,445
I will.

283
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:19,045
Oh, jeez. Oh. I've gotta go.

284
00:18:19,205 --> 00:18:20,685
Um...

285
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:24,725
See you, Cleave.
See you, Doc.

286
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:37,285
Are you home, darling?
In here.

287
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,565
How was your day?

288
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:43,085
An unrelenting stream
of pointlessness.

289
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,045
How was yours?

290
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:49,325
Yeah, it was fine. I just, um,
met Audrey in town for lunch.

291
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:50,805
Town, huh?

292
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:55,325
Yeah, town. It's a place
where people congregate.

293
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:57,765
It's got a couple of malls,
so you'd probably like it.

294
00:18:57,925 --> 00:19:00,405
You didn't happen to
bump into Dad by any chance?

295
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:03,085
Uh, funny you should mention that,

296
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:05,285
because I was actually
passing by the Supreme Court...

297
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,525
Oh, you didn't.
It was on my way to the car.

298
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:09,005
Mum, you're unbelievable.

299
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:10,645
Could you get that, please?

300
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:15,245
Finnegan.

301
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,365
Roger. Roger, I'm sorry, please.
I didn't mean anything by it.

302
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:19,925
Finnegan, just...
Please. Mum!

303
00:19:20,085 --> 00:19:22,365
I'm sorry, Roger. Mum.
Roger, Roger. He's just a boy.

304
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:24,605
Please, he did not understand
what he was doing with Sally.

305
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:26,725
He wanted to do the right thing.
He got carried...

306
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:29,165
Wendy. It's OK. Yeah?

307
00:19:29,325 --> 00:19:31,325
It's OK.

308
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:33,445
Oh, I'm just here
to look after the boys.

309
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,365
Sally is gonna stay
in Byron for a while.

310
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:37,845
Oh.

311
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:40,325
I promise,
I didn't mean to scare him.

312
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:43,765
Oh, that's fine. The little bugger
could use the occasional fright.

313
00:19:43,925 --> 00:19:46,645
Nothing I say seems to make
any difference.

314
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:50,605
How is Sally?

315
00:19:50,765 --> 00:19:53,845
Oh, she's finding herself.
Oh.

316
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:59,085
Notice how people never go looking
for themselves in cold climates?

317
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:04,485
You know, I...
I owe you an apology.

318
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:06,325
Really?

319
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:08,525
Sally told me that you were the one

320
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:10,685
who was having the affair,
and I believed her.

321
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:13,125
You don't know me that well,
so why wouldn't you believe her?

322
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:14,685
Oh, I'm supposed to be a shrink.

323
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:16,725
I can't believe I sat there
for hours on end

324
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:18,765
listening to her carry on,
and it was all bullshit.

325
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:21,125
Well, she has a few issues, our Sal.

326
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:23,605
Did you ever suspect?

327
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,125
She was having an affair?
Mm.

328
00:20:25,285 --> 00:20:26,805
Wasn't the first time.
Really?

329
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:28,925
But I had no idea
that it was Finnegan.

330
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:30,405
Oh.

331
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:32,165
For a while there,
I thought it was Cleaver.

332
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:34,765
Cleaver, you know,
he was always a bit flirty with her.

333
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:37,525
That's just his default setting.

334
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:45,549
http://hiqve.com/

335
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:07,645
Barnyard.

336
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:09,965
Yeah, I just finished reading
the prosecution's report.

337
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,445
And?

338
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,485
It's not good.
What is it?

339
00:21:14,645 --> 00:21:17,285
Not over the phone, mate.
OK. Look, I'm starving.

340
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:19,485
I'll see you at the Pic.
Yeah, OK.

341
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:22,965
This just came for you.

342
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,845
And I've got that dinner at eight.

343
00:21:26,005 --> 00:21:28,285
Ah, yes. Bevan's mum's birthday.

344
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:30,485
Yes.

345
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:32,565
And you called him Bevan. Hm.

346
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,685
Yeah. Give him my very best, alright?

347
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:37,365
Alright. I will.

348
00:21:37,525 --> 00:21:40,205
We should get together sometime.

349
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,925
You wanna get together with Bevan?

350
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:46,485
Yeah. Well, you know,
big day's coming.

351
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:49,005
Getting excited about the frocks.

352
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:54,205
Seriously, though,
I gotta take my hat off to you.

353
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:56,205
To the both of you, really.

354
00:21:56,365 --> 00:21:57,685
Why?

355
00:21:57,845 --> 00:22:00,405
Well, I know I've given you
some stick along the way

356
00:22:00,565 --> 00:22:03,805
about being a one-guy gal
since you were 15

357
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:07,645
but, here you are,
seconds from wedlock,

358
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:13,045
and you are looking sexier
and more womanly than ever.

359
00:22:13,205 --> 00:22:15,525
Really?
Yeah.

360
00:22:15,685 --> 00:22:18,485
I can see the tiger in your tank
all of a sudden.

361
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:21,485
The tiger in my tank? Since when?
I don't know.

362
00:22:21,645 --> 00:22:23,805
Just like the last week or something.

363
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:25,885
It's fantastic.

364
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:28,805
It's a lesson for
all the romantics out there.

365
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:32,325
You can tell all the old cynics like me
to bugger off,

366
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:35,405
because you have maintained
your faith

367
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:39,085
not only in your relationship
but also in yourself.

368
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:42,245
And you're clearly
more in love than ever.

369
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:45,365
What?

370
00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:47,925
What is it?

371
00:22:48,085 --> 00:22:49,565
What did I...?

372
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:51,445
What did I say?

373
00:22:53,725 --> 00:22:55,245
What did I say?

374
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:56,885
Fuck.

375
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:19,445
Taxi. Taxi.

376
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:21,925
Taxi. Taxi.

377
00:23:28,805 --> 00:23:31,005
Hey.
Hey.

378
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:33,805
Oh, don't get up.

379
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:35,485
How are you doing?

380
00:23:35,645 --> 00:23:38,285
Oh. You know...

381
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:40,365
Cleaver says I have to eat.

382
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:42,325
You should.
Melissa.

383
00:23:42,485 --> 00:23:44,325
Do you mind if I join you?

384
00:23:44,485 --> 00:23:46,805
No, no. Not at all.

385
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:52,445
Um, can I get you anything?
Some food?

386
00:23:57,765 --> 00:23:59,685
So, any developments?

387
00:23:59,845 --> 00:24:01,605
Nothing all that earth-shattering.

388
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:04,805
What's in the report?

389
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:06,565
Which report?

390
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:09,645
The one next to you marked ‘Floyd'.

391
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:13,005
Barney.

392
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:23,845
You're late.

393
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,805
Yeah, well, this is not exactly

394
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,045
the most convenient meeting place
in the world, is it, mate?

395
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:30,445
I mean, I realise you're angling
for a certain aesthetic here...

396
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:31,925
Mr Greene.

397
00:24:32,085 --> 00:24:33,605
Christ knows
how I'm gonna get a cab.

398
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:36,485
My associates are keen
to know if you're making progress.

399
00:24:36,645 --> 00:24:40,005
Well... I'm following
the money, alright?

400
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:42,365
But it's not exactly
leading me anywhere.

401
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:44,845
You do realise this is
probably the only opportunity

402
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:47,245
we'll have
to get them in a courtroom?

403
00:24:48,605 --> 00:24:50,445
Are you really up to this,
Mr Greene?

404
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:52,605
Yeah, course I'm up to it.
Well, then.

405
00:24:52,765 --> 00:24:56,125
There seems to be evidence of
government fraud on a massive scale.

406
00:24:56,285 --> 00:24:59,085
Slush funds, illegal arms deals.

407
00:24:59,245 --> 00:25:01,525
Isn't that enough
to be getting on with?

408
00:25:01,685 --> 00:25:04,885
Look, Mr...Smoking Guy,

409
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,085
my client is up
on murder charges, alright,

410
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:11,165
and so far we haven't
actually found anything

411
00:25:11,325 --> 00:25:13,285
that can meaningfully
help us with our defence.

412
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,045
Do I have to paint you a picture?

413
00:25:15,205 --> 00:25:18,885
Well, maybe not an oil painting
but, yeah, a line drawing?

414
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:20,885
The killer works for ASIO.

415
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:23,685
Is that sufficient detail for you?

416
00:25:25,285 --> 00:25:27,805
Right. Do you have a name?

417
00:25:27,965 --> 00:25:30,485
I can't give you a name.

418
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:32,445
Can't or won't?

419
00:25:32,605 --> 00:25:36,965
This goes to the very top
of the organisation, Mr Greene.

420
00:25:37,125 --> 00:25:39,605
You get the director of ASIO
in the box

421
00:25:39,765 --> 00:25:42,525
and you ask him about
the information I've supplied you.

422
00:25:42,685 --> 00:25:46,085
You embarrass him
and his friends sufficiently

423
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:49,965
and I guarantee he'll sacrifice
the agent involved

424
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:52,165
to put a halt to proceedings.

425
00:25:52,325 --> 00:25:56,165
Handled properly,
you can both save the girl

426
00:25:56,325 --> 00:26:00,125
and bring the whole rotting edifice
crashing down.

427
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:03,765
Some recent dispatches
from the front.

428
00:26:03,925 --> 00:26:06,765
They should help you fill in
some of the details.

429
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:09,885
Yeah.

430
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:24,405
Cleave.

431
00:26:24,565 --> 00:26:26,765
Oh.

432
00:26:27,845 --> 00:26:30,565
Mate, your timing
could not be worse.

433
00:26:35,245 --> 00:26:37,085
Hi, Kirsty.

434
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:38,685
How are you, Cleaver?

435
00:26:38,845 --> 00:26:42,525
Yeah, good. Just, uh, flat out
like a lizard drinking.

436
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:45,805
Yeah.
We're both busy people, aren't we?

437
00:26:45,965 --> 00:26:48,845
Oh. I know. It's just how do you
find the hours in the day?

438
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:51,605
Listen, the reason I came here
was because I wanted to work out

439
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:54,605
where we...where we stand, you know?

440
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:58,405
‘Cause I've been getting these...
these mixed messages from you.

441
00:26:58,565 --> 00:27:01,525
Have my messages been mixed?

442
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:06,965
How's this for size? I come here
and I sit waiting for you.

443
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,885
And I look across the road
and I see your...your client

444
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:14,205
coming out of that cafe
and going straight into the apartment.

445
00:27:14,365 --> 00:27:15,845
Is she living with you now, is she?

446
00:27:16,005 --> 00:27:18,325
Yes, she is, but it's not
what you're thinking.

447
00:27:18,485 --> 00:27:20,205
Isn't it?
No, it's not.

448
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:21,685
She's an old friend.

449
00:27:21,845 --> 00:27:23,405
I've read her book.

450
00:27:23,565 --> 00:27:25,965
Ancient history, Kirsty.

451
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:28,165
Look, the way I see it, Cleaver,

452
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:30,045
we've got two choices, right?

453
00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:33,605
I mean, our relationship
can either be based on pleasure

454
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:36,605
or it can be based on business.

455
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:38,565
And I'm sure you're aware
of the differences.

456
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:40,365
OK. Now, here's the thing...

457
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:41,845
If you opt for the pleasure option,

458
00:27:42,005 --> 00:27:44,405
she has to be out of
your apartment by tonight.

459
00:27:44,565 --> 00:27:48,685
OK, here's the thing...
I will not be made a fool of!

460
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:51,765
OK.

461
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:57,845
My client is up on murder charges
right now.

462
00:27:58,005 --> 00:28:01,245
Now, nothing is happening between us,
but she does need me at the moment

463
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:03,365
and I'm not gonna kick her out,
alright?

464
00:28:03,525 --> 00:28:05,285
I won't.

465
00:28:06,845 --> 00:28:08,245
OK.

466
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:10,205
Great.

467
00:28:10,365 --> 00:28:13,125
Great. We're back in business, then.

468
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:17,045
Goodnight, Cleaver.

469
00:28:17,205 --> 00:28:22,645
Um, Col will have a word to you
about your new repayment plan.

470
00:28:22,805 --> 00:28:25,365
I'm sure you understand
there will be penalties.

471
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:28,085
Yep. Yes.

472
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:31,165
Yes.

473
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:33,565
See you, Kirsty.

474
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:40,565
Mate, I have got a big trial
about to kick off.

475
00:28:40,725 --> 00:28:43,405
You really don't know a good thing
when you see it, do you, mate?

476
00:28:43,565 --> 00:28:45,485
You've been offered
a dream come true.

477
00:28:45,645 --> 00:28:46,965
How is that exactly?

478
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,285
A life with Kirsty.

479
00:28:49,445 --> 00:28:50,965
You just can't see it, can ya?

480
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,765
Not with any great sense of clarity,
mate.

481
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:56,125
Nah, you just think
she's some low rent moll.

482
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:58,805
Well, she would fuckin' buy and sell you
any day of the week.

483
00:28:58,965 --> 00:29:00,445
Mate. Are you back on the gear?

484
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,445
I've seen a lot, Cleave.
I have seen a lot in my time, mate.

485
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:05,685
I've seen some of the shit
that Mick put her through

486
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:07,205
and she is still the most beautiful,

487
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:09,765
most loving human being
I've ever met.

488
00:29:09,925 --> 00:29:12,845
Mate, I could be
right out of line here,

489
00:29:13,005 --> 00:29:16,805
but have you got a bit
of a soft spot for Kirsty?

490
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:20,365
She lives for love, mate.
She lives for bloody love.

491
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,205
And the likes of you, you just...
Mate.

492
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:25,885
Why don't you tell her how you feel?

493
00:29:26,045 --> 00:29:28,885
Nah, nah, I'm no good
when it comes to the romance, mate.

494
00:29:29,045 --> 00:29:31,525
Oh, come on.
I dream about taking her hand.

495
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:33,565
I open my mouth
but I can't say anything.

496
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:35,045
Well, why not?

497
00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:39,205
What is someone like me
gonna say to a goddess, mate?

498
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:43,405
“Kirsty, from the day I met you,

499
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:46,845
“you have filled my heart
with joy and light and song.

500
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:50,765
“Lo these many years
I have tried to hide my passion

501
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:52,685
“but now I can hide it no longer.

502
00:29:52,845 --> 00:29:55,285
“My heart is fit to bust a nut.”

503
00:29:55,445 --> 00:29:57,805
No. “To burst.”

504
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:00,645
Lose the ‘nut'. Lose the ‘nut'.
Never said ‘nut'.

505
00:30:00,805 --> 00:30:02,565
“My heart is fit to burst.”

506
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:05,365
‘Burst'. Gotcha.

507
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:10,965
“l am a man who knows
and understands your heart,

508
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:14,205
“and who wants to devote
his life to your song,

509
00:30:14,365 --> 00:30:17,645
“unlike poor Cleaver Greene,
who is incapable of feeling love,

510
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:21,165
‘owing to personal tragedies
he suffered during his childhood.

511
00:30:21,325 --> 00:30:24,205
“I will give you that love,

512
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:27,365
“the love that Cleaver Greene
so desperately wanted to give you.

513
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:30,925
‘I want to make you happy
beyond your wildest dreams.

514
00:30:31,085 --> 00:30:34,365
“I want to make you mine.”

515
00:30:36,205 --> 00:30:38,125
You reckon that will
do the trick, mate?

516
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:41,685
Putty in your hands, mate.

517
00:30:45,925 --> 00:30:48,205
Hey.

518
00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:54,165
This is the background report on Josh
prepared by the prosecution.

519
00:30:54,325 --> 00:30:56,565
Ah, yes. You saw Barney?

520
00:30:56,725 --> 00:30:59,405
There's a woman who says
that she slept with Josh

521
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:02,965
on three separate occasions in Sydney
since we've returned.

522
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:05,765
She could be lying.
Yeah, she could be.

523
00:31:05,925 --> 00:31:08,565
But in Josh's wallet,
the cops found a couple of receipts

524
00:31:08,725 --> 00:31:10,805
from the hotel that she named.

525
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:14,525
Doesn't mean he didn't love you.

526
00:31:17,285 --> 00:31:19,165
He has a child.

527
00:31:20,405 --> 00:31:22,805
OK. I didn't know that.
No, neither did I.

528
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:28,725
A 2-year-old from a former temp
at good plumbing in London.

529
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:32,005
You know what this means, Cleave?

530
00:31:32,165 --> 00:31:34,885
It means they finally have
a motive, Cleave.

531
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:37,765
I mean, before, I was just
a lying whore, right?

532
00:31:37,925 --> 00:31:40,645
And now I'm a lying, jilted whore.

533
00:31:40,805 --> 00:31:42,725
Don't do this. There's no point.

534
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:45,165
Why not? I mean, what have you got?

535
00:31:45,325 --> 00:31:47,205
What have you even got
that can help me?

536
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:49,765
It was an ASIO agent.

537
00:31:49,925 --> 00:31:52,725
Oh, well, how do you know
that it was an ASIO agent?

538
00:31:52,885 --> 00:31:56,405
Because I just saw the Smoking Guy.

539
00:31:58,205 --> 00:32:02,685
The Smoking Guy? Oh, of course!

540
00:32:02,845 --> 00:32:06,765
Well, I mean, that makes me feel
a whole lot better, Agent Mulder!

541
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,805
Cleaver, I'm looking at
a life sentence

542
00:32:09,965 --> 00:32:11,925
and you're off playing boys' games!

543
00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:14,965
The first thing you said to me
when I saw you in the lockup was,

544
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:17,645
“They've killed him. They said
they were gonna kill him and they have.”

545
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:20,725
You were right.
Well, what if I wasn't?

546
00:32:40,645 --> 00:32:42,365
You think you could eat two?

547
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:44,925
Um, with some maple syrup.
Pancakes!

548
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:46,765
Yes, please.
Where's Maxy?

549
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:48,245
Oh, he's still...
Get your own. Mum.

550
00:32:48,405 --> 00:32:50,045
I'll get him.
There's enough to go around.

551
00:32:50,205 --> 00:32:52,085
You just finish the eggs.
Give me those ones there.

552
00:32:52,245 --> 00:32:53,565
Just wait.
Where's your tie?

553
00:32:53,725 --> 00:32:55,285
In my bag.
Hard or soft, mate?

554
00:32:55,445 --> 00:32:57,725
Breakfast. Max?

555
00:32:57,885 --> 00:32:59,205
Argh!

556
00:32:59,365 --> 00:33:02,205
MAX! Oh!

557
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:06,765
You should get an X-ray.

558
00:33:06,925 --> 00:33:09,325
No, it's just a sprain.

559
00:33:14,965 --> 00:33:17,365
I'm not sure that
we're gonna make it, baby.

560
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:21,725
And it's not just because of me
this time, is it?

561
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:29,925
This woman that you've slept with.
I don't wanna know any details.

562
00:33:30,085 --> 00:33:33,845
But...is it an option
that you're contemplating?

563
00:33:36,165 --> 00:33:39,005
‘Cause you know you're not the kind of
guy who has a one-night stand.

564
00:33:41,525 --> 00:33:43,325
So for you to have done
something like this,

565
00:33:43,485 --> 00:33:44,965
it must be sort of serious.

566
00:33:46,845 --> 00:33:48,325
I know.

567
00:33:51,085 --> 00:33:53,085
And that sort of scares me.

568
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,805
Ah. Ah.

569
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:03,645
Missy's losing it, mate.

570
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:06,645
She thinks I'm putting all her eggs
in the ASIO basket.

571
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:09,285
It is the only basket in town
at the moment, isn't it?

572
00:34:09,445 --> 00:34:11,005
I can't think of any others.

573
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:14,685
Alright, let's go back
to first principles.

574
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:17,325
Well, he didn't have any money.
So it's not that.

575
00:34:17,485 --> 00:34:20,205
He was a root rat.
Maybe there's a jealous lover?

576
00:34:20,365 --> 00:34:22,765
I'm sure there is, mate,
but he's been living in New York

577
00:34:22,925 --> 00:34:25,485
for the last 10 years,
so where do we start?

578
00:34:25,645 --> 00:34:28,645
What about the ex-wife?
Yeah.

579
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:31,085
Can you get your angels onto it, eh?

580
00:34:31,245 --> 00:34:35,445
Has Missy looked at all
the CCTV footage from the hotel?

581
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:37,925
Yeah. Once more with feeling,
you reckon?

582
00:34:38,085 --> 00:34:41,125
Yes, please.
Get her out of the bloody flat!

583
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:50,045
I've seen this movie before and
I wanted to walk out the first time.

584
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:51,845
Take a break if you have to.

585
00:34:52,005 --> 00:34:53,605
It's getting us nowhere.

586
00:34:53,765 --> 00:34:56,165
There's gotta be witnesses, DNA.

587
00:34:56,325 --> 00:34:57,645
There's gotta be something

588
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:00,245
instead of you just hanging around
in car parks.

589
00:35:00,405 --> 00:35:02,085
Alright. OK.

590
00:35:02,245 --> 00:35:05,925
You want the DNA report? There it is.

591
00:35:06,085 --> 00:35:08,605
It's a fuckin' hotel room, Miss.

592
00:35:08,765 --> 00:35:10,245
How many different sets of DNA

593
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:13,245
do you think they found in there,
including yours on the knife?

594
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:15,645
You tell me what we've missed.

595
00:35:20,965 --> 00:35:22,685
What if you can't get ASIO
into the box?

596
00:35:22,845 --> 00:35:24,885
We'll get 'em.
They'll fight the subpoenas.

597
00:35:25,045 --> 00:35:28,525
Then we'll fight back.
What if we lose that fight?

598
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:30,725
Missy. Missy.

599
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:33,805
Oi.

600
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:37,445
We need to talk.
Can you just let go of me, please?

601
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:47,765
For a woman about to marry
the man of her dreams,

602
00:35:47,925 --> 00:35:50,045
she's got a hell of a case
of the marriage jitters.

603
00:35:50,205 --> 00:35:51,685
What the fuck would you know?

604
00:35:53,205 --> 00:35:56,245
Oh, has everybody gone barking mad?

605
00:36:09,285 --> 00:36:10,605
Hello.

606
00:36:10,765 --> 00:36:13,045
I'm just ringing
to make sure you're OK.

607
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:14,845
Hm. Couldn't be better.

608
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:16,725
I'm sorry about yesterday.

609
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:18,645
It wasn't your fault.

610
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:21,845
Anyway, we both came to our senses.

611
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:25,565
Listen, I've gotta go.
I'll call you later.

612
00:36:27,325 --> 00:36:29,085
What happened to you?

613
00:36:29,245 --> 00:36:30,645
Hit and run.

614
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:33,565
Ought to be a law.
But what can you do?

615
00:36:34,045 --> 00:36:36,405
Listen, I need
a highly rated favour.

616
00:36:36,565 --> 00:36:37,885
Oh, yeah?

617
00:36:38,045 --> 00:36:39,845
If anyone asks, we had
a working lunch yesterday.

618
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:41,005
What?

619
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,685
I blew off a meeting
with the Premier,

620
00:36:42,845 --> 00:36:44,165
principally because my head
would have exploded

621
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:45,645
with boredom had I attended it.

622
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:48,405
Told him we were working on
the Proceeds of Crime legislation.

623
00:36:48,565 --> 00:36:50,645
Now, he's more than
a little paranoid at the moment,

624
00:36:50,805 --> 00:36:53,405
so if you could diarise us
between 12:00 and 2:30.

625
00:36:53,565 --> 00:36:55,365
Oh, really?

626
00:36:55,525 --> 00:36:57,925
You already got something
in your diary for lunch yesterday?

627
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,565
No.
Nope. So what's the problem?

628
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:05,205
Thanks, Engels. I owe you one.

629
00:37:09,805 --> 00:37:12,085
Melissa, how do you
feel about the charges?

630
00:37:12,245 --> 00:37:13,565
Did you do it?

631
00:37:15,285 --> 00:37:16,765
Missy, tell us about
your book sales.

632
00:37:16,925 --> 00:37:18,765
Thanks, guys.
We're going straight in.

633
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,485
My learned friend Mr Greene

634
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:41,805
will doubtlessly tell a tale
of an elaborate conspiracy

635
00:37:41,965 --> 00:37:44,285
to assassinate Joshua Floyd,

636
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:47,165
that he was a threat
and a menace to governments,

637
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:50,845
security agencies,
financial institutions, you name it.

638
00:37:51,005 --> 00:37:52,725
But, ladies and gentlemen,

639
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:57,285
let us look at the actual legacy
of Joshua Floyd.

640
00:37:57,445 --> 00:38:00,405
The guns are still being fired
in the Middle East

641
00:38:00,565 --> 00:38:03,045
but no-one on Wall Street has been.

642
00:38:03,205 --> 00:38:04,845
No governments have been toppled,

643
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:07,165
no leaders have been forced
from office.

644
00:38:07,325 --> 00:38:10,605
At the worst,
he has caused embarrassment

645
00:38:10,765 --> 00:38:13,365
to a handful of minor officials.

646
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:15,805
Tragically for Mr Greene,

647
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:20,365
this is simply
a garden-variety murder,

648
00:38:20,525 --> 00:38:23,045
motivated by jealousy,

649
00:38:23,205 --> 00:38:26,245
a jealousy so extreme
that it caused the accused

650
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:29,565
to plunge a knife
into her fiancé's back,

651
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:32,645
not once, not twice,

652
00:38:32,805 --> 00:38:35,165
but three times.

653
00:38:35,325 --> 00:38:40,045
It's easy to mock
conspiracy theories, isn't it?

654
00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:44,365
In 1963, the theory
that there was a conspiracy

655
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:47,245
to assassinate President Kennedy
of the United States

656
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:50,605
was dismissed as absurd.

657
00:38:50,765 --> 00:38:52,565
In 1973,

658
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:55,605
the theory that Nixon's henchmen

659
00:38:55,765 --> 00:38:59,245
broke into the Democrat headquarters
in the Watergate building

660
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:01,605
was dismissed as absurd.

661
00:39:01,765 --> 00:39:03,885
Why on earth would they bother?

662
00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:05,765
Why would they risk everything?

663
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:09,925
Ladies and gentlemen,
history has perpetually taught us

664
00:39:10,085 --> 00:39:12,925
that power corrupts.

665
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:16,925
And the threat of the exposure

666
00:39:17,085 --> 00:39:19,405
of that corruption generates fear.

667
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,165
Ladies and gentlemen,

668
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:22,965
Joshua Floyd was murdered

669
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:27,285
not necessarily because of
anything he'd already said or done,

670
00:39:27,445 --> 00:39:32,245
but because of the fear
of what he might do.

671
00:39:32,405 --> 00:39:36,765
Now, my client loved Joshua Floyd.

672
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:40,405
My client...is a patsy.

673
00:39:42,565 --> 00:39:45,885
Um, I chatted to Joshua briefly

674
00:39:46,045 --> 00:39:47,445
and he gave me his card.

675
00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:51,445
Then I called him the next day and
he told me to meet him at a hotel.

676
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:55,725
Where you proceeded
to have sexual intercourse?

677
00:39:57,165 --> 00:39:58,485
Yes.

678
00:39:58,645 --> 00:40:01,605
And how many times
did you meet him for this purpose?

679
00:40:01,765 --> 00:40:06,205
Um, three times in all.
Thank you.

680
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:08,965
Mr Greene?

681
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:12,525
Uh, no questions,
thank you, Your Honour.

682
00:40:18,965 --> 00:40:21,125
So you didn't think
I had a good opening, Miss?

683
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,845
You've made me
Australia's Lee Harvey Oswald.

684
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,325
I couldn't be happier.

685
00:40:25,485 --> 00:40:27,605
Between that and
your rigorous cross-examination

686
00:40:27,765 --> 00:40:30,765
of Miss ‘No Questions, Your Honour',
I'm in legal heaven.

687
00:40:30,925 --> 00:40:32,925
What do you think pushing that girl
would have added?

688
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:34,685
She has a solid alibi.

689
00:40:34,845 --> 00:40:37,325
Well, it could have been
any one of his tarts.

690
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:40,125
What about Therese?
She's in there every day.

691
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:41,645
You know, she never misses a minute

692
00:40:41,805 --> 00:40:43,285
with nothing but fucking hate
in her eyes.

693
00:40:43,445 --> 00:40:45,725
Maybe she just couldn't stand
the idea of Josh marrying again.

694
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:47,805
She was in Melbourne.

695
00:40:50,005 --> 00:40:51,605
Hey, guess what?

696
00:40:51,765 --> 00:40:53,205
ASIO aren't gonna fight
the subpoenas.

697
00:40:53,365 --> 00:40:55,005
They just put out a press release

698
00:40:55,165 --> 00:40:56,685
stating they're going
to fully cooperate.

699
00:40:56,845 --> 00:41:00,245
Yes. I knew it!

700
00:41:00,405 --> 00:41:04,245
I knew they'd cave.
They couldn't possibly say no publicly.

701
00:41:16,645 --> 00:41:17,965
Dead, dead, dead mouse.

702
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,365
Nicole, dead mouse!

703
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:23,405
Dead mouse!

704
00:41:26,365 --> 00:41:27,685
Hey, Nicole.

705
00:41:27,845 --> 00:41:29,925
Sorry.

706
00:41:30,085 --> 00:41:31,805
Ah, yes. Yep. Give me those.

707
00:41:37,325 --> 00:41:39,885
It was here 10 seconds ago,
I saved it,

708
00:41:40,045 --> 00:41:42,325
and now it's fucking gone
off the screen.

709
00:41:42,485 --> 00:41:44,285
That's it, three hours work.

710
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:46,125
I think you'll find that's it,
isn't it?

711
00:41:46,285 --> 00:41:48,125
Thank you.

712
00:42:37,925 --> 00:42:40,885
Wakey, wakey! Hands off snakey!

713
00:42:41,045 --> 00:42:43,565
It's showtime, folks.

714
00:42:43,725 --> 00:42:46,685
Mate, the prosecution's gonna howl
when they get this so late.

715
00:42:46,845 --> 00:42:48,525
I know, I know.
Not to mention the judge.

716
00:42:48,685 --> 00:42:50,965
I know. Nicole. NICOLE!

717
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:52,445
Yes?

718
00:42:52,605 --> 00:42:55,125
We've got to get these over to judgey
and Greg at warp speed.

719
00:42:55,285 --> 00:42:57,525
By warp speed, you mean
you want me to carry them?

720
00:42:57,685 --> 00:43:00,485
I don't need your special brand
of insight today, OK?

721
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:01,965
Nicole.
OK.

722
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,605
But someone's gotta check
the agreed time codes

723
00:43:03,765 --> 00:43:05,085
on the DVD of the hotel footage.

724
00:43:05,245 --> 00:43:06,565
I can do that.

725
00:43:06,725 --> 00:43:08,565
Yeah, sure you can.

726
00:43:09,805 --> 00:43:11,125
I can do that.

727
00:43:11,285 --> 00:43:13,485
Oh, this is... It's broken.
It's fucked.

728
00:43:13,645 --> 00:43:15,165
Give it to me.

729
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:37,525
That's her.

730
00:43:37,685 --> 00:43:39,725
Who?

731
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:41,845
There's this woman.
She comes to court every day.

732
00:43:42,005 --> 00:43:44,205
That's her. I'm sure that's her.

733
00:43:50,885 --> 00:43:52,245
Who is she?

734
00:43:52,405 --> 00:43:54,445
I'll go get an ID.

735
00:43:54,605 --> 00:43:57,845
You better be bloody quick, mate.
You're gonna have to stall.

736
00:43:58,005 --> 00:44:00,645
Yeah, well,
I can only stall so long.

737
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:02,805
Are you sure?

738
00:44:20,085 --> 00:44:22,285
Mr Greene?
Your Honour?

739
00:44:22,445 --> 00:44:24,165
Are you not ready to commence?

740
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:27,765
Indeed, Your Honour.

741
00:44:27,925 --> 00:44:30,605
Uh...

742
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:37,485
Mr Lonsdale, you are the director

743
00:44:37,645 --> 00:44:40,845
of the...Australian Security

744
00:44:41,005 --> 00:44:43,925
and Intelligence...Organisation...

745
00:44:46,525 --> 00:44:48,725
..otherwise known as ASIO.

746
00:44:48,885 --> 00:44:51,205
Is that, uh, correct?

747
00:44:51,365 --> 00:44:52,685
I am.

748
00:44:52,845 --> 00:44:57,125
Now, Mr Lonsdale, I noticed
that you chose to affirm your oath

749
00:44:57,285 --> 00:44:59,765
rather than swear to God.

750
00:44:59,925 --> 00:45:04,525
Is that, uh, a fair comment?

751
00:45:04,685 --> 00:45:06,085
I did.

752
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:10,005
So you don't believe in a god at all?

753
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,365
I'm an atheist, Mr Greene.

754
00:45:12,525 --> 00:45:15,005
I see.

755
00:45:16,645 --> 00:45:18,645
Are your parents religious folk,
Mr Lonsdale?

756
00:45:18,805 --> 00:45:21,045
Mr Greene, what on earth
are you playing at?

757
00:45:21,205 --> 00:45:24,525
This case, uh, uh,

758
00:45:24,685 --> 00:45:27,045
as Your Honour very kindly pointed out,

759
00:45:27,205 --> 00:45:31,245
does have certain elements
of the conspiracy theory to it, uh...

760
00:45:31,405 --> 00:45:33,685
Very much like ‘The Da Vinci Code'.

761
00:45:33,845 --> 00:45:35,165
Mr Greene.

762
00:45:35,325 --> 00:45:36,925
You're a wanker, Cleaver.

763
00:45:38,605 --> 00:45:42,405
Uh, may I have one moment,
Your Honour, to take instructions?

764
00:45:42,565 --> 00:45:45,685
Mr Greene, my patience
is wearing wafer thin.

765
00:45:45,845 --> 00:45:47,525
Thank you, Your Honour.

766
00:45:49,525 --> 00:45:51,725
It's her, mate.

767
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:53,525
Please tell me she's with ASIO.

768
00:45:53,685 --> 00:45:57,725
Her husband was the doctor
in Missy's book that topped himself.

769
00:45:57,885 --> 00:46:00,365
So ASIO's...?
Got nothing to do with it.

770
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:03,605
No, but what was
the Smoking Man...?

771
00:46:05,365 --> 00:46:07,485
Oh, shit.
Yeah.

772
00:46:07,645 --> 00:46:08,845
Mr Greene.

773
00:46:09,005 --> 00:46:11,245
Oh, shit.
Yes, I know.

774
00:46:12,485 --> 00:46:14,045
Oh...

775
00:46:17,725 --> 00:46:20,205
No further questions, thank you.

776
00:46:20,365 --> 00:46:24,645
No further questions?
As if you've asked one.

777
00:46:24,805 --> 00:46:28,005
So I take it you're no longer
pursuing this line of attack?

778
00:46:28,165 --> 00:46:29,485
I'm afraid not.

779
00:46:29,645 --> 00:46:31,925
Do you have any idea
the amount of time

780
00:46:32,085 --> 00:46:34,125
you've wasted
on this goose chase, Cleaver?

781
00:46:34,285 --> 00:46:36,005
This is bordering on contempt.

782
00:46:36,165 --> 00:46:37,605
I was set up, Ben.

783
00:46:37,765 --> 00:46:39,725
Oh, set up? By whom?

784
00:46:39,885 --> 00:46:41,445
By ASIO.

785
00:46:41,605 --> 00:46:44,685
All those smoking guns in all
those files were leaked to me

786
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:47,245
by someone who claimed
to be a friend of Josh's,

787
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:51,525
but, on reflection,
I'm sure it was all bullshit.

788
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:54,005
I'm sure there's not
a single truth amongst them.

789
00:46:54,165 --> 00:46:56,725
Why would ASIO leak you bullshit,
Cleaver?

790
00:46:56,885 --> 00:46:59,165
So that I'd get up and spout at Greg

791
00:46:59,325 --> 00:47:03,045
and be made to look like a tit
by the director of ASIO,

792
00:47:03,205 --> 00:47:05,645
which would then be vindicated
in open court.

793
00:47:05,805 --> 00:47:08,605
Who's going to trust
good plumbing after that?

794
00:47:08,765 --> 00:47:11,245
And how do you know this?

795
00:47:11,405 --> 00:47:14,445
Because we know who really did it.

796
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:24,805
Your Honour, I'd like to call
Mrs Faye Chambers, please?

797
00:47:26,285 --> 00:47:29,165
Do you know why you've been called
to give evidence, Mrs Chambers?

798
00:47:29,325 --> 00:47:31,285
Yes.

799
00:47:31,445 --> 00:47:33,685
Mrs Chambers, your husband

800
00:47:33,845 --> 00:47:38,605
was the noted oncologist
Graham Chambers, is that right?

801
00:47:38,765 --> 00:47:40,085
He was.

802
00:47:40,245 --> 00:47:43,525
He devoted himself
to saving people's lives.

803
00:47:43,685 --> 00:47:47,485
He passed away recently, did he not?

804
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:49,605
He did.

805
00:47:51,605 --> 00:47:52,925
I'm so sorry.

806
00:47:53,085 --> 00:47:56,045
Mrs Chambers,
could you tell the court

807
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:58,925
how your husband died, please?

808
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,205
He took an overdose.

809
00:48:01,365 --> 00:48:02,965
I see.

810
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:06,085
Do you know why he took an overdose?

811
00:48:06,245 --> 00:48:09,765
He killed himself
because of that filthy book.

812
00:48:09,925 --> 00:48:12,365
That vile, evil book.

813
00:48:12,525 --> 00:48:15,565
The book you're referring to,
Mrs Chambers,

814
00:48:15,725 --> 00:48:19,645
is ‘A Thousand Lies I Have Told'
by the accused, is that right?

815
00:48:19,805 --> 00:48:21,125
I am.

816
00:48:21,285 --> 00:48:23,085
He showed me the book

817
00:48:23,245 --> 00:48:26,485
and told me what had happened
in that brothel.

818
00:48:26,645 --> 00:48:29,005
I didn't care. I loved him.

819
00:48:30,205 --> 00:48:33,245
I could cope because
99% of him was pure good.

820
00:48:33,405 --> 00:48:37,445
He wasn't mentioned
by name in the book.

821
00:48:37,605 --> 00:48:42,165
No, but he was terrified
people would find out somehow.

822
00:48:44,445 --> 00:48:48,885
She had betrayed his confidence.
She destroyed him.

823
00:48:49,045 --> 00:48:52,845
And I wanted that whore
to find out what it felt like

824
00:48:53,005 --> 00:48:55,685
to suffer the sort of loss I had.

825
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:37,725
Yep.

826
00:49:39,365 --> 00:49:40,845
Come in.

827
00:49:42,525 --> 00:49:45,285
Ms Engels.
Premier.

828
00:49:45,445 --> 00:49:46,925
Oh, dear. What happened to you?

829
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:49,285
Oh, just a little accident at home.

830
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,885
Please, have a seat.
Thanks.

831
00:49:51,045 --> 00:49:53,245
Delighted to meet you, at last.
You too.

832
00:49:53,405 --> 00:49:58,965
So I need to ask you
a very delicate question, if I may.

833
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:02,845
My understanding
is that on the 17th of this month,

834
00:50:03,005 --> 00:50:05,525
you had a working lunch
with Cal McGregor.

835
00:50:05,685 --> 00:50:07,765
17th? Um...

836
00:50:10,245 --> 00:50:11,925
Uh...

837
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:17,005
Ah, yes, we were finalising
the amendments

838
00:50:17,165 --> 00:50:19,085
to the Proceeds of Crime legislation,
I believe.

839
00:50:19,245 --> 00:50:20,565
Thank God.

840
00:50:20,725 --> 00:50:22,405
I'm sure this won't be
a secret much longer,

841
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:24,805
so I should tell you the reason
I'm asking you this question

842
00:50:24,965 --> 00:50:28,205
is because a woman has alleged

843
00:50:28,365 --> 00:50:31,485
Cal sexually assaulted her
at that time.

844
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:33,525
Now, I, for one,
never doubted his innocence

845
00:50:33,685 --> 00:50:35,685
but the fact that he has
an ironclad alibi

846
00:50:35,845 --> 00:50:38,605
comes as an enormous relief.

847
00:50:38,765 --> 00:50:42,125
Now, some detectives
are in my conference room.

848
00:50:42,285 --> 00:50:43,845
They'll want to ask you
some questions

849
00:50:44,005 --> 00:50:46,165
and get a signed statement.

850
00:50:46,325 --> 00:50:48,005
I assume that won't be a problem?

851
00:50:48,165 --> 00:50:50,085
No. No problem.

852
00:51:21,525 --> 00:51:24,365
Right here. Thank you.

853
00:51:24,525 --> 00:51:26,005
Oh.

854
00:51:32,685 --> 00:51:35,725
I'll be right back with the menus
and some water for the table.

855
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:37,525
Enjoy your evening. Thank you.

856
00:52:01,805 --> 00:52:03,405
Doc.

857
00:52:05,485 --> 00:52:07,645
Mwah!

858
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:09,165
How's it hanging?

859
00:52:09,325 --> 00:52:10,645
We got a bottle?

860
00:52:10,805 --> 00:52:12,125
I've just ordered a glass.

861
00:52:12,285 --> 00:52:14,525
Let's get a bottle. Hey-ho!

862
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:17,765
Um...

863
00:52:17,925 --> 00:52:20,485
Ah. So I was thinking
on the way here...

864
00:52:20,645 --> 00:52:25,285
If you ever met royalty,
would you bow or curtsy?

865
00:52:25,445 --> 00:52:27,765
Because I don't think...
I wouldn't even nod.

866
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:31,005
Hello. Can I get...? Oh, fuck.

867
00:52:31,165 --> 00:52:33,525
I mean, I'd give them my paw.

868
00:52:33,685 --> 00:52:36,125
I'm not being
deliberately disrespectful.

869
00:52:36,285 --> 00:52:38,405
It's just... Fuck, what did
they ever do to earn it?

870
00:52:38,565 --> 00:52:42,165
Hello. Oh, yes. Gargon?

871
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:47,045
If we have to bow to the unworthy,
why don't we bow to supermodels?

872
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,925
At least they're cute. Hm?

873
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:52,325
I'm gonna bow to Gisele Blindchen.

874
00:52:52,485 --> 00:52:56,085
Hello? Who do you have to fuck
to get a drop of something around here?

875
00:52:56,245 --> 00:52:59,725
Hello? Yes, mate. Yes, you.

876
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,325
Yeah. Come on, mate.

877
00:53:02,485 --> 00:53:03,885
Yeah. Come on.

878
00:53:04,045 --> 00:53:05,885
Ping. Bingo!

879
00:53:06,045 --> 00:53:08,045
Yes. Nobody likes a snitch.

880
00:53:08,205 --> 00:53:10,045
Oh.

881
00:53:10,205 --> 00:53:12,485
Come on. Thirsty human in the room.

882
00:53:12,645 --> 00:53:15,485
“O for a beaker of the warm South.”

883
00:53:17,765 --> 00:53:21,285
Can you see me now? Huh?
Can you...? What are you doing?

884
00:53:21,445 --> 00:53:23,605
We're better when
there's distance between us.

885
00:53:23,765 --> 00:53:26,565
Oh, come on, sweetheart.
Just a little joke.

886
00:53:26,725 --> 00:53:28,645
Just a little joke.
Come on. You've had enough.

887
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:30,485
Oh, come on, mate. I haven't had any.

888
00:53:30,645 --> 00:53:34,245
I haven't had a single thing.
A man is not a camel.

889
00:53:44,845 --> 00:53:46,165
Hey, Roger. How you going?

890
00:53:46,325 --> 00:53:48,805
Hey. Yeah. Yeah, good, Wen.

891
00:53:48,965 --> 00:53:51,725
Good. You?

892
00:53:51,885 --> 00:53:55,085
Do you feel like a drink?

893
00:53:59,405 --> 00:54:01,525
Oh, shit. Col.

894
00:54:02,645 --> 00:54:05,445
It worked, mate.
It fuckin' worked.

895
00:54:05,605 --> 00:54:08,685
I can't believe it. We're in love, mate.
Me and Kirsty.

896
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:11,365
Oh, mate.
I couldn't be happier for you.

897
00:54:11,525 --> 00:54:14,085
I can't thank you enough, mate.
We are over the moon.

898
00:54:14,245 --> 00:54:17,005
Oh, well, you know,
I'm heartbroken, of course,

899
00:54:17,165 --> 00:54:19,365
but what are mates for?

900
00:54:19,525 --> 00:54:22,325
Makes this so hard, Cleave.
What's that?

901
00:54:24,365 --> 00:54:26,925
Naturally, Kirsty
is very grateful too, of course,

902
00:54:27,085 --> 00:54:29,525
but, like she says,
business is business,

903
00:54:29,685 --> 00:54:32,565
and I'm not about to upset
my little dumpling now, am I, mate?

904
00:54:32,725 --> 00:54:35,765
Matter of fact,
this is a special request from her.

905
00:54:45,045 --> 00:54:47,245
Ooooh!

906
