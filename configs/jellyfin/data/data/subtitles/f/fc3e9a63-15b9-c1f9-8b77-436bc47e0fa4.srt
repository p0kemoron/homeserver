Nigel Turner?

9
00:01:03,886 --> 00:01:06,246
Kirsty Ann McPhee. Good Lord!

10
00:01:06,406 --> 00:01:08,606
How are you?
I'm good.

11
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:10,926
Yeah, I'm really good. God.

12
00:01:11,086 --> 00:01:13,566
God, it's been such a long time.

13
00:01:13,726 --> 00:01:16,046
So, how's your mum?

14
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,166
She passed away last April.

15
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:20,206
Oh, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:20,366 --> 00:01:23,126
Come on. I can't wait forever.
It was very peaceful.

17
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:25,366
And all the family
was with her, so...

18
00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:28,766
She was a lovely lady.
She was.

19
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:30,246
She always liked you.

20
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:34,486
And, uh...

21
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:36,926
You're married or...?

22
00:01:37,086 --> 00:01:39,846
Yeah. Mick.

23
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:41,566
Mick! Hey, Mick.

24
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,526
Mick! This is Nigel.

25
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,006
Nigel, Mick. Nigel and I
went to school together.

26
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,366
And we grew up a block away
from each other.

27
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:52,646
Nigel.

28
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:53,886
Oh!

29
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:55,366
Ohh!

30
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:57,766
Well, maybe we could
catch up sometime or...

31
00:01:57,926 --> 00:02:00,806
Oh, no, I don't think
that's a good idea.

32
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:03,206
No, I understand.

33
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:12,846
Thirsty work, isn't it?

34
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:14,486
Yeah.

35
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:18,726
Hey, I ran into Clive Witherspoon
the other day.

36
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:20,886
He's done well for himself,
that guy.

37
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:23,006
Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah. I heard.

38
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:26,086
Um, a chain
of electrical stores or...

39
00:02:31,646 --> 00:02:34,806
Um, hey, I would
really like to catch up.

40
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:36,966
You can get hold of me
on this number.

41
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:41,606
Um, I should get back to it,
I suppose.

42
00:02:41,766 --> 00:02:42,806
Kirsty.

43
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:45,646
I'm not married.

44
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,366
They only laid this concrete down
a few weeks ago to extend the car park.

45
00:03:09,526 --> 00:03:10,966
Just what the world needs —
bigger car parks.

46
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:13,686
The water mains hadn't blown up,
we never would have found the body.

47
00:03:13,846 --> 00:03:15,686
Pretty recent?
Yeah.

48
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:20,126
My guess is on or around July 10
sometime after 9:21pm.

49
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:21,846
All this without
the aid of microscopes.

50
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:24,286
Well, some idiot left a
shopping receipt in one of the bags.

51
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:27,566
This used to be orchards.
Fancy.

52
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:29,366
They pull down beautiful orchards
to make a supermarket

53
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:32,726
that sells oranges
they fly in from Spain.

54
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:35,926
We got a full body yet?

55
00:03:36,086 --> 00:03:37,406
Still chasing the left leg.

56
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:39,486
My guess is when they
put him together, we'll have

57
00:03:39,646 --> 00:03:42,726
a balding 40s white Caucasian male,
slightly overweight.

58
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:45,966
I think we've got your full set now.
All non-recyclable.

59
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:49,726
Go and ask them for
their security tapes from July 10.

60
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:51,886
Ask em if they saw
anything suspicious.

61
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:53,486
They won't know.

62
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:55,726
They never know anything
in supermarkets.

63
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:58,846
Get me a Spanish orange
while you're at it, double bagged.

64
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,126
Jesus Christ.

65
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:04,486
No, you are not
bloody interested in my call,

66
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:06,606
or somebody would frigging answer.

67
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:08,966
How much do you
want to say this book cost?

68
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:12,246
Is it a law book?
If you want it to be.

69
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:16,086
Uh, 120 bucks.
And give it a boring title.

70
00:04:16,246 --> 00:04:19,326
‘L'Estrange on Constitutional Law'.
And smudge the name of the shop.

71
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:23,286
If only you could claim
your gambling debts as deductions.

72
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:25,126
Will you go to prison, Dad?

73
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:28,286
Oh, I think the Tax Department
will probably count

74
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:30,886
my eight years with her
as time served.

75
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:33,366
Come on, fill in
some receipts, please.

76
00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:35,086
You alright, Fuzz?

77
00:04:35,246 --> 00:04:37,606
Um, yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

78
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:40,766
This is the, uh,
forensic accountant's report.

79
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:44,326
Somehow, she's managed to get hold
of all my Visa, Amex,

80
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:46,486
every bloody card statement
for the past eight years.

81
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:48,566
Come on, you cocks.

82
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:51,086
Can you just please...
mind your...

83
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:52,846
Thank you very much.

84
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:58,766
Can you just fill in a receipt for
the purchase of a new wig, please?

85
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:00,766
Thank you very much.

86
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:07,246
Well. Nice of you to take the trouble.
Is he ready? I'm double-parked.

87
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:09,366
Fuzz, get a move on.

88
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:11,486
How is he? Is he OK?
Yeah, he's alright.

89
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:13,286
Still a bit heartbroken.

90
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:16,926
Um, can I float an idea past you?
No.

91
00:05:17,086 --> 00:05:21,286
‘Cause they're about to bring down
a finding in my tax case,

92
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,166
and I'm pretty sure
they're gonna find against me.

93
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:26,606
How sure?
In the range of 100% and upwards.

94
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:28,846
My best guess is
I probably owe about

95
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:32,166
786,500...
Fuzz, we're leaving.

96
00:05:33,846 --> 00:05:35,286
All 'm saying is...
Fuzz, hurry up!

97
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:37,726
The house is in my name too.
You cannot be serious.

98
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:39,766
A second mortgage. You wouldn't
have to worry about anything.

99
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:42,766
I'd cover all the payments.
If anything, you're gonna be better off.

100
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,566
It is my house! Fuck you.

101
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:46,566
The only reason your name appears
anywhere on the title

102
00:05:46,726 --> 00:05:49,446
is because you said it would cause you
a tax problem if taken off.

103
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:52,726
Now, look, I've spoken to the bank.
They seem quite positive.

104
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,726
You spoke to the bank? You spoke
to the bank without talking to...

105
00:05:55,886 --> 00:05:57,366
Get me a gun!

106
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,846
You will not touch my house.

107
00:06:00,006 --> 00:06:02,646
Alright? You will not come
anywhere near my house.

108
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:04,286
And you will not come
anywhere near me.

109
00:06:04,446 --> 00:06:07,086
Just calm down, alright?
It's just chaos at the moment.

110
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:08,846
Yes. You are the chaos.

111
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:11,526
You're not the end result
of some butterfly effect.

112
00:06:11,686 --> 00:06:13,006
You ARE the butterfly...

113
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,086
You are the original
fucking polka-dotted butterfly

114
00:06:16,246 --> 00:06:18,886
that causes every bit of chaos
on this planet.

115
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,486
Fuzz! Get in.

116
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,326
I am humbled and thrilled
that the people of Huntley

117
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:39,006
have chosen me to represent them.

118
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,486
Naturally, like all of you here,

119
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:44,086
I am only sorry
our government was not returned...

120
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:45,966
Yes.

121
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:49,606
Rest assured, I am eagerly looking
forward to the challenges ahead,

122
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:52,086
and I promise you,
from the opposition benches,

123
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,326
I will be taking it right up
to this new government.

124
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:58,126
Watch this space.
Exciting times ahead.

125
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:00,246
I'm ruined.

126
00:07:00,406 --> 00:07:02,926
I've destroyed my life.

127
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:05,046
I've given up 70% of my income,

128
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:06,526
and for what?

129
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:08,526
Joe's dead.

130
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:10,486
Premier's gone.

131
00:07:11,846 --> 00:07:14,046
I've got no supporters
inside the party.

132
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:18,806
I'm gonna be a backbencher
in state parliament till I die.

133
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:21,526
Labor might get back in.
Oh, it was a landslide.

134
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:24,046
They'll get three terms at least.

135
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,406
No, I was better off at the bar.

136
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:33,446
The only thing I've got left
to hold onto is you.

137
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:38,246
I do have you, don't I?

138
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:43,366
My name is Jane.

139
00:07:43,526 --> 00:07:44,846
Jane Tanner.

140
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,766
Both my parents
are still alive,

141
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:48,646
though you may not pick it
looking at them.

142
00:07:48,806 --> 00:07:51,206
They haven't worked in 20 years.

143
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:55,486
They.. live off three pensions
and sit in a caravan in Taree

144
00:07:55,646 --> 00:07:58,006
and drink beer and watch TV all day.

145
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,246
When I was 17, I pissed off,

146
00:08:00,406 --> 00:08:02,406
and a few years later,
I became a prostitute

147
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,646
because, gosh, it paid well.

148
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:06,766
I let that career option
lapse a little while ago

149
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:08,926
so I could start to feel
better about myself.

150
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:11,246
I'm so sorry, David.

151
00:08:18,926 --> 00:08:22,606
I think I'd like you to go now...

152
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:25,366
..Jane.

153
00:08:34,926 --> 00:08:34,966
So you say you've never met
Nigel Turner?

154
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:38,326
So you say you've never met
Nigel Turner?

155
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:40,526
Name doesn't ring any bells.

156
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,486
I knew a Turner in Kyabram.

157
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:46,846
Florist, divorced,
lives in Dulwich Hill.

158
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:48,766
No, I buy all me flowers
in the city.

159
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:51,166
Syd Turner.

160
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:53,446
That was the bloke from Kyabram.

161
00:08:54,846 --> 00:08:56,166
He was a diesel mechanic.

162
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:58,326
Sorry I'm late.

163
00:08:58,486 --> 00:08:59,846
I got...

164
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,446
You know you're not obliged
to answer, Mick.

165
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:05,446
Yeah, it's alright. Just having
a friendly chat with Bill.

166
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:09,006
You know Barney, Bill?
Bill, Barney. Barney, Bill.

167
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:12,766
Nigel Turner's mutilated body
was dug up near Water Street Park.

168
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:14,366
Out near Botany. Yeah, I know.

169
00:09:14,526 --> 00:09:16,926
We laid some concrete out there
a month or so back.

170
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:19,126
Yes, over his body.

171
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:22,686
He was last seen alive
at 7:30pm on July 10,

172
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:26,886
and your company was pouring
concrete at 1:30am the same night.

173
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:33,286
Oh, we don't like to inconvenience
supermarket customers.

174
00:09:33,446 --> 00:09:35,286
You know that area
used to be orchards?

175
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:39,246
You said he was divorced?

176
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:41,246
Might be worth
checking with his wife.

177
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:43,366
They're often at the back
of these things, you know.

178
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:45,446
We've found traces of your DNA
on his body.

179
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:48,886
And we're arresting you
on a charge of murder.

180
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:53,366
Mind if I have a private word
with Barney, please, Bill?

181
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:10,486
Get me Cleaver, and get me
out of this fucking shit hole.

182
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:14,326
If they've got your DNA,
it's not gonna be that easy.

183
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:17,406
He was a fucking florist
from Dulwich fucking Hill.

184
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:19,326
How the fuck would I know him?

185
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:23,246
I need you to brief Cleaver for me
straightaway. You got it?

186
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:26,246
I think we should go with a silk
this time. Cleaver is...

187
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:28,126
I know exactly
what fucking Cleaver is.

188
00:10:28,286 --> 00:10:29,766
Right?

189
00:10:29,926 --> 00:10:31,246
And he's who I want.

190
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:33,086
There are many
more eminent barristers...

191
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:35,326
I don't want fucking eminent!
I want someone I can trust.

192
00:10:35,486 --> 00:10:37,526
Someone I know who fucking owes me.
You got it, Barney?

193
00:10:37,686 --> 00:10:40,366
I'm sorry, Mick,
but I don't work with him anymore.

194
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:42,246
It's a matter of principle for me.

195
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:46,366
How much business did I steer
your way last year? 200? 300K?

196
00:10:47,406 --> 00:10:50,686
That's a lot to lose
for a principle, Barney.

197
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:53,126
I'm sorry, Mick.

198
00:10:53,150 --> 00:11:01,150
http://hiqve.com/

199
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:18,806
So literally everything
I know about you is made-up?

200
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:21,166
Pretty much.

201
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:25,006
You would have never looked twice
at me if you'd have known the truth.

202
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,526
You got that right, Jane Tanner.

203
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,726
How many clients did you service?

204
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:32,926
Oh, please, let's not go there.

205
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:34,406
It's just a question.

206
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:39,326
Roughly how many times a week
were you fucked by total strangers?

207
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:45,166
I'm really sorry that I hurt you.

208
00:11:45,326 --> 00:11:47,566
Goodbye, David.

209
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:54,806
What the hell
did you think would happen?

210
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:58,726
That it might remain a secret,
that we might be happy?

211
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,966
But then you had to go
and save your neighbour's life,

212
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:04,566
and then Joe approached you
and you got elected to parliament

213
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:07,046
and we all ended up here
in Lake Shit.

214
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:10,646
Joe Sandilands?

215
00:12:12,326 --> 00:12:15,326
You were working at the brothel
where he got sprung?

216
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:20,206
That's why you were so upset
when he topped himself.

217
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:22,406
You were with him, weren't you?

218
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:24,446
In the past.
I didn't know you then.

219
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:28,366
Oh, my God! Cleaver Greene.
That's how you know him, isn't it?

220
00:12:28,526 --> 00:12:30,886
There was never any cousin Angus.

221
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:33,006
Oh, not him.

222
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:36,246
You mean the whole time
we were together, my whole campaign,

223
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:38,366
he was laughing
his bloody head off?

224
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:39,406
No.

225
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:42,806
Oh, well, you will forgive me
if I don't believe you.

226
00:12:47,806 --> 00:12:49,366
It ends today.

227
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:52,566
Haven't you got a traffic island
to open somewhere?

228
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:55,686
I wouldn't miss it for the world,
I guarantee it.

229
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:09,286
Looking at the financial year 2005-2006,

230
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:13,046
Mr Greene represented
58 clients in court.

231
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:16,206
So I estimated the number of
billing hours he would have taken

232
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:18,246
to prepare each case.

233
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:19,726
Hang on.

234
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:21,926
Your Honour, how could she
possibly estimate that

235
00:13:22,086 --> 00:13:24,326
without knowing the subject matter?

236
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:26,006
If that was an objection,
it was overruled.

237
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:29,326
I read the transcripts
of each case, taking note

238
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:31,086
of the substance of each charge,

239
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:34,286
number of withesses called,
complexity of issues.

240
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:38,046
What could a bean counter know
about complexity of issues?

241
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:40,806
I have found you in contempt
once before.

242
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:43,486
Do you want to play for
another three days in remand?

243
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:44,686
Hm?

244
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:47,006
Then I spoke to 15 barristers

245
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,926
of Mr Greene's
experience and rank...

246
00:13:49,086 --> 00:13:50,446
151

247
00:13:50,606 --> 00:13:52,686
..asked them for their estimates,
then took a mean figure.

248
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:54,166
Very mean.

249
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:58,566
In my estimation, Mr Greene would have
made no less than $238,000

250
00:13:58,726 --> 00:14:00,086
for that year.

251
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:02,846
Were there any legitimate deductibles
during that year?

252
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:05,486
Well, judging by Mr Greene's
credit card statements,

253
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:09,206
most of his money went on
entertainment-related products

254
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:11,086
and two gambling accounts.

255
00:14:11,246 --> 00:14:12,566
He doesn't rent an office.

256
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,166
He occupies the chambers
of people on holiday.

257
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:17,766
Oh, yeah. A floater.

258
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:23,446
He paid $5,200 for a law conference
in Bermagui.

259
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:26,086
What? Never been to Bermagui.

260
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:28,286
I think that is her point.

261
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:32,366
He made several trips there,
but no record of any law conference.

262
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:34,646
I don't even know
where Bermagui is.

263
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:38,406
Having reached the end
of this very long road,

264
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:42,046
this case has given me no joy,

265
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:45,926
but I eagerly await
any submission in mitigation,

266
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:51,526
because at this moment,
I think, Mr Greene,

267
00:14:51,686 --> 00:14:54,726
you have avoided paying
a staggering amount of tax.

268
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:06,166
At worst, and I think
this is where we are...

269
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:10,046
..you have...

270
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,966
Great loss to our profession.

271
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:32,966
I had the very real sense
he was about to find in my favour.

272
00:15:33,126 --> 00:15:37,446
I don't know how,
but you caused this.

273
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:39,246
Oh, I do.

274
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:42,246
I'm the original butterfly.

275
00:15:44,806 --> 00:15:48,846
You are a codling moth,
and I will crush you.

276
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:52,526
You'll have your work cut out
from the opposition backbenches

277
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,366
in state parliament, mate.

278
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:02,086
Bermagui, two weeks.

279
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,646
Bermagui, two weeks.

280
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:08,686
$3,120. When?

281
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,726
$3,487?

282
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:24,486
Bermagui Electrical. $3,487.
Never even been there.

283
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:29,006
Suppose I should
thank you for coming.

284
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:30,726
You don't have to.

285
00:16:32,486 --> 00:16:33,886
Look, I get you're angry with me...

286
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:36,286
We sent napalm to destroy
the North Vietnamese.

287
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:39,886
What did they send in return?
Forensic accountants.

288
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:42,926
The horror. The horror.

289
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:46,006
What do you want?

290
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:49,806
The healing to begin.

291
00:16:51,046 --> 00:16:53,726
I can't stay mad at you.
I'm a weak man.

292
00:16:56,046 --> 00:16:58,806
I can forgive almost anything...
Cleave...

293
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:00,566
No, no, no, listen.

294
00:17:02,126 --> 00:17:05,646
I can forgive the disappearing act,
the reappearing act,

295
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:09,526
the whole hot/cold
English plumbing thing — I get that.

296
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:13,526
What I don't get is why you thought
you had to lie to me.

297
00:17:13,686 --> 00:17:14,526
Cleave...

298
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:17,246
No, no, no, shut up for a minute.
I gotta...I gotta say this.

299
00:17:17,406 --> 00:17:19,166
Oh, great.
I love a unilateral rant.

300
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:24,646
We all need to come from somewhere.

301
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:27,886
My Uncle Kel's New Year's Eve
party trick

302
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:29,726
was hanging his false teeth
off his cock,

303
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:31,886
pretending that Auntie Rena
had bitten him.

304
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:38,366
I didn't want to come from
where I came from.

305
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:40,606
I wanted to try a different life.

306
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:43,046
You can't try a life.
You got to lead an authentic one.

307
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:44,926
Oh, you think your life
is authentic?

308
00:17:45,086 --> 00:17:46,486
Yeah, damn tootin', I do.

309
00:17:46,646 --> 00:17:50,006
Anarchic, catastrophic,
without rhyme or reason,

310
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:54,406
the butterfly, the behemoth,
but fuck me, it's real.

311
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:57,566
An ability to list your flaws doesn't make
it authentic.

312
00:17:57,726 --> 00:18:03,086
What we had was real,
whether you grew up in Peru or Taree.

313
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:04,566
I know that.

314
00:18:04,726 --> 00:18:06,446
And then you end up
with Harry-sorry-David,

315
00:18:06,606 --> 00:18:11,086
a man whose only aspiration's to have
a fucking fountain named after him.

316
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:13,286
That's not true.

317
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:17,806
You should have
given me a chance.

318
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,846
I gave you every chance.
No, no.

319
00:18:20,006 --> 00:18:21,966
Really.

320
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:26,166
I would have loved you

321
00:18:26,326 --> 00:18:30,286
with all the feebleness of my heart.

322
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:34,766
I still do.

323
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:38,766
For all my fucking chaos.

324
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:41,366
We could have been very happy.

325
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:51,886
David and I have split.

326
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:55,566
Wow.

327
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:57,926
I told him the truth.

328
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:03,086
He got both barrels,
the whole bloody grim catastrophe.

329
00:19:03,246 --> 00:19:04,566
And?

330
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,206
And he ran a mile.

331
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:09,446
Unlike you.

332
00:19:11,086 --> 00:19:13,006
So...

333
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:18,046
Wow.

334
00:19:22,846 --> 00:19:24,166
Are you OK?

335
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:25,886
Yeah.
You look a little clammy.

336
00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:27,726
No, I'm good. I'm good.

337
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:30,766
The first glimmer.

338
00:19:30,926 --> 00:19:32,246
What?

339
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:36,766
The first hint of something
barely approaching commitment

340
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,246
and you're terrified.

341
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:39,886
Bullshit.

342
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:44,486
Joe Sandilands said to me
about his marriage

343
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:49,646
that somewhere between passionate sex
against a wall and bin night,

344
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:52,286
everything seemed to get lost.

345
00:19:55,206 --> 00:19:58,806
Call me when you can get past
bin night, Captain Authentic.

346
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:12,806
I can do bin night! Thursday. Right?

347
00:20:21,526 --> 00:20:22,846
Why?

348
00:20:23,006 --> 00:20:29,286
Around $90,000 systematically
stolen from me, under my nose,

349
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:30,766
over eight years

350
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:32,766
by someone
I thought I could trust.

351
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:36,366
Why? Would have thought more.

352
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,366
Really?

353
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:42,286
Yeah. Don't be a smug shit. I took you
out of secretarial college.

354
00:20:42,446 --> 00:20:46,286
I gave you a job. I took care of you.
You had all the time off you wanted.

355
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:50,926
I gave you a salary raise every year.
Surely this warrants some respect.

356
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:54,086
You would have wasted it anyway.
I put 30% of it into my super.

357
00:20:54,246 --> 00:20:57,886
You don't even have that. And the rest
I put towards building a house.

358
00:20:58,046 --> 00:21:00,566
That will employ people
and provide for families.

359
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,966
You can't justify it like that.
This is grand theft.

360
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:07,446
You would have lost it
on the third at Dapto.

361
00:21:07,606 --> 00:21:10,606
Because you don't care about anything,
especially about yourself.

362
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:13,846
You're...you're not
connected to anyone.

363
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,326
You can't even remember
my fiancé's name.

364
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:19,846
How did you manage to conceal this?

365
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:22,526
Ooh, 12 numbered accounts
in the Bahamas.

366
00:21:22,686 --> 00:21:25,086
What do you think, Cleave?
You never check anything.

367
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:27,606
Like I said, you don't...
you don't care.

368
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:29,886
Why Bermagui?

369
00:21:30,046 --> 00:21:31,926
That's where
we're building a house.

370
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:34,766
Oh, so Brian's
in on this too, is he?

371
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:37,166
Bevan.

372
00:21:37,326 --> 00:21:38,446
Bevan.
Bevan.

373
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:41,206
Bevan is in on this too.

374
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,446
This is now a police matter,
you realise?

375
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:44,926
Oh, yeah, right.

376
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:46,566
“Help me, Officer.

377
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:49,526
“The money I cheated from
the Tax Office was stolen from me.”

378
00:21:50,846 --> 00:21:52,686
We haven't finished here!

379
00:21:52,846 --> 00:21:56,486
Your client will be expected
to compensate my client

380
00:21:56,646 --> 00:21:58,726
any money she has invested
in the house

381
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:00,846
plus interest accrued
had that money been in a bank.

382
00:22:01,006 --> 00:22:03,686
Cleaver fucking Greene!

383
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,366
When the hell has any bank
ever paid this much interest?

384
00:22:09,526 --> 00:22:11,686
Charged, yes, but not paid.

385
00:22:13,926 --> 00:22:15,406
Fine.

386
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:16,926
She can have the house.

387
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,766
Let her pay me that number.

388
00:22:18,926 --> 00:22:21,326
Scarlet?
I mean it. It's hers.

389
00:22:21,486 --> 00:22:24,406
- She earns just as much as me.
- No.

390
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,366
No, I don't.

391
00:22:28,526 --> 00:22:29,886
Really?

392
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:32,726
What, you aren't a member
of the New South Wales Bar anymore?

393
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:34,206
No.

394
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:39,326
As of, uh, 9:20 this morning,
I've been suspended.

395
00:22:39,486 --> 00:22:41,446
- Pardon?
- Mmm.

396
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:44,286
Yeah, the Bar Association
are pretty cross with me.

397
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,886
They say I've broken the rule
against cross-examining a friend.

398
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:51,566
Oh, that fucking assault case!

399
00:22:51,726 --> 00:22:54,486
I've tried explaining to them that...
that Cleaver Greene

400
00:22:54,646 --> 00:22:56,846
is not a friend of mine or anyone's,

401
00:22:57,006 --> 00:23:00,846
but they're so adamant that I've
abused my privilege to cross-examine.

402
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:03,046
So how long until
you can practise again?

403
00:23:03,206 --> 00:23:06,206
Well, less the time
from 9:20 this morning, a year.

404
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:08,046
A year.

405
00:23:09,326 --> 00:23:11,006
Nine...nine years at the bar.

406
00:23:11,166 --> 00:23:13,606
I make one mistake, and this,

407
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:16,166
and Cleaver Greene,
with all the shit that he's caused,

408
00:23:16,326 --> 00:23:17,926
he...he still gets to practise.

409
00:23:18,086 --> 00:23:21,966
Yes, this does change things potentially,
considerably.

410
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:24,206
If my client no longer has
a steady income,

411
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:27,166
this poses all sorts of questions about
maintenance and provision.

412
00:23:27,326 --> 00:23:31,526
Yeah, she, uh,
makes a valid point, mate.

413
00:23:31,686 --> 00:23:34,646
You might have to sell your house,
given your current level of debt.

414
00:23:34,806 --> 00:23:36,166
Yes, I know.

415
00:23:36,326 --> 00:23:38,886
You're deep in
the sticky stuff here, Mick.

416
00:23:39,046 --> 00:23:40,886
You're gonna have to give us
something to work with.

417
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:42,726
Well, how about the fact
that you owe me

418
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:44,206
close to 80K in gambling debts?

419
00:23:44,366 --> 00:23:48,446
Get me off this shitbox charge
and watch those debts magically vanish.

420
00:23:48,606 --> 00:23:52,206
And I'll throw in
a $25,000 line of credit.

421
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:54,806
None of this is gonna get you
past the DNA evidence.

422
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:56,406
Cleaver will.

423
00:23:56,566 --> 00:23:59,006
He's a smart fucking boy.
Cleaver won't, mate.

424
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:01,486
They found more of your hair
on the victim's body

425
00:24:01,646 --> 00:24:02,966
than Lassie shed in a lifetime.

426
00:24:03,126 --> 00:24:06,526
I was working out there. Me hair's
probably all over the place.

427
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:10,846
Where were you the night that your
company was laying the concrete?

428
00:24:19,686 --> 00:24:22,366
I was hosting a lifestyle party
at my place.

429
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:26,006
Swinging, OK?

430
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,806
Swingers?

431
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,846
You and Kirsty?

432
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:32,126
Well, we prefer the expression
‘lifestylers', but yeah.

433
00:24:33,606 --> 00:24:37,446
My wife and I like to explore
our sexual boundaries

434
00:24:37,606 --> 00:24:40,206
in a safe environment
amongst like-minded people.

435
00:24:40,366 --> 00:24:41,846
OK.

436
00:24:42,006 --> 00:24:43,886
And then this prick turns up.

437
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:45,686
Nigel Turner?
Yeah.

438
00:24:45,846 --> 00:24:48,646
We met him at another party
a few months before.

439
00:24:48,806 --> 00:24:50,526
And he started stalking us.

440
00:24:50,686 --> 00:24:53,446
He wouldn't take no for an answer.

441
00:24:53,606 --> 00:24:55,446
We weren't interested.

442
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:58,126
Turns out his missus had left him.

443
00:24:58,286 --> 00:25:01,126
And I don't do three-ways
with another bloke,

444
00:25:01,286 --> 00:25:03,646
unless his missus is filming.

445
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:06,726
Yeah, well, you've got to know
your moral limits, don't you?

446
00:25:06,886 --> 00:25:08,206
Yeah.
Yeah.

447
00:25:08,366 --> 00:25:10,966
Anyway, he shows up
pissed and dangerous at our place.

448
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:14,846
And I say, “Sorry, mate.”
And I chuck him out.

449
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:18,886
And he comes back later,
after everyone else has gone,

450
00:25:19,046 --> 00:25:21,206
and pulls a knife on me and Kirsty.

451
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:23,686
And the turd keeps coming.

452
00:25:23,846 --> 00:25:27,726
We crash to the floor
and he falls on his own fucking knife.

453
00:25:27,886 --> 00:25:29,246
Can you believe it?

454
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:31,486
Straight through the fucking heart.
Bang, he's dead.

455
00:25:31,646 --> 00:25:33,606
He killed himself.

456
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:36,966
And did he then chop himself up
into little pieces

457
00:25:37,126 --> 00:25:39,846
and stuff himself
into supermarket bags?

458
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,686
I was scared, and I panicked.

459
00:25:42,846 --> 00:25:46,006
And I didn't want to drag Kirsty through
the embarrassment.

460
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,446
Well, it's gonna be hard
to avoid that now, mate.

461
00:25:48,606 --> 00:25:50,726
Is she prepared to testify
it was self-defence?

462
00:25:50,886 --> 00:25:52,206
Course she will.

463
00:25:52,366 --> 00:25:54,086
She knows what happened.

464
00:25:54,246 --> 00:25:54,286
Thanks, mate.

465
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,606
Thanks, mate.

466
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:58,086
We could use this swinging thing.

467
00:25:58,246 --> 00:26:01,606
Distract the jury,
get 'em to focus on salacious sex.

468
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:03,966
Keep well clear of the facts.

469
00:26:04,126 --> 00:26:07,966
You know, we need his wife up there.
You know he's lying?

470
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:10,006
Not for certain, I don't.

471
00:26:12,246 --> 00:26:13,806
Shout you a sandwich?

472
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:18,366
Scarlet and I are getting divorced.
The house is on the market.

473
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:21,326
And thanks to you,
she hasn't got a job.

474
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:25,126
Well... It wasn't all my fault,
you know.

475
00:26:25,286 --> 00:26:29,086
Don't take this the wrong way.
I'm doing it purely for the money.

476
00:26:29,246 --> 00:26:32,566
I know the world has no meaning
if you two split.

477
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:36,606
Let me deal directly with Nicole.
Make it easier for both of us.

478
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:39,166
Can't. I sacked her.
Yeah, right.

479
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:41,566
I mean it.
She's been stealing from me.

480
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:43,686
From day one, as it turns out.

481
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:46,886
Then there really is
nothing to hang onto, is there?

482
00:27:21,046 --> 00:27:23,406
‘Daily Telegraph'!
Come in, if you must.

483
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,046
Don't know why you bother.

484
00:27:26,206 --> 00:27:29,086
I've already told the police everything.

485
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:32,566
He came back after the party,
he was furious and out of control,

486
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:34,926
they fought, he died, I pissed off.

487
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:39,166
Kirsty, you're the only credible witness
who can back Mick up.

488
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:41,206
It's gonna be difficult for you
on the stand.

489
00:27:41,366 --> 00:27:43,046
Yeah, well, like I haven't
been there before.

490
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:46,766
And are you sure that your statement
covered everything?

491
00:27:48,406 --> 00:27:50,646
How many people do you think
are looking at that and thinking,

492
00:27:50,806 --> 00:27:52,246
“Ooh, I'd love to
have sex with that'?

493
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:54,646
Quite a few, I'm sure.

494
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,766
Mick bought that for me,

495
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,366
told me it covered my flab.

496
00:28:00,526 --> 00:28:02,806
Could you tell me
how the scene works?

497
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:04,286
The scene?

498
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:06,206
The swinger scene.

499
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:09,006
A bit of a voyeur,
are you, Mr Meagher?

500
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,846
Maybe you'd like to take part.

501
00:28:11,006 --> 00:28:13,526
No, that's not why I'm here.
Done worse than you.

502
00:28:13,686 --> 00:28:15,646
I just want to understand.

503
00:28:15,806 --> 00:28:17,486
It's just sex.

504
00:28:17,646 --> 00:28:19,446
There's heaps of different ways.

505
00:28:19,606 --> 00:28:21,966
There's full-swing orgy.

506
00:28:22,126 --> 00:28:24,486
There's full-swing
partner swap.

507
00:28:24,646 --> 00:28:27,006
There's soft swing.
There's soft swap.

508
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:30,966
Well, what's the difference between
soft swing and soft swap?

509
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,766
Sex with your own partner
in front of another couple.

510
00:28:33,926 --> 00:28:35,526
Soft swap is oral permissible.

511
00:28:35,686 --> 00:28:38,006
Oral permissible?

512
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,766
It's just sex, Mr Meagher.

513
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:42,966
I don't see how that can work.

514
00:28:43,126 --> 00:28:47,166
When you've invested everything
you have into your marriage

515
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:50,886
and the two of you
have made this commitment —

516
00:28:51,046 --> 00:28:53,766
you know, you and her,
and your kids, against the world —

517
00:28:53,926 --> 00:28:57,686
doesn't having sex with someone else
destroy that?

518
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:03,846
Well, there's one rule
that you can't break.

519
00:29:04,006 --> 00:29:05,646
What's that?

520
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:08,086
Never get involved.

521
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,286
You can't do that.

522
00:29:13,006 --> 00:29:15,926
So are you confident
that you can testify?

523
00:29:16,086 --> 00:29:18,326
Mick was trying to protect me.

524
00:29:18,486 --> 00:29:21,126
They got into a fight.

525
00:29:21,286 --> 00:29:24,446
Nigel fell on his knife
and he died.

526
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:27,246
And I pissed off.

527
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,686
Nigel?
Yeah.

528
00:29:29,846 --> 00:29:32,246
You called him by his first name.

529
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:34,366
Yeah, well,
that is his name, isn't it?

530
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:38,166
Did Mr Corella explain
why he cut the body up

531
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:41,686
if he was just going to bury it
beneath a concrete slab anyway?

532
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,846
No.

533
00:29:44,006 --> 00:29:45,646
And in your experience,
does this seem consistent

534
00:29:45,806 --> 00:29:48,366
with an act
of spontaneous self-defence,

535
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:51,366
to accidentally kill somebody

536
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:53,846
and then take to their corpse
with a chainsaw?

537
00:29:54,006 --> 00:29:58,246
It is more the sort of behaviour
you would associate with premeditation.

538
00:29:58,406 --> 00:29:59,526
Objection.

539
00:29:59,686 --> 00:30:01,086
Yes, sustained.

540
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:05,006
Please stick to the facts,
both of you.

541
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:08,366
I worked with Nigel for 15 years.

542
00:30:08,526 --> 00:30:12,846
He was a gentle, loving man,
a great dad to Ella,

543
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:15,406
a fantastic contributor
to the Lions Club

544
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:16,966
and our Bowl for Asia appeal.

545
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:20,246
Tell me, in addition to being
a loyal member of the Lions Club,

546
00:30:20,406 --> 00:30:25,206
did you know that your boss
was also a hardcore swinger?

547
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:28,846
No.

548
00:30:29,006 --> 00:30:33,086
I think he was just so lonely
after his divorce.

549
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:36,566
He was looking for love
in the wrong places.

550
00:30:36,726 --> 00:30:39,646
Doesn't make him someone
who deserved to be killed.

551
00:30:39,806 --> 00:30:41,846
No, but it does make him
a very different man

552
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,326
to the man that you
claim to have known.

553
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:46,366
Nothing further, Your Honour.

554
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:03,086
I need to know about
your relationship with Greene.

555
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:05,006
Leave it, David, please.

556
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,926
All those times you disappeared.
No, it wasn't like that.

557
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:09,766
Then tell me how it was!

558
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:12,766
We played a lot of backgammon,
and we laughed,

559
00:31:12,926 --> 00:31:14,846
and all of it was
before I knew you.

560
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,806
You know, when I turned 15,

561
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:18,726
I decided I wanted
to make a difference.

562
00:31:18,886 --> 00:31:21,646
I decided that one day
I would achieve high office

563
00:31:21,806 --> 00:31:23,566
so that I could make a difference.

564
00:31:23,726 --> 00:31:25,646
Since then, I've tried
to live a good life,

565
00:31:25,806 --> 00:31:27,126
to have no blots on my record.

566
00:31:27,286 --> 00:31:30,446
Blots?
You have made me look like a fool.

567
00:31:31,566 --> 00:31:34,246
Nobody needs to know, do they?

568
00:31:36,366 --> 00:31:40,246
I really hope
it turns around for you, David.

569
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:42,086
You deserve it.

570
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:03,566
You here to take
another swing at me, Harry?

571
00:32:08,286 --> 00:32:09,606
Harry?

572
00:32:09,766 --> 00:32:11,886
It was wrong.

573
00:32:12,046 --> 00:32:16,446
Completely out of character.
I'm not thinking clearly.

574
00:32:18,966 --> 00:32:20,566
She takes it out of you,
doesn't she?

575
00:32:20,726 --> 00:32:22,086
I'm in hell.

576
00:32:22,246 --> 00:32:26,206
I know it doesn't mean anything
to people like you, but I loved her.

577
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:27,886
Love her.

578
00:32:29,566 --> 00:32:31,966
Now I don't have a fucking clue
who she is.

579
00:32:33,886 --> 00:32:36,406
Has it occurred to you that
maybe she hasn't got a clue either?

580
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:40,286
I mean, she's spent her whole life being
all things to all people,

581
00:32:40,446 --> 00:32:41,806
you and me included.

582
00:32:41,966 --> 00:32:46,886
Maybe we just like the look
of ourselves in the mirror.

583
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:50,646
I will take you down, Cleaver.

584
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:53,766
Well, I very much look forward
to that, Harry.

585
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:03,246
Almost there.

586
00:33:03,406 --> 00:33:06,206
A truck will come
for the rest of it on Friday.

587
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:09,446
Bye-bye.

588
00:33:09,606 --> 00:33:11,966
Love you guys.

589
00:33:12,126 --> 00:33:13,606
Hm?

590
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:16,326
How's the flat?

591
00:33:17,566 --> 00:33:21,366
Oh, you know that tent
we stayed in, in Hyams?

592
00:33:21,526 --> 00:33:23,046
Smaller.

593
00:33:23,206 --> 00:33:26,686
Uh, we were just about
to have some dinner.

594
00:33:26,846 --> 00:33:30,006
Uh, would you like to join us?

595
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,966
Uh, no, thanks.
I'm catching up with some friends.

596
00:33:32,126 --> 00:33:33,606
Oh.

597
00:33:50,366 --> 00:33:53,366
Spoken to Kirsty yet?
Mmm. Poor woman.

598
00:33:53,526 --> 00:33:57,926
She's sitting on something.
She knew Nigel Turner.

599
00:33:58,086 --> 00:34:00,166
Right, so the prosecution
would chew her up.

600
00:34:00,326 --> 00:34:02,206
In a minute.

601
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:04,806
Is it such a bad thing?

602
00:34:04,966 --> 00:34:09,206
He murdered a man.
He hacked him up into bite-size pieces.

603
00:34:09,366 --> 00:34:11,126
And the bloke he murdered
had a kid.

604
00:34:11,286 --> 00:34:13,366
He was from all accounts
a lovely guy.

605
00:34:13,526 --> 00:34:16,166
Yeah. Unfortunately,
we're being paid to get Mick off.

606
00:34:16,326 --> 00:34:19,086
We are being paid to defend him,
not become him.

607
00:34:19,246 --> 00:34:20,926
You're not seriously suggesting
I call a defence witness

608
00:34:21,086 --> 00:34:22,846
who might incriminate my own client?

609
00:34:23,006 --> 00:34:24,886
Goes against every principle...

610
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:26,566
Well, now, there's
a principle to live by.

611
00:34:26,726 --> 00:34:29,606
Never call a withess
who might actually tell the truth.

612
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:34,846
Uh, yeah, well, my wife and I

613
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:38,086
like to exchange, um,
partners with close friends

614
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:41,726
as a means of, uh,
exploring our sexual boundaries.

615
00:34:41,886 --> 00:34:44,406
Right, and you were
exploring these boundaries

616
00:34:44,566 --> 00:34:46,486
on the night you met Nigel Turner?

617
00:34:46,646 --> 00:34:47,526
Yes.

618
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,006
My partner and I
were new to the scene,

619
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,966
being more into amo...

620
00:34:53,126 --> 00:34:54,606
..ama...

621
00:34:54,766 --> 00:34:56,086
..maxia.

622
00:34:56,246 --> 00:34:57,366
Amo...?

623
00:34:57,526 --> 00:34:59,526
In cars.

624
00:34:59,686 --> 00:35:02,926
This was our first night
in an open situation,

625
00:35:03,086 --> 00:35:08,166
when this maniac burst through
the doors and started coming onto me.

626
00:35:08,326 --> 00:35:09,726
Well, he was only human.
Well, I...

627
00:35:09,886 --> 00:35:11,886
I tell him I'm strictly hetero,

628
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:13,806
but, um,

629
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:16,046
he wouldn't take no for an answer.

630
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:17,526
Right.

631
00:35:17,686 --> 00:35:20,246
And so you would describe Nigel Turner's
behaviour as very dangerous?

632
00:35:20,406 --> 00:35:22,726
My wife and I felt
very vulnerable.

633
00:35:22,886 --> 00:35:25,766
I, personally,
was frightened for my life.

634
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:29,846
All yours.

635
00:35:30,006 --> 00:35:34,566
Aren't you known around the traps
as Mick Corella's enforcer?

636
00:35:34,726 --> 00:35:37,806
Objection, Your Honour.
The witness is not on trial here.

637
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:40,246
Your Honour, it goes to credit.
Tightrope, Mr Gardener.

638
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:42,806
I'll allow it.
I don't work for him anymore.

639
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:48,166
You were the state Muay Thai
boxing champion, I understand.

640
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:49,846
Never beaten.
Yeah.

641
00:35:50,006 --> 00:35:51,686
Six title defences.

642
00:35:51,846 --> 00:35:57,926
And yet we are to believe
you were terrified of this man.

643
00:35:58,086 --> 00:36:00,726
Yeah, well, sometimes
it's the little blokes.

644
00:36:14,966 --> 00:36:17,606
You knocked those off
from the foyer at chambers.

645
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:20,726
Well, you did steal $90,000 from me.

646
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:23,366
I'm not gonna
splash out on you, am I?

647
00:36:23,526 --> 00:36:25,246
Fair enough.

648
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:28,246
So who told you I was here?

649
00:36:28,406 --> 00:36:30,486
Bevan called me.
Oh, you got his name right.

650
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,566
Mmm. Something about
you being attacked by a demon.

651
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:35,646
It was a gargoyle.

652
00:36:35,806 --> 00:36:39,406
What sort of gargoyle?
Oh, I didn't have time to look.

653
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:47,886
Well, you can have your job back
if you like.

654
00:36:48,046 --> 00:36:49,686
Oh, I don't want it.
Yes, you do.

655
00:36:49,846 --> 00:36:51,806
Who else are you
going to work for?

656
00:36:51,966 --> 00:36:55,246
Shiny-suited conveyancing solicitor
in Newtown?

657
00:36:55,406 --> 00:36:58,526
Your marriage is gonna be
boring enough.

658
00:37:00,006 --> 00:37:03,486
Alright, I'll give you a 10% raise.
No.

659
00:37:03,646 --> 00:37:04,966
Jesus.

660
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:08,326
Oh, I'd still charge stuff to you
when you're not looking.

661
00:37:08,486 --> 00:37:11,406
You can't say that!
There's a principle at stake here.

662
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:14,926
Oh, you said once you put
principles and the Easter bunny

663
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:16,726
in the same category.

664
00:37:19,926 --> 00:37:24,086
Alright, you can keep pilfering
from me, but cap it at 5%.

665
00:37:25,486 --> 00:37:28,286
10% and we'll talk.

666
00:38:02,566 --> 00:38:04,126
Missy.

667
00:38:04,286 --> 00:38:06,726
It's bin night.

668
00:38:23,406 --> 00:38:24,726
What?

669
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,446
You've got...stuff.

670
00:38:26,606 --> 00:38:29,606
Yeah, I just grabbed what I could.
I've got a van coming on Monday.

671
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:32,206
Right. A van.

672
00:38:32,366 --> 00:38:35,126
Yeah, you did say bin night,
didn't you?

673
00:38:35,286 --> 00:38:38,006
I did, indeed.

674
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,646
Indeedy I did.

675
00:38:39,806 --> 00:38:43,046
And by ‘bin night',
I meant that we could talk...

676
00:38:43,206 --> 00:38:44,846
I know, but I just thought...

677
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:48,926
We should just move in together
and sort through all our shit as we go.

678
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,566
Right. Very good.

679
00:38:57,726 --> 00:39:00,646
OK, so there's no van coming
on Monday.

680
00:39:00,806 --> 00:39:02,846
No.
Very good.

681
00:39:04,126 --> 00:39:06,566
Oh, I just wanted
to see your face.

682
00:39:09,886 --> 00:39:12,646
I'm leaving. I've deferred uni
and I've booked a flight.

683
00:39:12,806 --> 00:39:14,206
What?

684
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:15,806
Where are you going?

685
00:39:15,966 --> 00:39:19,446
I thought I'd trace the steps
of my dead non-parents.

686
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:21,886
Rome, Florence, Spain.

687
00:39:22,046 --> 00:39:24,966
Greece. Lima.
You can't leave me now.

688
00:39:25,126 --> 00:39:26,646
I'm poised to commit.

689
00:39:26,806 --> 00:39:28,926
It's too late.
It's not.

690
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:30,726
Don't say that.

691
00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:32,726
When are you going?
Tonight.

692
00:39:32,886 --> 00:39:36,446
Oh, for fuck's sake. Missy.
A journey in search of the real me.

693
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:37,926
Waste of time.

694
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:40,846
I promise you, every time
I've tried to find myself,

695
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,646
I've realised
it wasn't worth the trip.

696
00:39:42,806 --> 00:39:45,566
We're this close.

697
00:39:45,726 --> 00:39:47,326
We've always been this close.
No.

698
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:49,926
You're always poised, Cleave.
Listen to me.

699
00:39:50,086 --> 00:39:53,406
I've been in love with you long enough
to know that it's not gonna happen.

700
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:11,206
I could come and find you
in a couple of months.

701
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:15,566
I might be a completely
different person by then.

702
00:40:15,726 --> 00:40:18,806
I'd still love ya.

703
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:55,366
Who the fuck am I gonna
play backgammon with?

704
00:40:55,526 --> 00:40:57,486
Have you thought rationally about that?

705
00:40:57,646 --> 00:40:59,646
Huh?

706
00:40:59,806 --> 00:41:02,686
Come on, let's get a coffee and...
Can't. Have a million things to do.

707
00:41:02,846 --> 00:41:04,686
No, no, just one lousy coffee.
Come on.

708
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,406
- Dario?
- Piccolo, Cleaver?

709
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:12,846
Yeah, and a skinny flat white,
thanks, mate.

710
00:41:13,886 --> 00:41:15,886
And maybe a cake of some s...

711
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:07,046
Have you got any aces up your sleeve?

712
00:42:07,206 --> 00:42:10,046
‘Cause all your swinger mates
are really not cutting it with this jury.

713
00:42:10,206 --> 00:42:13,726
Oh, I never trouble meself too much
about juries, Cleave.

714
00:42:14,846 --> 00:42:16,806
All rise.

715
00:42:39,086 --> 00:42:40,726
Mr Greene.

716
00:42:43,006 --> 00:42:45,126
Mr Greene, your next witness?

717
00:42:47,646 --> 00:42:51,206
Your Honour, I'd like to call, um,
Kirsty Corella, please.

718
00:42:52,646 --> 00:42:57,726
And he attacked us with a knife
and Mick pleaded for him to stop,

719
00:42:57,886 --> 00:42:59,326
but he wouldn't.

720
00:42:59,486 --> 00:43:01,766
You must have been
in terrible fear for your life.

721
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:07,166
So you were absolutely convinced
that Nigel Turner was out of control?

722
00:43:08,646 --> 00:43:10,046
Yeah.
Yes.

723
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:13,566
So let's set the picture
for the jury, then.

724
00:43:13,726 --> 00:43:16,686
This madman bursts into your home,

725
00:43:16,846 --> 00:43:19,606
and he's trying to kill
the man you love.

726
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,566
What happened next?

727
00:43:21,726 --> 00:43:23,126
Um...

728
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:27,166
They...they...they fought,
and he fell on his blade.

729
00:43:27,326 --> 00:43:31,566
I'm sorry, Mrs Corella, I can see
how difficult this is for you,

730
00:43:31,726 --> 00:43:33,086
seeing the man you...

731
00:43:33,246 --> 00:43:35,006
..love and adore

732
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:37,366
now charged with murder

733
00:43:37,526 --> 00:43:41,046
for simply trying to protect you from

734
00:43:41,206 --> 00:43:45,006
this venomous monster.

735
00:43:46,726 --> 00:43:50,366
This gentle, loving man,

736
00:43:50,526 --> 00:43:54,086
who married you for better or worse,

737
00:43:54,246 --> 00:43:58,926
who shared your most intimate moments
but still allowed you the freedom

738
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:03,206
to explore your sexuality
with loads of other men

739
00:44:03,366 --> 00:44:06,446
whilst remaining
emotionally committed.

740
00:44:06,606 --> 00:44:10,126
He f... He fell on his knife.

741
00:44:10,286 --> 00:44:12,686
Yes, surely a fitting conclusion

742
00:44:12,846 --> 00:44:17,126
for this depraved degenerate.

743
00:44:20,646 --> 00:44:22,606
Nigel never did anything to you.

744
00:44:22,766 --> 00:44:26,086
He was kind and he was warm.

745
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:29,126
Uh, no further questions.
Thank you, Your Honour.

746
00:44:29,286 --> 00:44:31,846
He brought me flowers.

747
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:35,486
And he held my hand.

748
00:44:35,646 --> 00:44:39,086
And he told me how pretty I was.

749
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:42,406
And it didn't matter to him
that my legs were a bit fat,

750
00:44:42,566 --> 00:44:45,366
and he loved me for who I am.

751
00:44:45,526 --> 00:44:47,006
Thank you, Your Honour.
That will be all.

752
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:50,126
And he didn't make me
strap on a giant rubber dildo

753
00:44:50,286 --> 00:44:53,926
and do unnatural things,
and you killed him, you monster!

754
00:44:56,206 --> 00:44:58,006
She was seeing him
behind me back.

755
00:45:00,566 --> 00:45:02,086
So I had 'em tailed.

756
00:45:04,926 --> 00:45:06,446
They went for walks

757
00:45:06,606 --> 00:45:08,286
and held hands.

758
00:45:11,726 --> 00:45:14,526
He took her to the bookshop
at the fucking museum.

759
00:45:15,886 --> 00:45:17,406
My wife.

760
00:45:18,566 --> 00:45:21,366
You did let her
have sex with other men.

761
00:45:21,526 --> 00:45:23,646
Yeah, but not going
to fucking bookshops.

762
00:45:23,806 --> 00:45:26,726
He was being intimate with my wife.

763
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:30,166
And the prick had to fucking die.

764
00:45:36,846 --> 00:45:38,806
Hello, monkeys.

765
00:45:38,966 --> 00:45:40,366
We're not monkeys!

766
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:48,046
The Chinese drawers were mine.

767
00:45:48,206 --> 00:45:51,286
No, they were given to us
by my mother.

768
00:45:51,446 --> 00:45:53,966
Oh, oh! So that's how
you want to play this?

769
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,566
OK. OK, well, why don't we
go through everything again, hm?

770
00:45:56,726 --> 00:45:59,326
What's in that box?
Look, I don't know what's in there.

771
00:45:59,486 --> 00:46:01,926
Oh, well, it's got your name on it.
You packed it.

772
00:46:02,086 --> 00:46:03,406
Oh, look.

773
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:05,846
Why don't we have a little
look-see, hey? Have a look.

774
00:46:06,006 --> 00:46:08,766
Help yourself.
Let's see what else we can have.

775
00:46:08,926 --> 00:46:11,486
And have a look in this one!
There we go!

776
00:46:11,646 --> 00:46:14,166
You're just being stupid now.
I've smashed the ersatz Deco clock!

777
00:46:14,326 --> 00:46:19,206
What a shame! You know what?
Take it all. Have...have it all.

778
00:46:19,366 --> 00:46:22,606
It's shit! It's just fucking shit!

779
00:46:22,766 --> 00:46:26,086
Have every last...
Yours! It's shit!

780
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:28,526
Take your fucking sh... Have it!

781
00:47:14,006 --> 00:47:15,486
Hi.

782
00:47:26,766 --> 00:47:28,326
Hi. Um...

783
00:47:40,606 --> 00:47:42,606
Are you sure you want this?

784
00:47:47,606 --> 00:47:49,126
Um...

785
00:47:52,046 --> 00:47:56,366
Do you have the faintest clue
how much I love you?

786
00:48:19,766 --> 00:48:22,686
It's a classic anxiety attack.
He's been in there for over a day now.

787
00:48:22,846 --> 00:48:25,766
Used to get 'em when I was a kid.
Good.

788
00:48:25,926 --> 00:48:27,966
Then you can tell him
how you got out of it.

789
00:48:28,126 --> 00:48:30,246
I will. Booze and drugs.

790
00:48:52,326 --> 00:48:54,086
If you're gonna live in here
permanently, mate,

791
00:48:54,246 --> 00:48:55,926
I can organise some plumbing.

792
00:48:56,086 --> 00:48:58,446
I'll come out soon.

793
00:49:00,046 --> 00:49:02,606
I'm shit at everything, Dad.

794
00:49:02,766 --> 00:49:05,646
I'm shit at school.
I'm shit at sport.

795
00:49:05,806 --> 00:49:07,286
I'm shit at making friends.

796
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:10,686
And I know you and Mum
want me to be special, but I'm not.

797
00:49:10,846 --> 00:49:12,606
I'm just ordinary.

798
00:49:12,766 --> 00:49:14,806
Ordinary people don't spend two days
in cupboards, mate.

799
00:49:14,966 --> 00:49:17,766
Fiona was the only person
that made me feel

800
00:49:17,926 --> 00:49:20,006
like things were
gonna be OK in the future.

801
00:49:22,166 --> 00:49:24,406
I love her, Dad.

802
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,926
Oh, you gotta love 'em, son.

803
00:49:28,086 --> 00:49:30,486
No point if you don't.

804
00:49:30,646 --> 00:49:32,846
Well, you didn't love Mum.

805
00:49:33,006 --> 00:49:35,166
I loved her most of all.

806
00:49:35,326 --> 00:49:40,646
But you don't give me any hope
that things can get better.

807
00:49:41,806 --> 00:49:45,206
Everyone's always out of control
in your life.

808
00:49:45,366 --> 00:49:48,526
And if you can't manage to be happy
with everything that you've got,

809
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:50,766
how's anyone with nothing
going to make it?

810
00:49:50,926 --> 00:49:54,846
Chaos eventually finds its own level,
and more often than not,

811
00:49:55,006 --> 00:49:57,126
it's in a better place than it was
when it started,

812
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:59,326
and it'll be the same
for you too, Fuzz.

813
00:49:59,486 --> 00:50:02,126
I guarantee it, my friend, because...

814
00:50:02,286 --> 00:50:04,286
You're wrong.

815
00:50:04,446 --> 00:50:09,246
You are about
the most special person I know.

816
00:50:16,886 --> 00:50:18,326
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

817
00:50:20,006 --> 00:50:22,126
Hey, Cleave.
Hope I'm not disturbing you.

818
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:25,326
Look, I've, um, been sent round
to give you a bit of a hiding.

819
00:50:25,486 --> 00:50:28,806
What are you talking about?
Mick's gone away for 25 years.

820
00:50:28,966 --> 00:50:31,166
No, no, it's for Kirsty.
She's taken over the reins now.

821
00:50:31,326 --> 00:50:33,406
Very easy to work for, I might add.
Oh, good.

822
00:50:33,566 --> 00:50:36,086
Look, she reckons that even with
all the legals for Mick,

823
00:50:36,246 --> 00:50:38,246
you're still about 38K in the hole.

824
00:50:38,406 --> 00:50:41,006
You are fucking kidding me.
It's a matter of principle, Cleave.

825
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:43,446
Yeah, isn't it always?
What, is now a good time?

826
00:50:43,606 --> 00:50:46,126
Well, no, not really, mate.

827
00:50:46,286 --> 00:50:47,606
But...

828
00:50:47,766 --> 00:50:50,046
Look, if you're gonna do it,
do it over the lino.

829
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:52,446
At least it'll be easy to mop up.
Righto.

830
00:51:07,046 --> 00:51:10,006
Thought you and I should celebrate
losing our biggest client.

831
00:51:11,686 --> 00:51:13,806
But perhaps you should
go to hospital.

832
00:51:15,006 --> 00:51:19,526
No, it's just a...
light dusting, mate.

833
00:51:25,086 --> 00:51:27,046
Fancy a game of backgammon?

834
00:51:28,526 --> 00:51:30,726
You know I'm strictly a chess man.

835
00:51:30,886 --> 00:51:32,526
Well...

836
00:51:32,686 --> 00:51:34,326
We've all got... Ow!

837
00:51:34,486 --> 00:51:35,846
Oh, shit.

838
00:51:36,006 --> 00:51:38,046
We've all got to adapt, mate.
You know?

839
00:51:38,206 --> 00:51:41,886
You and I are entering
a new era of enlightenment.

840
00:51:50,886 --> 00:51:53,926
Oh. See, Missy would
never have done that.

841
00:51:55,446 --> 00:52:00,246
Oh, please! I can't see the board,
dripping blood all over it.

842
00:52:00,406 --> 00:52:02,926
Oh, well, I apologise
for my subdural haematoma

843
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:04,646
inconveniencing you, mate.

844
00:52:04,806 --> 00:52:06,926
So I should hope.
Do you need a cloth?

845
00:52:07,086 --> 00:52:09,606
Well... No, no,
I'm fine, thanks, mate, yeah.

846
00:52:09,766 --> 00:52:11,486
I'll get it, then, shall 1?
All good here.

847
00:52:11,646 --> 00:52:13,966
No, no, I'll go get you a cloth.
Oh, thanks very much.

848
