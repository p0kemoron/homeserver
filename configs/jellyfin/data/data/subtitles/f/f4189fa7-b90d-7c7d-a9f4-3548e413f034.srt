1
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:07,166
Andre!

2
00:01:08,686 --> 00:01:10,286
Andre!

3
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:13,046
Hello! How's the future
of the family name?

4
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,046
Good.

5
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:17,486
Did you take care of Michaela, Eric
and Mama while I was away?

6
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:20,606
Yes. They're all dead!
I killed them.

7
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:23,726
Good boy. But don't forget to move
your bike away when it stops raining.

8
00:01:23,886 --> 00:01:25,206
Somebody else might get killed.

9
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:27,886
OK, OK!

10
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:31,206
Look at you! Look at you.

11
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:34,086
It's only been three days
and you're more beautiful.

12
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:35,926
Yeah, look, there's two men
from the police

13
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:37,726
that are here to see you, my love.

14
00:01:37,886 --> 00:01:39,566
What about?
I don't know.

15
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:41,406
Some misunderstanding, I think.

16
00:01:42,806 --> 00:01:44,126
Come on to Daddy.

17
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:46,366
Come to Daddy. Come on.

18
00:01:46,526 --> 00:01:48,126
Mr Dana. Hello.

19
00:01:48,286 --> 00:01:50,606
I'm Detective Turner.
This is Detective Bradbury.

20
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:53,406
Gentlemen.
You're welcome in my home.

21
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:55,926
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. I wonder whether we...

22
00:01:56,086 --> 00:01:57,726
I'm a big fan, by the way.

23
00:01:57,886 --> 00:02:00,606
I think I've cooked everything from
your ‘Clean Taste, Clean Life' book.

24
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:02,606
Oh! You flatter me.

25
00:02:02,766 --> 00:02:07,606
Yes, there's a certain
situation in the Blue Mountains.

26
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:09,926
Uh, I believe you own
a restaurant there.

27
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:11,526
My husband owns
the BEST restaurant there.

28
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:13,366
I can vouch for that.
I've eaten there.

29
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:16,766
I had the lamb ris-arto
with a red wine jus

30
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:19,206
and my wife had the, uh, schpitz-el.

31
00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:22,086
I have two restaurants —
one there and one in Surry Hills.

32
00:02:22,246 --> 00:02:24,686
She still talks about the schpitz-el.
Both restaurants have hats.

33
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:26,926
That's good.
They'll have warm heads.

34
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:32,206
Um, anyway, what we're trying
to determine is...

35
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:34,526
And he's opening another one
in Newcastle.

36
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:37,446
A delicate situation has...
Gentlemen, excuse me.

37
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:40,086
It's been a long drive.
May I have a moment to freshen up?

38
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:42,006
Mmm, of course.

39
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,006
Enjoy.

40
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:46,206
Mmm! Oh, it's great cake,
by the way.

41
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:48,206
Uh, torte, yes.
Mmm.

42
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:51,486
He uses wild aniseed.
Ooh, that'd be it, then.

43
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:53,406
Have some more.
Oh, yes, please.

44
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:54,886
God!
Come on.

45
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:56,286
Do you cook?
Oh, well...

46
00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:58,646
He's bolting.

47
00:02:58,806 --> 00:03:01,566
Ow!

48
00:03:01,726 --> 00:03:03,206
Oh! Oh! Oh!

49
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:05,526
Mr Dana.

50
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,326
You right there?

51
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:10,326
We're placing you under arrest.
What is going on here?

52
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:13,126
My husband is a saint!

53
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:15,246
Are you alright?

54
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:18,286
Sonia, whatever happens,

55
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:22,246
you know that I love you as much now
as I did the day I married you.

56
00:03:22,406 --> 00:03:24,686
You are my light.

57
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:26,326
Sonia.

58
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:32,686
What will become of us all,
Mr Wizard?

59
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:40,710
http://hiqve.com/

60
00:04:42,646 --> 00:04:44,366
“..abdomen was ruptured
by the gunman.”

61
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:47,766
See? I told you. He's a hero.

62
00:04:47,926 --> 00:04:49,766
Says so in caps.

63
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:54,726
Point-blank range.
How did the guy miss?

64
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:56,686
Looks like he'll be back on his feet

65
00:04:56,846 --> 00:05:00,686
and bankrupting certain tax cheats
any minute now.

66
00:05:00,846 --> 00:05:03,926
You're on page five.

67
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:08,246
“Faces tribunal for
a record ninth time.

68
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:11,846
“Behaviour of such sustained
and questionable nature

69
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:14,006
“drags the legal profession
into disrepute.”

70
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,646
Oh, does it give an actual date when
the legal profession was IN repute?

71
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:21,286
They're taking bets around here.
5 to 4 they disbar you.

72
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,006
I gotinitat3to1.

73
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,566
Ah!
I've got a wedding to pay for.

74
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,966
Right, yeah.

75
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:29,766
Bevan.
Bevan.

76
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,766
Where are you going?
Time to clear my good name.

77
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:39,446
Thank you, Kylie. Lovely.

78
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,366
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you. Thanks.

79
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:43,846
You know Tammy.

80
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:45,886
Not nearly as well as he should.

81
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:48,286
He was always with Missy.

82
00:05:48,446 --> 00:05:51,686
Tammy, I need you to go with Cleave
for a couple of hours.

83
00:05:51,846 --> 00:05:53,766
Anything in particular
that you want me to work on?

84
00:05:53,926 --> 00:05:56,526
Yes, actually. Very particular.

85
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,406
It's not gonna be a pleasant task.

86
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:03,246
Well, he's brought this on himself.
Yeah, exactly.

87
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:07,766
We don't feel comfortable
about this, Cleave.

88
00:06:07,926 --> 00:06:09,646
Very uncomfortable, in fact.

89
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:11,406
But our hands are tied.

90
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:13,766
Since when is it a breach of ethics
to root a client?

91
00:06:13,926 --> 00:06:16,446
Everyone's doing it.
It's hardly news.

92
00:06:16,606 --> 00:06:19,726
“Barrister fucks client.
24 tomorrow, and sunny.”

93
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:21,206
Ninth appearance, mate —

94
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:23,806
cocaine charges,
contempt, unpaid fines.

95
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,006
I know, I know.

96
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,486
And still facing tax charges.
Now this.

97
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:31,886
It's my cock-up and I have to learn
to live with it.

98
00:06:32,046 --> 00:06:33,566
I don't blame anyone but myself.

99
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,246
It's good to hear you say that.

100
00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:37,806
We are all accountable
for our own actions, hmm?

101
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,326
You're right.

102
00:06:39,486 --> 00:06:43,046
I think both of you know
my new assistant, don't you?

103
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:44,526
Tammy?

104
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:46,526
Hi, Dennie. Hey, Johnny.

105
00:06:56,366 --> 00:06:59,166
Whoo!

106
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:04,206
Whoo-hoo!

107
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:08,126
Whilst not condoning these actions
in any way, shape or form...

108
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:09,806
Not for a moment, no.

109
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:12,046
..the evidence remains,
at best, murky.

110
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:14,726
And while this committee shares
considerable concern

111
00:07:14,886 --> 00:07:16,646
about your eccentricities,

112
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:18,246
we would be loath...

113
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:19,486
Most loath.

114
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:22,966
..to blight a career that has been
known for its service to justice.

115
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:28,406
Barney's in your office.

116
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:30,006
What, you just let him
wander in there?

117
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,486
He has a brief for you.

118
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:34,326
Why didn't he email it?
I don't know. You could ask him.

119
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:35,806
What, did you bother to inquire

120
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,526
whether he'd made an appointment
to see me?

121
00:07:37,686 --> 00:07:39,206
No. No-one makes appointments
with you.

122
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:41,046
It would be a total waste
of everyone's time.

123
00:07:41,206 --> 00:07:42,166
You'd forget them.

124
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:44,166
And even if you remembered,
you'd fail to keep them

125
00:07:44,326 --> 00:07:46,086
because you suddenly decided
you needed to gamble

126
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:49,446
or attend some sort of blood sport.

127
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:52,286
Barney's your best friend
and he looks miserable

128
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:54,126
and I am bringing him a cup of tea.

129
00:07:54,286 --> 00:07:56,646
Miserable? Not angry?

130
00:07:56,806 --> 00:07:59,606
No. Just miserable.
Good.

131
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:04,286
Good.

132
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:07,086
Here.
Barnyard!

133
00:08:07,246 --> 00:08:09,206
Dropping off a brief for you.

134
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:10,926
Thanks, mate.

135
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:12,526
Have you seen Scarlet?

136
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:17,286
Uh, is that a general
or a specific question?

137
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:20,046
Yes, I've seen her.
No, I haven't seen her recently.

138
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:23,926
I've been having my gonads
charcoal-roasted.

139
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:29,206
Oh, God! The committee.
I forgot. Sorry.

140
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:31,006
Don't apologise.

141
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,486
She didn't come home last night.

142
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:34,966
She hasn't called.

143
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:36,726
She's probably at
her sister's, mate.

144
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:38,446
Yeah, sure.

145
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:41,446
Feel like my guts have been
ripped out by grappling hooks.

146
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:42,606
Drink your tea.

147
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,966
What's the name of
that mate of yours

148
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:50,166
that we used on the Collings case,
Martin someone?

149
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:53,486
Oh, no, mate, you don't want
a private dick, believe me.

150
00:08:53,646 --> 00:08:55,206
No, Simon Martin.
I'll get you his card.

151
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:56,686
He doesn't need one.

152
00:08:56,846 --> 00:09:00,046
Look, mate, if there is another he,
and I can guarantee you there isn't,

153
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,526
he's not the problem.

154
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:03,086
He'll be a good part of it.

155
00:09:03,246 --> 00:09:06,366
You wanna just go and have a look at
my appointments for the day?

156
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,646
Just talk to her, mate.

157
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:14,526
In a general way.
Don't get bogged down in detail.

158
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:18,286
What if she has found
someone better? Kinder?

159
00:09:18,446 --> 00:09:20,606
More giving?

160
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:22,486
Able to properly love her?

161
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:25,806
I can guarantee you she hasn't.

162
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,366
I didn't want to involve you.

163
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,526
But you've known us both forever.

164
00:09:32,646 --> 00:09:34,246
You know what she means to me.

165
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:40,446
Barnyard, she'll come back, mate.

166
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:44,846
Yeah.

167
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:50,966
Here's that brief.

168
00:09:51,126 --> 00:09:53,406
You'll love this one.

169
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:56,726
A couple of silks
were sniffing all over it,

170
00:09:56,886 --> 00:10:00,766
but I guaranteed them that you were
the only man in Sydney to handle it.

171
00:10:09,926 --> 00:10:12,286
Hey, Cleave. Tell us
what's happening, mate.

172
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,806
Oh, guys, just here
for a cheeseburger.

173
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:15,486
Come on, mate.
We've been here all day.

174
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:18,206
Ah, Cleave Greene to see George Dana.

175
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:21,846
I look into my Sonia's eyes.
What do I see?

176
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:25,726
I see the small village I used to go
for holidays with my family

177
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:27,606
in the Tyrolean mountains.

178
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:29,166
Table number six!

179
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:32,326
There was a softness there,
but there's also fire.

180
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:35,766
Never mistake her softness for
an absence of passion.

181
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,246
She's a very passionate woman.

182
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:38,926
Our lovemaking is as joyous

183
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:43,286
as it can only be when a couple
has truly committed to each other.

184
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,766
But therein lies the rub, doesn't it?

185
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:48,246
More rosemary.
Yeah, I suppose.

186
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:49,886
You are up on bigamy charges.

187
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:53,606
It's because at the same time as
being married to the Tyrolean Village

188
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:54,766
for 11 years,

189
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:57,446
you've also been married to
Monique Charver for six years.

190
00:10:57,606 --> 00:11:01,406
Six very, very happy years,
let me tell you that much.

191
00:11:01,566 --> 00:11:02,886
Monique is like a truffle.

192
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:04,886
Table number seven!

193
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:09,366
She's so hard to find.
So...so delicious, you know?

194
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:10,846
I'm sure she is.

195
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:14,686
But she's a very pissed off little
truffle at the moment, isn't she?

196
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:18,726
Oh, I guess I have made
both my wives so sad.

197
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,126
Is that duck?

198
00:11:22,286 --> 00:11:23,126
Yeah.

199
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:25,326
And keep moving!

200
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:27,126
Here he comes.
Here he is.

201
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,326
Hey, Mr Potter.
Hello, Mr Potter.

202
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:33,046
Hello. I want you beside me.

203
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:34,526
No, no, no. This is your moment.

204
00:11:34,686 --> 00:11:36,126
Are you enjoying your hero status?

205
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:38,206
I don't really consider myself a hero.

206
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:41,886
I just did what any normal person
would do, given the situation.

207
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:44,246
Would you do it again?
Yes, I would do it again.

208
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:46,206
Yes, uh, thank you very much. Nurse!

209
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:47,926
Did you enjoy your stay
in the hospital?

210
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:51,726
No, I'd rather stay in a hotel
next time, I think. Thank you.

211
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:53,206
Thank you, Mr Potter. Thanks.

212
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:58,806
I'm married to each one of them
separately in my heart.

213
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:02,446
Each one of them is
an equal part of my life.

214
00:12:02,606 --> 00:12:04,846
That's still equally against the law.

215
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:07,926
This rabbit business — fantastic.

216
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:09,766
I Stufato.

217
00:12:09,926 --> 00:12:11,406
An apprentice could do it.

218
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,766
How have you managed to conceal this
for six years?

219
00:12:13,926 --> 00:12:15,366
No-one ever asked.

220
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:18,886
I have two restaurants, a new one
coming. I'm always between them.

221
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:21,446
Is there a chance you might've
thought that your first marriage

222
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:23,886
was technically not a marriage?

223
00:12:24,046 --> 00:12:25,606
No. Why?

224
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:28,166
Why didn't you just divorce
the Tyrolean Village?

225
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:32,646
I gave her a solemn oath before God.

226
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:34,726
Then why didn't you take the truffle
as your mistress?

227
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:37,006
She wanted a proper marriage,

228
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,886
in a proper church,
with all the trimmings.

229
00:12:39,046 --> 00:12:40,046
No, no, no! No, no.

230
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:44,446
Monique is a devout Catholic.

231
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:47,886
I have a suspicion that bigamy
isn't a big winner with the Pope.

232
00:12:48,046 --> 00:12:52,046
My understanding was that he prefers
marriage over infidelity.

233
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:55,086
Well, the law in this country
prefers infidelity.

234
00:12:55,246 --> 00:13:00,966
Did either wife have some sort
of life-threatening illness

235
00:13:01,126 --> 00:13:03,366
that would've been exacerbated
by divorce?

236
00:13:04,606 --> 00:13:07,806
Both exceptionally fit women.

237
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:12,766
Listen, you can go to prison for this.

238
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,486
No way!

239
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:16,046
I cannot go to prison.

240
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:18,606
I have responsibilities to my wives,
my children, my restaurants...

241
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:22,446
George, you're a chef.
Throw me a bone.

242
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,046
I love them.

243
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:29,566
No, no, no. No, no, no.

244
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,286
Law takes a very dim view of love,
mate.

245
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,726
I'm gonna need some happy snaps
of you and your kids.

246
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:38,686
As many as you've got.

247
00:13:41,726 --> 00:13:43,846
How do I face them?

248
00:13:44,006 --> 00:13:45,686
This is huge.

249
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:49,206
How are you guys off for
lightly chillied soft-shell crab

250
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:53,806
nestled on a bowl of pernod-infused
buckwheat noodles?

251
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,646
Move in with me.

252
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:58,406
What?!

253
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:00,766
David, you're crazy.
You hardly know me.

254
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:05,286
No, I wanna be surrounded by
female skin unctions

255
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:07,686
and pantihose over the shower rail.

256
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:10,846
And photos — you know, I don't even
know what your family looks like.

257
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:12,606
They look like
everyone else's family.

258
00:14:12,766 --> 00:14:14,486
Not if they had you as a daughter.

259
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:21,286
I'll stay until you're well.
No promises.

260
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:25,326
A wound like this could take
a lifetime to heal.

261
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:39,646
It was a mistake.

262
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:43,446
Really?

263
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:45,086
Hmm.

264
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:49,886
And here I was saying to myself what
a well-thought-out plan it was.

265
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:51,966
I'm sorry.

266
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:55,246
I was there too.

267
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:08,086
Why do we always come back
to this place?

268
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:12,686
We had our chance a thousand
years ago at uni and we blew it.

269
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:16,126
No, actually, YOU blew it.

270
00:15:16,286 --> 00:15:18,766
And the last time we made love...

271
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:20,526
You weren't married to Barney.

272
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,686
Yeah, but I was in a relationship
with someone else.

273
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:29,166
I could put that down to having a
cement bag of coke up our nostrils.

274
00:15:30,246 --> 00:15:32,446
But last night was different.

275
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:35,606
So that's how
we evaluate romance now, is it?

276
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:38,566
The ability to have sex
without drugs?

277
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:40,686
Hmm. Maybe it is.

278
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:44,926
Cleaver, I do really want...

279
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:50,086
Barney is the only decent man I know.
We cannot do this to him.

280
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:52,166
I'm not in love with Barney.

281
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,406
You have to be in love with him.

282
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:56,086
You must.

283
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:59,286
And even if you're not, try.

284
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:02,566
Because he...he fucking loves you

285
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:07,966
and 93% of the world lives with
people they don't even care about.

286
00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:10,726
Are you sure this is what you want?

287
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:16,566
I won't forget last night.

288
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:20,406
Please try.

289
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:14,046
Remember that bloke at our wedding?

290
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:16,446
I think he was your cousin.

291
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:19,686
He removed his teeth and whistled
‘I Did It My Way'.

292
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:23,526
Joel.
He was a bit simple.

293
00:17:23,686 --> 00:17:25,006
Joel.

294
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:28,806
And everyone laughed at
the poor bastard.

295
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,526
Except you.

296
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:34,206
You got up and you sang
right along with him.

297
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:42,206
Is it really so awful living with me?

298
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:52,046
I'm dying here, Barney.

299
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:54,526
I want a different life.

300
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:59,006
I want a...
I want a break from the law.

301
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,646
Maybe go back to my painting.

302
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:06,406
Eight months ago, we made love in
a riverbed in the Northern Territory

303
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:11,086
and you said this was
the happiest you'd ever been.

304
00:18:12,086 --> 00:18:13,686
Did 1?

305
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:20,606
Are you sure you aren't just
constructing all this in your head

306
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,526
to give you a reason to leave

307
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:24,966
so you can run off
and have your little affair?

308
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:26,846
Mum, Mum!

309
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,406
I got three gold stars for
spelling ‘tyrannosaurus'.

310
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:30,886
Can you spell it?

311
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:33,166
Uh...uh, T...

312
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:34,646
No, I-T.

313
00:18:34,806 --> 00:18:36,526
Oh!

314
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:41,206
3:30 in the morning, I'm watching
this doco on the nature channel.

315
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:44,126
Right, so I take it the sleeping
thing's still not happening for you?

316
00:18:44,286 --> 00:18:47,406
I just bought this knife that can
cut through frozen meat and cars

317
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:48,886
and you never have to sharpen it.

318
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:53,166
And I'm thinking, rather than watch
another infotainment program,

319
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:56,446
spend another 195 bucks on
another useless piece of shit,

320
00:18:56,606 --> 00:18:58,286
probably safer to watch
the nature channel.

321
00:18:58,446 --> 00:19:00,766
Do you want to sit down?
No, I'm fine.

322
00:19:00,926 --> 00:19:04,446
And, um, they're playing this doco
on chimpanzees

323
00:19:04,606 --> 00:19:09,606
which are, according to this show,
98.7% us.

324
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:13,286
There's this 1.3% genetic disparity

325
00:19:13,446 --> 00:19:16,286
that has something to do with our
ability to program DVD players.

326
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,566
But essentially,
they are us and we are them.

327
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:19,646
OK.

328
00:19:19,806 --> 00:19:21,766
Do you know how chimps live?

329
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:26,166
The females hang about in a circle
picking fleas off each other

330
00:19:26,326 --> 00:19:30,326
and worrying that young Bobo's
getting in with the wrong crowd

331
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:34,006
and wishing their anal skin was
as red and swollen as Hilda's.

332
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,726
Do you know what the males are doing?

333
00:19:35,886 --> 00:19:37,566
Boring the crap
out of their ex-wives?

334
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:40,406
They're waiting for the babes
to go on heat.

335
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:43,806
And when they do, it is war.

336
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:46,726
The alpha male tries to beat
the betas off,

337
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,206
but in the end, he either manages to

338
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:51,366
or someone better-looking
takes over the pack

339
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:52,966
and the betas just go back

340
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:55,686
to watching the females pick fleas
off each other.

341
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:57,566
OK, I'm guessing,
buried beneath all this,

342
00:19:57,726 --> 00:19:59,046
is some epiphany on your part.

343
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:00,966
We don't live how we're meant to.

344
00:20:02,926 --> 00:20:06,086
This is why humankind
is in so much trouble.

345
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,046
Fuzz, your father's here!

346
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:10,486
You marry and are expected
to stay faithful to one woman

347
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:11,966
for the rest of our lives,

348
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:14,646
no matter how earth-shatteringly dull
that might be.

349
00:20:14,806 --> 00:20:18,606
But 98.7% of our DNA's telling us
we're morons.

350
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:22,126
There's 1.3%,
the DVD-programming part,

351
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:24,326
telling us we're doing
the right thing.

352
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:29,886
Did something happened this week?

353
00:20:31,686 --> 00:20:33,726
I fucked my best friend's wife.

354
00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:35,286
You fucked Scarlet?!

355
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:39,366
Oh, shit, Cleaver! How could you?

356
00:20:40,726 --> 00:20:42,646
I didn't really mean to.

357
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:47,446
Oh, God! Poor Barney. Poor Scarlet!

358
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:48,926
Oh, well, I didn't do it by myself.

359
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:51,086
Why on earth would you
do a thing like that?

360
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:56,526
I think my percentage chimp DNA
is higher than others.

361
00:21:02,486 --> 00:21:08,646
O Heaven, that such companions
thou'ldst unfold

362
00:21:08,806 --> 00:21:11,086
And put in every honest hand a whip

363
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:15,126
To lash the rascals naked
through the world.

364
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:16,606
Terrific.

365
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:18,486
You can remember
Shakespearean quotes

366
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:21,126
but you need Mum to remind you
when my birthday is.

367
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:22,886
Why do you think that is?

368
00:21:23,046 --> 00:21:24,766
So you get a present.

369
00:21:24,926 --> 00:21:27,926
How's the new love of your life?
She's great.

370
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:31,606
She's in your English class, yeah?

371
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:34,206
Yep. She's into Shakespeare too.

372
00:21:34,366 --> 00:21:38,566
Hmm. Hence the sudden interest.
Maybe.

373
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:43,926
So... ..“To understand
the character of lago,

374
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:46,566
“first you need to define
a bad man.”

375
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:48,206
Alright.

376
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:51,086
Someone who...

377
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:57,166
Someone who wilfully,
with premeditation

378
00:21:57,326 --> 00:22:00,086
and clear understanding of
their actions

379
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:02,206
and the weight of their consequence

380
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:05,206
commits injury anyway.

381
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:07,926
Good. That's exactly what lago does.

382
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:09,406
Ruins Othello's life

383
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:12,046
and the whole time
he's pretending he's his best mate.

384
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,926
Who is this prick?

385
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:17,566
No, lago's a much more complex
character than that.

386
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:20,806
His reasons are
psychological and nuanced.

387
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:24,206
No, he just wants something that's
not his, and fuck everyone else.

388
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:28,246
No, that's a stupidly reductive
reading of the script, my friend.

389
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:30,606
You're an hour late for school.
Come on.

390
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:39,726
Mmm, mmm.

391
00:22:39,886 --> 00:22:41,246
Oh.

392
00:22:41,406 --> 00:22:43,486
Mmm, mmm.

393
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:46,926
Ah! It's building.

394
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:48,846
Have you spoken to Sonia,
the first wife?

395
00:22:49,006 --> 00:22:51,846
Doesn't wanna know. Subpoena her?

396
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:53,526
Try and have a chat first.

397
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:57,166
Wife number two wants to melt
his balls and wear them as earrings.

398
00:22:57,326 --> 00:22:58,886
You can't blame her.

399
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:02,326
Why don't you go and lavish wife 1

400
00:23:02,486 --> 00:23:04,806
with some of the old Barnyard charm,
huh?

401
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:09,006
I have to go and see judgie
in chambers.

402
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:12,006
Why?
Social catch-up.

403
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:15,806
What the fuck is this I hear about
you intending to plead not guilty?

404
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:19,166
Bigamy is an offence of
strict liability, Cleave.

405
00:23:19,326 --> 00:23:22,446
There's no defence to it
unless a spouse shoots through.

406
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:24,286
Is that the case here?
Not that I'm aware.

407
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:25,766
So?

408
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:28,846
My hands are tied, Jim.
My client wants his day in court.

409
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:31,246
No, he wants another week
in the press.

410
00:23:31,406 --> 00:23:33,326
He knows public sympathy
is building.

411
00:23:33,486 --> 00:23:36,406
Don't let him do it, Jim.
He has no grounds.

412
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:39,166
I do. Crimes Act, section 52.

413
00:23:39,326 --> 00:23:43,326
“Whosoever steals rocks, stones,
soil, sand or clay

414
00:23:43,486 --> 00:23:45,126
“from private or government land

415
00:23:45,286 --> 00:23:46,606
“is liable to six months in prison.”

416
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:50,126
Under this statute, my son should be
doing hard labour

417
00:23:50,286 --> 00:23:52,326
for nicking a cup of igneous rocks
up at Noosa.

418
00:23:52,486 --> 00:23:54,686
Oh, you've been putting it
up your nose again, haven't you?

419
00:23:54,846 --> 00:23:59,446
The laws pertaining to bigamy are
just as absurd and just as outdated.

420
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,006
I hate to have to break this to you,
Cleaver,

421
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,926
and I know it doesn't accord with
your world view,

422
00:24:05,086 --> 00:24:08,366
but the fact that you don't like
a law isn't a defence.

423
00:24:08,526 --> 00:24:12,206
De facto relationships
now carry equal weight under law.

424
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:13,806
So do gay relationships.

425
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:15,126
So what does this mean?

426
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:17,886
That a gay guy with
a couple of long-term partners

427
00:24:18,046 --> 00:24:21,846
or a businessman who installs his
mistress in a flat up the Cross

428
00:24:22,006 --> 00:24:23,566
should be similarly be charged
with bigamy?

429
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:25,046
We could fill the jails overnight.

430
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:27,326
That's a separate issue.
Jim, don't let...

431
00:24:27,486 --> 00:24:29,046
That... It...
Meg, it's the same issue.

432
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:31,646
Didn't you hear our esteemed
Attorney-General on the radio last night?

433
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:35,966
He was forced to admit that there are
probably hundreds of polygamists

434
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:37,446
in this State right now.

435
00:24:37,606 --> 00:24:39,046
They're not being prosecuted. Why?

436
00:24:39,206 --> 00:24:41,686
Because the vast majority of them
are Muslim.

437
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:44,886
And so the wives don't
or can't complain

438
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:46,886
and the powers that be
turn a blind eye.

439
00:24:47,046 --> 00:24:48,446
Well, that's a cultural issue.

440
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:51,006
Oh, so culture's now a defence,
is it, Jim? Great!

441
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,566
Well, if my client turns out
to be a Mormon, then...

442
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,606
Oh, don't go there, Jim.
It's bullshit.

443
00:24:55,766 --> 00:24:57,726
Jim, Jim, Jim.

444
00:24:57,886 --> 00:25:00,046
Bigamy turns out to be a crime

445
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:03,286
only when one of the wives
cracks the shits.

446
00:25:03,446 --> 00:25:06,406
OK? It's petty vengeance at best.

447
00:25:06,566 --> 00:25:10,406
I'm telling you, for once in your
miserable life, show some ticker.

448
00:25:11,966 --> 00:25:14,326
Your argument has some merit, Cleave.

449
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:17,486
Oh, you are a weak, weak man, Jim!

450
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:21,606
18 years I spent
married to that cow!

451
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:26,726
Now, try not to make a mockery
of my ruling when this hits court

452
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:28,406
or I'll crucify you.

453
00:25:29,406 --> 00:25:31,046
Jim...

454
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:48,006
Sonia Dana?

455
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:52,046
My name's Barney Meagher.
I'm a lawyer assisting your husband.

456
00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:58,286
I clearly did not love him
the way he needed to be loved.

457
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:02,686
I failed him. I drove him
into the arms of another woman.

458
00:26:02,846 --> 00:26:07,166
I'm sure you didn't.
You've got every right to feel angry.

459
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:10,526
Look, if your husband goes to prison,

460
00:26:10,686 --> 00:26:12,526
it's...it's your children
who will suffer.

461
00:26:12,686 --> 00:26:14,286
I am aware of that.

462
00:26:14,446 --> 00:26:18,286
I'm... will help him
in whatever way I can.

463
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:21,406
That's very good of you.

464
00:26:23,366 --> 00:26:27,646
I've always known in my heart
I wasn't meeting his needs.

465
00:26:27,806 --> 00:26:30,526
Hmm. You sense it, don't you?

466
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:35,526
That gnawing sensation
way down inside.

467
00:26:36,726 --> 00:26:38,886
You hope you're wrong, but...

468
00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:41,486
..you know you're not.

469
00:26:41,646 --> 00:26:46,926
Never know when they're going to
hurt us or how to stop it.

470
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:49,126
When you love, you're a prisoner.

471
00:26:49,286 --> 00:26:52,846
When you love and you're
not loved back, it's hell.

472
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:57,926
I tried so hard
to make George happy.

473
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:03,206
I supported her when she
dropped out of law for a year.

474
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:06,086
Paid for her art classes.

475
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:08,446
I paid for his first restaurant.

476
00:27:08,606 --> 00:27:14,206
Yeah, you could buy them India.
Wouldn't mean a damn thing.

477
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,046
Nothing.

478
00:27:21,126 --> 00:27:22,846
So are you the same
with both wives?

479
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:24,326
I suppose not.

480
00:27:24,486 --> 00:27:25,926
Sonia likes me to be the dominant one

481
00:27:26,086 --> 00:27:28,046
and Monique prefers me
quiet and supportive.

482
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:29,926
Which is most you?

483
00:27:30,086 --> 00:27:31,806
Different women
bring out different things.

484
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:35,486
Remember, in the end,
you are what women want, no?

485
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:38,126
How'd you make out with
the Tyrolean Village?

486
00:27:38,286 --> 00:27:42,006
She's on side.
She's a lovely, warm woman.

487
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:45,766
Very vulnerable.
Yeah, yeah, but on side?

488
00:27:45,926 --> 00:27:47,246
Yeah.

489
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:52,366
Your Honour, Mr Dana knowingly
and with full appreciation

490
00:27:52,526 --> 00:27:54,126
of the penalties involved,

491
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:57,926
contravened section 92
of the Crimes Act

492
00:27:58,086 --> 00:28:02,086
by choosing to marry two women
and raise two separate families

493
00:28:02,246 --> 00:28:03,566
at the same time.

494
00:28:03,726 --> 00:28:08,166
He hid this arrangement
from both women

495
00:28:08,326 --> 00:28:10,966
and fully intended to maintain
this lifestyle

496
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:13,726
until one of his wives
discovered the truth.

497
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:19,046
The defendant has committed
a devastating and fundamental

498
00:28:19,206 --> 00:28:20,406
breach of trust

499
00:28:20,566 --> 00:28:24,326
that has destroyed the lives
of two families.

500
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:29,646
One shudders to think of the impact
such deceit will have

501
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:32,406
upon the lives of
six innocent children.

502
00:28:36,206 --> 00:28:38,566
Mr Greene.

503
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:46,366
Ladies and gentlemen, our Crimes Act
is littered with offences

504
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:48,486
that are meaningless today.

505
00:28:48,646 --> 00:28:53,446
It is an act that was promulgated
in 1900.

506
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:57,166
Now, admittedly, there have been
many amendments since.

507
00:28:57,326 --> 00:29:00,966
But still, in many sections,

508
00:29:01,126 --> 00:29:03,566
it reflects the fundamental
hypocrisies

509
00:29:03,726 --> 00:29:07,406
that were inherent in
Victorian Britain.

510
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:10,526
Things have changed,
ladies and gentlemen.

511
00:29:10,686 --> 00:29:15,566
And in an age where morality is
a peculiarly individual matter,

512
00:29:15,726 --> 00:29:20,686
Mr Dana has committed no real crime.

513
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:23,726
Mrs Dana...the Second,

514
00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:29,806
did you marry George Dana
on August 30, 20047

515
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:31,726
I did.

516
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:37,486
Were you aware that George was
already married at the time?

517
00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:39,006
Of course not.

518
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,446
No further questions.

519
00:29:45,486 --> 00:29:50,926
Uh, my client has treated you
very shabbily, hasn't he?

520
00:29:53,486 --> 00:29:57,926
We stood at the altar before God
and my parents.

521
00:29:58,086 --> 00:30:01,766
And George promised that
he would be true to me forever.

522
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:03,406
And then what?

523
00:30:05,086 --> 00:30:07,686
A friend sang
‘Wing Beneath My Wings'.

524
00:30:07,846 --> 00:30:10,686
I meant more AFTER that.

525
00:30:10,846 --> 00:30:13,606
Uh, he was violent, wasn't he?

526
00:30:13,766 --> 00:30:17,086
No. Never.

527
00:30:17,246 --> 00:30:19,726
He's a very gentle man.

528
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:21,926
Really? But mentally cruel?

529
00:30:23,126 --> 00:30:25,126
He was my fairytale prince.

530
00:30:26,446 --> 00:30:29,646
And now he's destroyed everything
that we've worked to build.

531
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:31,526
Which was what, again?

532
00:30:32,886 --> 00:30:37,606
A wonderful life together,
children, our home.

533
00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:41,206
Sorry, which one of these has George
failed to deliver on, Mrs Dana?

534
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:46,006
I mean, you have the house,
three lovely children.

535
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:48,406
If you so choose, you can still have
a life together.

536
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:51,646
He has another entire family.

537
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:56,046
So to understand,
if you had remained ignorant

538
00:30:56,206 --> 00:30:59,006
of the existence of the other wife
and children,

539
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,566
you would still be deliriously happy?

540
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:04,806
He's deceived me.

541
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:09,766
Isn't it entirely possible
that when he was with you,

542
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:12,926
he was being completely sincere?

543
00:31:13,086 --> 00:31:16,766
And when he was with
the other Mrs Dana,

544
00:31:16,926 --> 00:31:19,006
he was also sincere?

545
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:23,766
You can only be sincere
with one person.

546
00:31:23,926 --> 00:31:25,646
Oh.

547
00:31:25,806 --> 00:31:28,166
That's a Catholic thing, isn't it?

548
00:31:28,326 --> 00:31:30,166
Your Honour!
I withdraw it.

549
00:31:30,326 --> 00:31:32,086
No further questions.
Thank you, Your Honour.

550
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,926
With Your Honour's indulgence...

551
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:38,566
You want more?

552
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:42,326
I have written down on these cards

553
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:45,646
questions lifted directly from

554
00:31:45,806 --> 00:31:50,086
Scott Knowles's
‘Guide to Being a Great Dad'.

555
00:31:50,246 --> 00:31:52,886
Um...

556
00:31:56,886 --> 00:32:01,646
Mr Dana, what is your second child's
favourite toy?

557
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:03,406
From my first marriage?

558
00:32:03,566 --> 00:32:05,206
Let's start there.

559
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:08,086
Michaela.

560
00:32:09,486 --> 00:32:12,166
A little donkey she calls Mr Jasper.

561
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,326
And from the second?
Roman.

562
00:32:16,486 --> 00:32:20,566
His favourite toy is Peter Patch —
the elephant.

563
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:24,446
Right.

564
00:32:24,606 --> 00:32:27,766
Tell me about the favourite sport

565
00:32:27,926 --> 00:32:30,886
of your youngest son
from your first marriage.

566
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:34,886
Eric. Eric is soccer mad.

567
00:32:35,046 --> 00:32:37,926
Every Saturday,
I have to take him to the game.

568
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:39,406
Then I go to the Blue Mountains

569
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:41,366
to take my eldest daughter
to her basketball

570
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,206
and then I have to hurry back
to Surry Hills

571
00:32:43,366 --> 00:32:45,486
to take my little one
to her evening ballet class.

572
00:32:45,646 --> 00:32:47,206
Your Honour!

573
00:32:49,086 --> 00:32:52,606
He's a model father
in all but one minor respect.

574
00:32:52,766 --> 00:32:55,326
He loves his children,
he loves his wives.

575
00:32:55,486 --> 00:32:57,886
He was doing it all
for his own gratification.

576
00:32:58,046 --> 00:33:01,086
How can circumnavigating the bloody
continent three times a week

577
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,726
in supporting six children,
two houses and two wives

578
00:33:03,886 --> 00:33:05,406
be for your own gratification?

579
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,366
He was just trying to escape
the inevitable boredom

580
00:33:08,526 --> 00:33:10,326
that comes with
a long-term marriage.

581
00:33:10,486 --> 00:33:11,846
We certainly know about that.

582
00:33:12,006 --> 00:33:13,846
You've just summarised
the position of the law, Meg.

583
00:33:14,006 --> 00:33:16,766
Due to some hairshirt,
Calvinist tradition

584
00:33:16,926 --> 00:33:18,726
or premature bottle-feeding,

585
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:24,446
you believe that all people should
suffer through marriage until death.

586
00:33:24,606 --> 00:33:29,006
No reprieve, just jail for anyone who
gives in to the inevitable boredom.

587
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:32,006
There is a small get-out-of-jail clause
called divorce.

588
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:34,166
Thank...
He didn't want to divorce them.

589
00:33:34,326 --> 00:33:35,886
He loves them.

590
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:38,206
Let's adjourn for the day.

591
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:40,126
I might have more energy
for this tomorrow.

592
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:41,886
I doubt it.

593
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:00,846
There is someone else.

594
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:05,926
Keep your shirt on, Barn...

595
00:34:07,606 --> 00:34:08,926
She admitted it.

596
00:34:09,086 --> 00:34:11,686
Shit. OK.

597
00:34:11,846 --> 00:34:13,326
Did she say who?

598
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,086
No.

599
00:34:17,246 --> 00:34:18,686
Good.

600
00:34:18,846 --> 00:34:23,686
I mean, good that you've opened up
a line of communication, huh?

601
00:34:24,886 --> 00:34:28,006
She said she loves someone else
and she needs to find herself.

602
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:32,486
Why in times of crisis do women speak
fluent cliché?

603
00:34:32,646 --> 00:34:34,286
You OK?

604
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:35,886
I locked myself in the study.

605
00:34:36,046 --> 00:34:38,046
Put on some Diamond.

606
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:41,046
Tried to take stock of my life.

607
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:44,046
Are you sure she's not leaving you
because of your musical taste?

608
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:46,646
You don't even know how to
get depressed properly.

609
00:34:46,806 --> 00:34:48,686
Can we go out for a drink?

610
00:34:48,846 --> 00:34:50,526
Please.

611
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:56,926
There's a hint of passionfruit
in this.

612
00:34:57,086 --> 00:34:58,086
Bit too sweet.

613
00:34:58,246 --> 00:35:00,886
Oh, fuck, mate. It's not
a bloody wine-tasting.

614
00:35:01,046 --> 00:35:02,686
We're supposed to be
getting shit-faced here

615
00:35:02,846 --> 00:35:05,406
and weeping about
the futility of existence.

616
00:35:05,566 --> 00:35:07,486
I'm the only one holding my end up.

617
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:09,126
I'm used to being positive.

618
00:35:09,286 --> 00:35:11,806
Well, try not to be, OK?

619
00:35:11,966 --> 00:35:14,846
You brought me to this
bloody lawyers' bar

620
00:35:15,006 --> 00:35:18,606
full of men with
irritable bowel syndrome.

621
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:20,486
Let's go...let's go...
let's go somewhere

622
00:35:20,646 --> 00:35:23,126
where I feel a bit more like
a gynaecologist, yeah?

623
00:35:23,286 --> 00:35:24,606
Scarlet hates the routine.

624
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:27,726
She hates how ordinary
our life has become.

625
00:35:27,886 --> 00:35:32,366
I love our little walks around
Bronte, our lunches at the pub.

626
00:35:32,526 --> 00:35:35,246
Why does everyone want a big life?

627
00:35:35,406 --> 00:35:37,446
Oh, no!

628
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:41,166
I told you it was a lawyers' bar.

629
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:47,566
She even admitted he was hopeless.
An indulgent, tragic, middle-aged failure.

630
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:49,926
Right, well, there you go.

631
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:53,206
I suppose it could just be the sex.

632
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:55,726
She said he wasn't even
all that good in bed.

633
00:35:56,726 --> 00:35:58,246
I just don't get it.

634
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,966
Ah, Cleaver.
Ah!

635
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:03,366
Barney, you remember Melissa.
Yep.

636
00:36:03,526 --> 00:36:05,726
Barney. Hi, Cleaver.
Hello, Melissa.

637
00:36:05,886 --> 00:36:09,366
Don't you just love this place, huh?
Our kind of crowd.

638
00:36:09,526 --> 00:36:12,566
We have a booking.
Table for six. Potter.

639
00:36:12,726 --> 00:36:14,846
Is Scarlet here?
If you two'd like to join us...

640
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,726
She's having an affair.

641
00:36:16,886 --> 00:36:19,286
Right. I'm sorry.

642
00:36:19,446 --> 00:36:22,406
Don't think I meant
to say that out loud.

643
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:24,086
Hope it all works out.

644
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:27,366
How are you, Cleaver?
I'm tickety-boo.

645
00:36:27,526 --> 00:36:30,326
Good to see you, mate. Call you.
Thanks, mate.

646
00:36:32,086 --> 00:36:34,206
Can we get a double vodka martini

647
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:37,326
and a passionfruit whip
for my father here.

648
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:40,166
Can we put it on their table, please?
We're with them.

649
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:43,646
So here I was, six —
I was on one train going to Orvieto

650
00:36:43,806 --> 00:36:45,206
holding the wrong man's hand,

651
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:49,846
whilst my parents were on the train
to Florence with the wrong daughter.

652
00:36:50,886 --> 00:36:53,566
Good Lord! It's Clark Kent!

653
00:36:53,726 --> 00:36:55,526
No, it's Superman.

654
00:36:55,686 --> 00:36:56,526
G'day, Norton.

655
00:36:56,686 --> 00:36:58,006
How is my wounded hero?

656
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,126
It's just a kryptonite flesh wound.

657
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:01,326
Oh!

658
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,326
I believe you know everyone here
except for Melissa.

659
00:37:03,486 --> 00:37:06,966
My, uh...well, the love of my life.

660
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:08,486
Hello, Melissa.

661
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:10,606
David has certainly kept you
a secret.

662
00:37:10,766 --> 00:37:12,886
So how's that ATX thing going?

663
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:16,446
Ooh, it's a bloody goldmine. I swear,
there's another house and pool in it.

664
00:37:16,606 --> 00:37:19,486
It'll run for another 18 months at least.
Excuse me.

665
00:37:19,646 --> 00:37:21,246
What are you drinking, sweetheart?

666
00:37:29,526 --> 00:37:31,046
Fuck off, Norton.

667
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,886
Please. Someone's gonna come in.

668
00:37:35,806 --> 00:37:37,806
You know I'm heartbroken.

669
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:40,006
You left the club without a boo

670
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:42,326
and I had to find another girlie
to tag team.

671
00:37:42,486 --> 00:37:45,046
I'm out of it for good.
Oooh.

672
00:37:45,206 --> 00:37:47,526
Please, I beg you.
Don't say a word to David.

673
00:37:47,686 --> 00:37:50,446
So the whole time
you were dining out

674
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:53,206
on the supreme justice here,

675
00:37:53,366 --> 00:37:56,166
you were thinking of studying law.

676
00:37:56,326 --> 00:37:59,926
Well, I had to do something
to keep me awake.

677
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:03,846
No, no, no, no, no.

678
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:09,126
Mmm. Let's grab a cubicle. Come on.

679
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:11,326
I'll give you 10 bucks.
You give me some oral.

680
00:38:11,486 --> 00:38:13,166
Mates rates.

681
00:38:13,326 --> 00:38:14,886
Because I am
a mate of David's

682
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:17,526
and we don't want to
stuff his evening.

683
00:38:33,206 --> 00:38:35,686
If you're here for marriage advice,
don't do it.

684
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:39,086
It's an invention by 12th-century
legislators to deal with progeniture.

685
00:38:39,246 --> 00:38:42,126
I'm in trouble.
It's a long queue.

686
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,606
I don't have anyone else.

687
00:38:43,766 --> 00:38:45,366
What happened to Harry...
sorry, Hero Potter?

688
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:47,246
I can't tell him. He can't know.

689
00:38:47,406 --> 00:38:48,726
I'm sorry. How does this work?

690
00:38:48,886 --> 00:38:52,006
You piss me off. You tell me you don't
want me in your life anymore...

691
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:53,846
I had this school friend,

692
00:38:54,006 --> 00:38:57,646
and she met Robert at a party
when she was 23

693
00:38:57,806 --> 00:39:00,286
and they talked together all night.

694
00:39:00,446 --> 00:39:04,766
And then as the sun came up,
he proposed to her on the spot

695
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,246
and she said yes.

696
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:07,726
I've been there. Spiked punch.

697
00:39:07,886 --> 00:39:12,406
And now they have three kids
and they're always laughing and...

698
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:14,126
Oh, fuck it, Cleave.

699
00:39:14,286 --> 00:39:16,926
They just love each other.

700
00:39:17,086 --> 00:39:20,006
I mean, is it so wrong
for me to just want that?

701
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:28,646
And that's what you have with
David...sorry, Harry?

702
00:39:28,806 --> 00:39:31,406
Will you please help me?

703
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:36,766
Sonia Dana, despite
all that's happened,

704
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:39,366
do you continue to love your husband?

705
00:39:39,526 --> 00:39:42,406
Yes, I do. Very much.

706
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:45,326
Would you say he's been a good father
to your children?

707
00:39:45,486 --> 00:39:46,926
He's a fine father.

708
00:39:47,086 --> 00:39:49,646
They love him, he loves them.

709
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:52,526
And he's always provided adequately?

710
00:39:52,686 --> 00:39:56,486
He's a generous man — always.
We're very comfortable.

711
00:39:56,646 --> 00:40:00,246
And so when it comes time for
the judge to hand down his sentence,

712
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:03,366
what would you like
that outcome to be?

713
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,406
Seven years in prison.

714
00:40:05,566 --> 00:40:07,286
So even though...

715
00:40:08,526 --> 00:40:10,686
I beg your pardon?
Yes.

716
00:40:12,046 --> 00:40:15,806
I thought long and hard about
what you said, and you were right.

717
00:40:15,966 --> 00:40:18,806
I was blaming myself for
not fulfilling his desires.

718
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:20,286
So...
That will be all.

719
00:40:20,446 --> 00:40:21,486
Thank you, Your Honour.

720
00:40:21,646 --> 00:40:24,406
Your Honour, Mrs Dana the First
is a defence witness.

721
00:40:24,566 --> 00:40:29,046
Surely my learned friend would like
to hear her complete testimony?

722
00:40:31,206 --> 00:40:34,486
Yes. Proceed, Mrs Dana.

723
00:40:39,966 --> 00:40:42,286
We can only give what we have.

724
00:40:44,086 --> 00:40:45,566
And I gave that.

725
00:40:46,806 --> 00:40:49,326
And you abused it.

726
00:40:49,486 --> 00:40:51,246
You're too greedy, George.

727
00:40:52,246 --> 00:40:53,806
You expect too much.

728
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:55,606
Thank you.

729
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,766
Ms Makepeace?

730
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:04,446
No questions, Your Honour.
Mr Greene has done superbly.

731
00:41:08,086 --> 00:41:12,846
George Dana is in most respects
a model husband.

732
00:41:13,006 --> 00:41:14,726
Only twice.

733
00:41:14,886 --> 00:41:20,566
The reality is if Mr Dana
had married his first wife

734
00:41:20,726 --> 00:41:26,926
and just decided to have a squalid,
shabby affair with Monique,

735
00:41:27,086 --> 00:41:29,606
he would not be before us today.

736
00:41:30,606 --> 00:41:35,286
Indeed, he could've still had kids
with his second great love,

737
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:37,046
he could've bought a house with her —

738
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:38,926
the law would take no umbrage.

739
00:41:39,086 --> 00:41:44,206
But because Mr Dana chose to do
the honourable thing,

740
00:41:44,366 --> 00:41:49,166
the thing that both women wanted,
which was to marry them,

741
00:41:49,326 --> 00:41:52,246
Ms Makepeace now wants to
incarcerate him.

742
00:41:52,406 --> 00:41:55,166
We have shown Mr Dana to be...
Uh, Your Honour.

743
00:41:55,326 --> 00:41:57,886
Sorry to interrupt
the Sermon on the Mount.

744
00:41:58,046 --> 00:42:00,046
Some information
has just come to hand

745
00:42:00,206 --> 00:42:02,326
that has great relevance
to this matter.

746
00:42:03,326 --> 00:42:04,566
Three wives?!

747
00:42:04,726 --> 00:42:08,406
Didn't you think when you were
charged, this fact might emerge?

748
00:42:09,766 --> 00:42:11,246
I was hoping it wouldn't.

749
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,486
I don't know if there's a law
for trigomy.

750
00:42:13,646 --> 00:42:15,046
Bugger me!

751
00:42:15,206 --> 00:42:18,646
I had the judge right here.
Right here!

752
00:42:18,806 --> 00:42:21,566
Who is she?
I met her in Newcastle.

753
00:42:21,726 --> 00:42:23,246
Oh! The new restaurant, yeah?

754
00:42:23,406 --> 00:42:26,366
Her name is Juno.
She's like a juniper berry.

755
00:42:26,526 --> 00:42:29,086
She's got a sharp flavour,
but with sweetness also.

756
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:32,206
I don't care if she carries
a seed pod on her back.

757
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:34,166
Stop marrying people!

758
00:42:34,326 --> 00:42:36,366
I love these women.

759
00:42:36,526 --> 00:42:39,246
Yeah, well, now you're gonna have to
learn to love men in showers.

760
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:41,286
I have no idea how to save you.

761
00:42:47,126 --> 00:42:49,366
How did Security
ever let you in?

762
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:51,166
Need a minute of your time, mate.

763
00:42:51,326 --> 00:42:53,206
You can't afford it,
sunshine.

764
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:56,486
If you want to make an appointment,
speak to my girl.

765
00:43:00,086 --> 00:43:01,886
I don't do appointments.

766
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,206
Alright, Cleaver, what's this about?

767
00:43:04,366 --> 00:43:06,366
Our mutual friend Melissa.

768
00:43:06,526 --> 00:43:08,286
Who? Oh, the slut.

769
00:43:08,446 --> 00:43:11,446
You don't know her,
you've never met her,

770
00:43:11,606 --> 00:43:14,326
you know nothing about her past, OK?

771
00:43:14,486 --> 00:43:15,966
Let her get on with her life.

772
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:18,486
She's earnt that.
It's no skin off your nose.

773
00:43:20,446 --> 00:43:23,486
Don't tell me we have feelings
for the slut too?

774
00:43:23,646 --> 00:43:25,886
My God. First David, now you.

775
00:43:26,046 --> 00:43:30,166
I promise you I will drag you down
to my level,

776
00:43:30,326 --> 00:43:32,286
and not even I want to live there.

777
00:43:33,526 --> 00:43:38,566
Cleaver, I eat miserable,
sad failures like you on an hourly basis.

778
00:43:38,726 --> 00:43:42,366
I will do with Miss Missy
whatever I fucking well feel like!

779
00:43:43,966 --> 00:43:45,846
Are we clear on that front?

780
00:43:59,726 --> 00:44:03,086
These damn lift doors.
Been warning him about this.

781
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,926
I'm unchaining you.

782
00:44:31,086 --> 00:44:33,606
You can have your precious freedom.

783
00:44:35,646 --> 00:44:39,126
I think we should...
No, no, go.

784
00:44:39,286 --> 00:44:41,606
Soar like an eagle.

785
00:44:52,366 --> 00:44:55,246
I still have feelings for you.

786
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:57,486
I doubt you ever have.

787
00:44:57,646 --> 00:45:00,166
Oh, no, that's not fair.
That is so not fair.

788
00:45:00,326 --> 00:45:01,646
I've always stood by you.

789
00:45:01,806 --> 00:45:04,006
And I've never given you
a bloody reason not to.

790
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:06,486
OK, you're angry.

791
00:45:06,646 --> 00:45:09,846
You're hurting
and you're lashing out. I get that.

792
00:45:10,006 --> 00:45:12,526
But we need to try to protect
what we have here.

793
00:45:12,686 --> 00:45:14,126
I've been going through
your artwork.

794
00:45:14,286 --> 00:45:17,846
‘Allegorical Woman III.

795
00:45:19,046 --> 00:45:23,206
It's only allegorical because you
couldn't make it look like a woman.

796
00:45:24,606 --> 00:45:26,526
Honey, you're just
demeaning yourself now.

797
00:45:26,686 --> 00:45:30,046
You'll regret this in the morning.
No.

798
00:45:30,206 --> 00:45:33,126
I regret not saying it earlier.

799
00:45:33,286 --> 00:45:35,326
Your art is crap.

800
00:45:35,486 --> 00:45:38,366
You have no discernible talent.

801
00:45:38,526 --> 00:45:42,686
The idea you can give up the law
to paint...

802
00:45:44,046 --> 00:45:45,686
..it's laughable.

803
00:45:50,046 --> 00:45:51,886
Oh, hell!

804
00:45:52,046 --> 00:45:56,366
Just put my foot through
Allegorical Woman's breast.

805
00:45:56,526 --> 00:45:58,446
Or is that a foot?

806
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,046
Let's not delude
ourselves here.

807
00:46:05,206 --> 00:46:09,846
George Dana has no regard
for his many wives, children

808
00:46:10,006 --> 00:46:15,166
or for the moral laws
that underpin our society.

809
00:46:15,326 --> 00:46:18,686
There are no
mitigating circumstances.

810
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:21,966
Mr Greene passes this crime off

811
00:46:22,126 --> 00:46:25,206
as a piece of trivia, an anachronism,

812
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:27,966
a statute from the Palaeozoic era.

813
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:31,926
Why? Because it doesn't suit him.

814
00:46:32,086 --> 00:46:37,566
If we were all allowed to break laws
that we disagree with,

815
00:46:37,726 --> 00:46:40,726
society would be in chaos.

816
00:46:40,886 --> 00:46:44,966
We could not enter into an agreement
or transaction of any kind

817
00:46:45,126 --> 00:46:46,566
with any certainty.

818
00:46:46,726 --> 00:46:52,086
Promises made under oath matter.

819
00:46:52,246 --> 00:46:56,206
It is not enough to say,
“I don't like the law.”

820
00:46:57,846 --> 00:47:03,766
Mr Dana has proven himself to be
a liar and a criminal.

821
00:47:13,126 --> 00:47:14,446
Mr Greene.

822
00:47:14,606 --> 00:47:17,206
Oh! Oh.

823
00:47:17,366 --> 00:47:19,646
Thank you, Your Honour.

824
00:47:19,806 --> 00:47:21,286
Uh...

825
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:26,686
If I wasn't dozing off,
I think I may have heard

826
00:47:26,846 --> 00:47:30,886
Ms Makepeace suggest that marriage
is an institution

827
00:47:31,046 --> 00:47:34,046
that underpins our society.

828
00:47:34,206 --> 00:47:37,126
But she's wrong.

829
00:47:37,286 --> 00:47:40,686
One in two marriages
now end in grief.

830
00:47:40,846 --> 00:47:42,326
Here.

831
00:47:44,526 --> 00:47:47,886
Five women's magazines
picked at random.

832
00:47:48,046 --> 00:47:53,246
“Brad — the affair I had to have.”

833
00:47:54,286 --> 00:47:57,886
“Halle — I want him back.”

834
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:03,566
Marriage is now a sport.
It's not an institution.

835
00:48:03,726 --> 00:48:05,246
May 1?

836
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:11,326
The truth is George Dana,
ladies and gentlemen,

837
00:48:11,486 --> 00:48:13,126
is a man from a bygone era.

838
00:48:13,286 --> 00:48:17,366
He's a man who still
holds steadfastly

839
00:48:17,526 --> 00:48:22,166
to the idea of honour and commitment

840
00:48:22,326 --> 00:48:24,206
to those he loves.

841
00:48:24,366 --> 00:48:28,166
He didn't set out to break up
the institution of marriage

842
00:48:28,326 --> 00:48:30,566
or to hurt these women.

843
00:48:30,726 --> 00:48:33,246
He stills believes in it.

844
00:48:33,406 --> 00:48:36,806
He may be its last true champion.

845
00:48:37,886 --> 00:48:42,446
His sole purpose was to make
these women happy.

846
00:48:43,486 --> 00:48:45,006
And it still is.

847
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:51,886
Jail terms for rapists,
murderers, paedophiles,

848
00:48:52,046 --> 00:48:54,006
but not for George Dana,

849
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:57,846
a man who simply loved too much.

850
00:49:10,246 --> 00:49:12,286
We find the defendant...

851
00:49:13,366 --> 00:49:14,886
..guilty.

852
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:20,406
I agree with the prosecution
when they argue

853
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:22,486
that Mr Dana was aware of the law

854
00:49:22,646 --> 00:49:25,606
and knowingly deceived
three decent women.

855
00:49:25,766 --> 00:49:27,726
Finally some spine.

856
00:49:27,886 --> 00:49:30,406
..also find merit
in Mr Greene's argument

857
00:49:30,566 --> 00:49:32,126
that the penalties under the law

858
00:49:32,286 --> 00:49:34,926
greatly outweigh the impact
of the crime.

859
00:49:35,086 --> 00:49:38,886
I believe Mr Dana
did love his wives,

860
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:42,126
that he did knowingly break the law.

861
00:49:42,286 --> 00:49:46,166
Worse, he lied to this court

862
00:49:46,326 --> 00:49:49,486
by not declaring a third wife.

863
00:49:49,646 --> 00:49:54,126
And thus he proves himself again
a person of unreliable character.

864
00:49:56,206 --> 00:49:59,006
I'm giving Mr Dana
a three-year sentence.

865
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:00,006
Yes!

866
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:04,726
But I'm going to suspend all but
three months of that sentence...

867
00:50:04,886 --> 00:50:06,886
Weak, weak man.

868
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:11,526
And he must immediately divorce
at least two of his wives.

869
00:50:13,526 --> 00:50:16,486
Try not to marry anyone
while you're inside, will you?

870
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:30,966
My God, you were so pretty.

871
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:32,726
You look like your mum.

872
00:50:32,886 --> 00:50:35,926
You can tell she was Spanish, though.

873
00:50:36,086 --> 00:50:39,966
You have changed a bit
around the cheeks and the chin.

874
00:50:40,126 --> 00:50:43,566
It was taken near Cozumel
in Mexico.

875
00:50:43,726 --> 00:50:45,206
Mum and Dad were a bit merry.

876
00:50:45,366 --> 00:50:48,686
We'd all been laughing and swimming

877
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:51,886
and collecting seashells together.

878
00:50:52,046 --> 00:50:57,126
Well, they're here now
and welcome in our home.

879
00:51:15,646 --> 00:51:18,126
Even after a hundred hours...

880
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:22,206
..you name it, there is almost no surface
the G-Force drill bit can't penetrate.

881
00:51:22,366 --> 00:51:24,686
Forget wasting hours sharpening
dull and rusty drill bits

882
00:51:24,846 --> 00:51:26,286
when one set of pristine
G-Force bits...

883
00:51:26,446 --> 00:51:27,286
Hey.

884
00:51:27,446 --> 00:51:28,806
You're still up.

885
00:51:28,966 --> 00:51:33,326
Do you know they got this drill bit
that never needs sharpening?

886
00:51:33,486 --> 00:51:36,926
Even after a hundred hours
into metal?

887
00:51:38,086 --> 00:51:41,926
Listen, I don't know what you did
or said, but thank you.

888
00:51:42,086 --> 00:51:45,326
Oh, I just had a friendly chat.

889
00:51:45,486 --> 00:51:49,366
And I think, um...
I think Norton felt really bad.

890
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:55,686
David is a good, good
warm-hearted man who loves me.

891
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:58,046
All this and a tax lawyer!

892
00:51:58,206 --> 00:52:00,846
And I know I can be happy with him.

893
00:52:02,406 --> 00:52:06,526
But I don't know why,
when things turned to shit,

894
00:52:06,686 --> 00:52:09,326
I came to you and not him.

895
00:52:09,486 --> 00:52:11,086
..once-in-a-lifetime opportunity...

896
00:52:11,246 --> 00:52:13,206
Think I'm gonna buy this drill.

897
00:52:13,366 --> 00:52:14,806
..three sets of G-Force drill bits...

898
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:15,886
Goodnight.

899
