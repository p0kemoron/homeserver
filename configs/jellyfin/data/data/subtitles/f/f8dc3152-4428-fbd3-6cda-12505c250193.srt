1
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,471
[panting]

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,018
[Jaden] Dad!

3
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,270
- [Rusty] Get out of my fucking house.
- [Barbara] Rusty, stop!

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,688
Get out!

5
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,065
- Get inside!
- [Jaden] Okay, okay!

6
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,900
- Babe, babe, babe. Look at me.
- [crying]

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,028
[Raymond]
<i>Rusty? What the hell is going on?</i>

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,364
- [Barbara] Honey, baby, look, he's gone.
- [Raymond] <i>Rusty, talk to me.</i>

9
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,323
- [Barbara] Breathe, breathe, breathe.
- [Raymond] <i>Rusty?</i>

10
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,367
[breathing heavily]

11
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,793
[Barbara]
So you thought he had information,

12
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:45,170
and you went to his house.

13
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,132
Then he comes h-here for-- For what?

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,301
To intimidate you?

15
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,596
Rusty, you could have killed him.

16
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,311
What if he goes to the police?

17
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,396
[Rusty] He won't.

18
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,397
How do you know?

19
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,442
He won't.

20
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,031
[breathes shakily]

21
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,868
[punching keys]

22
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,426
[punching keys]

23
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,239
[knocks on door]

24
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,407
- Tommy?
- [Tommy] Yeah? Mmm.

25
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:57,951
I'm being told I'm the first witness,
or one of the first.

26
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,161
I would like to know why.

27
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,788
The defense will be arguing
prosecutorial bias,

28
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,749
and you can puncture that
straight out of the gate.

29
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,168
If you expect me to say I think
Rusty committed murder, I'm not doing it.

30
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:09,003
[stammers] No.
I don't expect for you to say anything.

31
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,634
I just expect for you to tell the truth.
You have a problem with that?

32
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,514
What is it with you two?

33
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:21,517
You have some kind of thing with him?

34
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:22,684
[stammers] With Rusty?

35
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,769
- [Tommy] Yeah.
- Mmm.

36
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,021
[Tommy] If there were,
I would need to know about it.

37
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,274
You ever kiss him?

38
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,110
Inappropriate.

39
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,529
Irrelevant.

40
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,197
Go fuck yourself.

41
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,074
You're being called as a witness

42
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:39,159
to attest to the relationship
between Carolyn and Rusty,

43
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,994
and I need to know
you have professional objectivity.

44
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,122
If professional
objectivity is really a concern,

45
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,208
perhaps you should recuse yourself.

46
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,292
Mm-hmm.

47
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,923
You know, there's been a lot
of restructuring going on around here,

48
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:57,928
and I want you to know that Nico and I
value loyalty above all else.

49
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,644
[door opens]

50
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,276

[groans, breathes deeply]

57
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,137
[slurping]

58
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,807
[groans]

59
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,227
- [breathing heavily]
- [heartbeat thumping]

60

- [water running]
- [grunts]

- [breathes heavily]
- [Lorraine] <i>It just exploded?</i>

65
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,591
Yeah. Went everywhere.

66
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,428
All over the office.

67
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,391
[sighs] Raymond, all these nightmares,

68
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,228
they're all telling you the same thing,

69
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:31,522
which is what the evidence...

70
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,898
- Can we not?
- ...is telling you.

71
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:38,904
Is there any evidence, even a scintilla,
that points to somebody else?

72
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:43,325
Lo, it's not a question
of evidence pointing to somebody else.

73
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,409
It's the lack of evidence...

74
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,911
- Pointing to him.
- ...that points to Rusty.

75
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,746
I know. The burden.

76
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,999
Shall we talk about the burden
you'll be bearing?

77
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,251
Can we not?

78
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:54,962
He didn't do it.

79
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,715
Hmm. Doesn't matter.

80
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,511
You argue for the defense now, anyway.

81
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:08,892
[Rusty panting]

82
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,060
[treadmill beeps]

83
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,113
[treadmill beeps]

[grunts]

85
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,842
[hip-hop playing in the distance]

86
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,387
[Brian] Let's go, Laura. Hurry it up.

87
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,101
[engine starts]

88
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,626
[chattering]

89
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:49,993
- [dog barking]
- Fuck!

90
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,957
[barking continues]

91
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,345
[barking continues]

92
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:15,769
- Hey! Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Hey.

93
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,688
[breathes heavily] Hey, I just wanna talk.

94
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:19,398
I'm calling the cops.

95
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,525
You're gonna call
the cops after the other night?

96
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,318
Fine. Oh, why don't I drive you there?

97
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:24,903
We can fill out the report together.

98
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,321
The hell is wrong with you?

99
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,282
I just-- I just wanna talk to you.

100
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:29,575
Okay?

101
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,743
Just-- Just--
Just have a conversation with me.

102
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,204
[breathing heavily]

103
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,331
You assaulted. You trespassed.

104
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,042
- He can claim that you're extorting him.
- I-I assaulted him? I trespassed?

105
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,837
- Hardly believe that he would come--
- Best way for him to get ahead of that,

106
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:45,007
- right, is to go to the police.
- [stammers]

107
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,176
If he can curry favor with the cops

108
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:50,596
by characterizing you
as a fucking sociopathic nutjob,

109
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:53,348
which, from where I stand, Rusty,

110
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,227
it's the direction of the spiral
that you're in, I'm-- [stammers]

111
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,063
Mya.

112
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:01,982
She's a fresh mind.

113
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,066
She's objective.

114
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,194
Listen to this theory of Rusty's.

115
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,030
Liam Reynolds is our best suspect.

116
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,489
He had a motive.

117
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,074
- Getting fucked over!
- [people clamoring]

118
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,243
[Rusty] <i>And despite being in prison,
he had the means.</i>

119
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,912
He knew people on the outside.

120
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:19,917
And according to Rigo, who has been
talking to some of the inmates,

121
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,919
<i>Reynolds has intimated that he killed her.</i>

122
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,879
She was about notches on her belt.

123
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,965
Even if Reynolds were involved...

124
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,092
I would gladly crater her skull.

125
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,471
[groans] What I'm saying--
Carolyn buried the evidence.

126
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:36,433
- [Raymond] Which was inconclusive.
- No, Carolyn buried the evidence, Ray.

127
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,851
[phone ringing]

128
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,395
- [Carolyn] Hey.
- Did you get the results back?

129
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:45,317
Um, nothing unexpected from the prelim.

130
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:49,112
And Ratzer,
his semen was at the homicide scene.

131
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:52,658
So it's not the fucking reach
that you're making it out to be.

132
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,333
Okay. But that's not our case.

133
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:03,460
- [Raymond] She's right.
- [sighs]

134
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:08,131
Hey, there are two things I've learned
in my professional experience.

135
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,051
One is that prison informants,

136
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,429
they will say or fabricate anything
to improve their plight.

137
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,892
Two, those who commit murder,
they tend to threaten, to boast,

138
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,602
to fuck other inmates up the ass.

139
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,773
What they do not tend to do
is walk around intimating.

140
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:26,817
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,027
And even if Reynolds was involved...

142
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:32,072
[sighs] ...I still don't see
how this Ratzer guy helps us now.

143
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,700
What I'm saying is the two of them
could be connected, Raymond.

144
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,910
Maybe they know each other.

145
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,955
This is my fucking life.

146
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,039
Yeah.

147
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,251
I know, and I would like to save it

148
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:48,338
because you came to me
to defend your life, your freedom.

149
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,675
But Rusty, whatever our strategy...

150
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,761
[chuckling] ...it's not going to be,

151
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,599
"Hey, there's this guy who knows
this other guy who's in prison,

152
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,434
both of whom had spermatozoa

153
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:04,021
at the same apartment
of some dead prostitute."

154
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:07,399
Who was tied up exactly like Carolyn was.

155
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,483
Not exactly.

156
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,028
Similarly.

157
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,364
[groans] My God. Fine.
Well, you know what?

158
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,450
You can ask Ratzer yourself.
He's gonna be here tomorrow.

159
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,618
What?

160
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,790
Yeah.

161
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,383
He's on the treadmill.

162
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,470
Oh, yeah. My suggestion.

163
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,056
He attacked a man last night.

164
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,475
Better the treadmill.

165
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:46,563
Mom, did he do this?

166
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,445
No. No, honey.

167
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,281
<i>Your dad has a lot of rage inside him...</i>

168
00:10:58,534 --> 00:10:59,993
but not this.

169
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,749
[Rusty] Ratzer, I think it could be him.

170
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,878
You sure it's not your bias?

171
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,219
Could be that.

172
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:19,304
What does Mr. Horgan think?

173
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,348
Ray thinks it's a dead end,

174
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,976
and he thinks that
I'm becoming a loose cannon.

175
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,435
[Jaden] Is he right?

176
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,520
[Rusty] Maybe.

177
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:30,399
I mean, you do kind of seem like
you've jumped the tracks a little.

178
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,817
What is that supposed to mean?

179
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,819
I mean, you beat a man up.

180
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,864
Jay, he came to our house.

181
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,659
He threatened you. He threatened Mom.

182
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,078
What was I supposed to do?

183
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,665
I don't know.

184
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,418
I'm scared for you.

185
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:50,669
Oh, honey.

186
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:55,883
[sighs]

187
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,635
It's okay.

188
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,849
[sighs]

189
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:09,980
[groans]

190
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,652
- Hey, Tommy.
- Hey, Carolyn.

191
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,238
- You're stalking me?
- [Tommy chuckles] I am stalking--

192
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,286
Okay, listen. It's come to my attention
you don't wanna work with me, and, um--

193
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,247
Who said that?

194
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,833
Oh, God. [chuckles]
Never mind who said it.

195
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,710
Is it true that you
don't wanna work with me?

196
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,796
- [Carolyn] <i>I--</i>
- [Tommy] <i>Just tell me.</i>

197
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,006
- [Carolyn] <i>I said...</i>
- [sighs]

198
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:39,968
...I-I prefer to... [clears throat]
...first chair my own cases.

199
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:43,722
And if I were to second chair,
then I'd rather it be with Rusty,

200
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,892
since he's chief deputy prosecutor,
and career-wise, you know...

201
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,353
- Yeah, I know. It makes s-sense.
- Yeah.

202
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:52,439
It just came back that you
specifically didn't wanna work with me.

203
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:54,900
I didn't say that.

204
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,361
I-- Maybe I was misconstrued.

205
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,238
[knocks on door]

206
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:05,494
- [Nico] Working late.
- [groans] Yeah.

207
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:12,167
Listen, this Liam Reynolds,
the one who killed Bunny Davis?

208
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,628
[Tommy] What about him?

209
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:17,339
[Nico] That's exactly it.
You know, I've been hearing things.

210
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,966
That he made
credible threats against Carolyn.

211
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,425
- [Tommy] He's in prison.
- [Nico] And...

212
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,303
yeah.

213
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:25,889
But you checked him out?

214
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:30,018
We did, and if the investigators turn up
anything new, we'll look into it.

215
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:33,188
But you don't think
there's any there there, do you?

216
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,777
- He's in prison.
- Yeah.

217
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,654
Liam Reynolds is a dead end.

218
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:43,574
Right now,
our focus is Rusty Sabich, isn't it?

219
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,742
Yeah.

220
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,704
[train horn honks]

221
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,798
- [patrons chattering]
- ["Guilt" playing on speakers]

222
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,220
[whispers] Barbara.

223
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,281
[line ringing]

224
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:29,369
[clears throat] Clifton,
it's, uh-- it's Barbara Sabich.

225
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,998
[Clifton] <i>Yeah. Oh, um,
I was hoping you'd call.</i>

226
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,710
[no audible dialogue]

227
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,884
I'm sorry. Th-This was a mistake.

228
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,302
This was a bad idea.

229
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:52,392
[Clifton] <i>Um, who-- who was it who said,
"We regret the ones we don't make"?</i>

230
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,334
[clears throat]

231
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,586
["Risk It All" playing on speakers]

232
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,864
Makes me feel safe.

233
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:31,283
Oof.

234
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,996
Isn't that bad in the art world?

235
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:39,499
[chuckles]

236
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,584
[Barbara] Not for me.

237
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:45,714
And honestly, safe has been
a little elusive for me lately.

238
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,307
Lewis Carroll.

239
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,434
What?

240
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:02,606
"In the end, the only choices
we regret are the ones we didn't take."

241
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:05,150
Thought it was Oscar Wilde.

242
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,949
Now I feel a little less safe.

243
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,287
I really don't want to be the one
to make the first move.

244
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,124
I don't want you to do anything
you don't want to.

245
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,792
Oh, I want.

246
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:24,670
[Clifton] Mmm.

247
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:28,966
I just shouldn't.

248
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,217
- [chuckles]
- Mmm.

249
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,054
But I want.

250
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,225
[inhaling deeply]

251
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,868
I had no involvement with that.

252
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,955
But you had an involvement with her,
Mr. Ratzer.

253
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,210
Your semen secretions
were found in her apartment.

254
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,587
But I wasn't there that night.

255
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:10,090
Oh, so you do have
memory of her after all?

256
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,010
You had sex with this woman?

257
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,138
Yeah, it's possible.

258
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:17,347
Possible?

259
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:26,023
Look, I had relations with prostitutes, okay?

260
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:29,318
You know, and, uh, she looks familiar,
all right?

261
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:30,402
[Brian sighs]

262
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,321
But look, hey... [stammers]

263
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,740
...I love my wife, okay? [stammers]

264
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:41,079
But after... [stammers] ...four children,
she had little to no interest in sex.

265
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,416
So, sometimes, yeah. Not often.

266
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,876
And this man?

267
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,758
Nah, I don't know him.
I've never seen him before.

268
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,468
[Mya] Are you sure?

269
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:58,180
[Brian scoffs] Yeah, I'm sure.

270
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:00,599
Why would I lie?

271
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,684
[Mya] Are you worried about
being implicated in her death,

272
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:08,482
{\an8}which maybe you already are,
since your DNA was found at the scene?

273
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,775
[Brian scoffs]

274
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,362
[sighs]

275
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,954
We know Liam Reynolds did this.

276
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:26,875
{\an8}If you do know this man,
now would be the time to tell us.

277
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,254
We're gonna have to pursue this further.

278
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:32,714
[chuckles] Look, I-I don't know this man,
all right?

279
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:33,966
We know you were there.

280
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:38,053
I've never seen him before and--
and I-- I had nothing to do with that.

281
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,195
[breathes heavily]

282
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:58,866
[chattering]

283
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,287
[officer 1] Arms out.

284
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,249
- [officer 2] Next.
- [officer 3] Turn around for me.

285
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,042
- [officer 1] That's good. In line.
- [officer 2] Morning.

286
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,127
[officer 1] You're all good.

287
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,547
[reporters clamoring]

288
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:15,716
[reporter] Mr. Molto,
can I get a quick comment on the record?

289
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:18,302
We understand that
there's been the tender of a plea.

290
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:20,971
This office will not be entertaining
any plea.

291
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:22,306
The defendant is accused of murder

292
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,266
and no lesser charge
will be so much as considered.

293
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,976
Beyond that,
we look forward to a fair trial

294
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,936
where we can exact
the appropriate measure of justice.

295
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,021
I'm sorry, that's all I got.

296
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:31,773
A-And what would
the appropriate measure of justice be?

297
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,859
[chattering]

298
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,612
[shutters clicking]

299
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:43,702
Actually...

300
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,081
I will say this.

301
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:52,586
There has been a grotesque
and systematic lack of accountability

302
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,506
that's been going on
for too long in this city.

303
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,090
Actually, I would say in this country.

304
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,595
Wall Street criminally plunged
innocent people into poverty

305
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,640
with their mortgage schemes,
and not one banker went to prison.

306
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,601
Pharmaceutical companies
prioritized profits

307
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,561
over patients' lives with their opioids.

308
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,313
No one from that industry went to prison.

309
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:15,567
So, the message has been sent
and received in America,

310
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:16,860
that if you're high enough,

311
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,112
you can do and get away
with just about anything.

312
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,615
Well, not anymore. No, sir.

313
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,700
[reporters clamoring]

314
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:32,626
Tommy, can-- can you tell me
how that was helpful to us?

315
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:35,879
Tommy.

316
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:39,842
- Tommy, I'm asking you a question.
- Just give me a second.

317
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:47,766
Okay.

318
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:49,518
[inhales sharply]

319
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:51,395
Uh...

320
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:57,109
I really appreciate the appointment.

321
00:21:58,694 --> 00:21:59,695
[sighs]

322
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,908
I'm really-- [exhales heavily]

323
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:06,827
I'm grateful for the appointment, really.

324
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:11,707
What I don't appreciate, and I won't
tolerate, is this low-grade distrust.

325
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,292
I'm-- I'm good at what I do.

326
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:17,212
Do-- Do you think I would
give you this case if I didn't think that?

327
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,758
Well, I know a lot of people
around here that have...

328
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,094
[chuckling]
...like, some kind of a problem with me.

329
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:26,722
And the reason is...

330
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,100
they're picking up on cues,

331
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,644
and not just from Raymond and Rusty,
but from you.

332
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,027
[Nico stammers] Tommy.

333
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:41,278
[sighs]

334
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:43,864
W-What's happened to you...

335
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,365
- [Tommy] For the record--
- ...in the last month?

336
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:46,450
For the record...

337
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,328
[smacks lips]

338
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,413
To have the best shot at conviction,

339
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:57,920
I need to cultivate respect
and goodwill from the jury pool, right?

340
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,547
That's why I made the statement.

341
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,300
I'm the good guy in all this.

342
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,386
Potential jurors, they need to know it
and better yet, they need to feel it.

343
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,681
They need to understand
that something is so

344
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:12,851
because Tommy Molto says it's so.

345
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,107
[shower running]

346
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,788
[reporter speaks
indistinctly through device]

347
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:35,582
- [Rusty] Jaden, it's 7:30, honey.
- Honey, is your bag ready?

348
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,084
I mean, it's right there.

349
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:39,419
[clears throat] Hey.

350
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:43,173
No murder trials at breakfast,
especially mine.

351
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:44,258
Turn it off.

352
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:47,261
I have a gigantic zit on my face.
Can you please tell me if it's cancerous?

353
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:48,512
- It is not.
- It's huge.

354
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:50,055
- It's probably stress.
- [Jaden] Are you sure?

355
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,640
Let me see. Let me look.

356
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,934
- You look nice. You have an interview?
- [Barbara] Thank you.

357
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:56,603
- Uh, therapy, actually.
- That's gotta be a brain tumor.

358
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,188
You're dressed like that
for your therapist?

359
00:23:58,188 --> 00:23:59,273
I am.

360
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,608
- She likes me to look pretty.
- Where is my phone?

361
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,152
I swea-- Can somebody call my phone?

362
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:06,446
- Will you ring your father's phone?
- [chuckles] I'll call it.

363
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,949
[Rusty] I swear to God that it's here.

364
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:10,284
- Ringing.
- [Kyle] There.

365
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:12,494
- [phone ringing]
- [utensil clinking]

366
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:13,662
[Jaden] Must be near.

367
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:17,457
Who is this?

368
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:18,542
This is Jaden.

369
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,586
[Rusty] What are you thinking?

370
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:22,212
Nothing.

371
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:23,380
I don't believe you.

372
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,552
[chuckles] This is nice.

373
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:29,636
That's it.

374
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:32,890
It is nice.

375
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,350
Can you tell your mom
she looks beautiful for me?

376
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,019
[chuckles] I can.

377
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:38,228
[chuckles]

378
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:40,355
- [Rusty] Okay. Bye, you guys.
- [Kyle] Bye.

379
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:41,648
[Barbara, Jaden] Bye.

380
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:51,909
[car alarm sounds]

381
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:04,671
- Stop touching. You're making it worse.
- [Jaden] I'm not touching it.

382
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:07,508
What-- W-Why is--
Why is Kyle's bike in the trash?

383
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:11,970
I don't know.
I-I-I didn't put it there, honey.

384
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,101
It is trash.

385
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:25,067
I mean, the gears are shot and the,
you know-- the chain keeps coming loose.

386
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,151
So I just--

387
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,035
Okay.

388
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,048
[grunts]

389
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:53,679
[keys jingling]

390
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,351
[breathing heavily]

391
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,483
[Dr. Rush] And this was when?

392
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:08,277
[Barbara] A week or so ago.

393
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:10,153
And we had a session last Monday.

394
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:13,615
Dr. Rush, can we please
not make this about untruths?

395
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,909
- I just can't--
- [Dr. Rush] No, no, I've-- No, I'm--

396
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:20,455
Oh, and-- and-- and clearly, you've--

397
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:25,127
[stammers] ...you've been considering having
an affair with him far longer than that.

398
00:26:27,546 --> 00:26:30,382
An aff-- [chuckles] It was just a kiss.

399
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:34,553
That wasn't...

400
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:37,431
just a kiss.

401
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:43,687
It sounds like it was a--
like it was a romance.

402
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,397
[chuckles]

403
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:50,736
Yeah.

404
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:53,572
Well, it was romantic.

405
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:56,408
- [Dr. Rush chuckles]
- [Barbara] <i>Deeply romantic.</i>

406
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:00,204
[sighs]

407
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:02,206
Maybe that is why...

408
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,334
you didn't tell me.

409
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:08,086
I don't know why I didn't tell you.
I-- [sighs]

410
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:15,511
I'm not ashamed.

411
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:18,180
I'm not.

412
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:21,600
[stammers, breathes heavily]

413
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:23,894
[sighs]

414
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:25,562
Knowing I could.

415
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:29,566
Knowing I was...

416
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:34,863
wanted.

417
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:43,413
Yeah.

418
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:49,586
Desired. I felt relieved.

419
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:57,636
You know...

420
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:03,725
when I was, um, at Clifton's place,

421
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:08,230
I was walking up the stairs,
and I remember thinking...

422
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,402
Jaden would be so proud of me.

423
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:16,572
- [chuckles]
- [Dr. Rush] Jaden?

424
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:20,576
I feel her--

425
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,622
[crying] I feel her judgment.

426
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,375
[sniffles]

427
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,463
And I-- [sniffles]

428
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:37,551
I mean, I could be projecting
because I judge myself...

429
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:38,760
[cries]

430
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:41,013
...for staying with him.

431
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,601
[cries] For forgiving him.

432
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:46,685
[sniffles]

433
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,565
For loving him. [sniffles]

434
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:59,323
Yeah, I could have fucked Clifton...
[sniffles] ...but I didn't.

435
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:04,995
[exhales heavily, sniffles]

436
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:08,707
So you tell me... [sniffles]

437
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:16,173
...is that something I should be proud of?

438
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,165
[Raymond] Hey.

439
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:53,502
Hey.

440
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:02,803
Listen, I'm--
I'm not saying it's unwinnable.

441
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:06,098
I can win this case, Rusty.

442
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:08,809
But you need to let me.

443
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:14,857
Can we allude to the son
or Liam Reynolds? Sure.

444
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:17,526
But our case is not somebody else did it,

445
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:19,778
or at least,
not somebody else specifically.

446
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:22,739
Our defense is that
they cannot prove you did it.

447
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:26,326
We need to establish
a credible alternative to me.

448
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,662
Otherwise it-- it's--

449
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,081
I disagree.

450
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:40,841
Does Barbara think you're guilty?

451
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:44,678
Of course not. What are you getting at?

452
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:46,096
Are you sure?

453
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:47,181
Yes, I'm sure.

454
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,273
Lorraine is 100% convinced
that you did it.

455
00:30:57,232 --> 00:30:59,234
Well, it's obviously not coming from me,

456
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:05,199
and she's not one to readily
believe what's reported in the news.

457
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,284
She and Barbara are close.

458
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:14,208
Barbara knows that I am innocent.

459
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:17,753
I hope so, 'cause this case,
it may come down to her.

460
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:19,963
How so? She can't establish an alibi.

461
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,924
[Raymond] She, as your wife,

462
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:23,717
- can attest to your demeanor...
- No, no...

463
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:25,844
- ...later that night. How you acted...
- ...no, no.

464
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:28,263
- behaved, whether you were agitated...
- We are not putting her on the stand.

465
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:29,431
...distracted.

466
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:30,766
- She could testify...
- No, Ray.

467
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:34,978
...from her very unique perspective
that you could not possibly have committed

468
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:38,065
- a murder in the hours before.
- [sighs]

469
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:43,487
That sends a message to everyone
watching that she believes in you.

470
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:45,405
She believes in your innocence.

471
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:49,117
That counts for something.

472
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:51,036
I know that much.

473
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:02,339
Also, it goes without saying,
but I'm gonna offer it all the same.

474
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,841
Between now and the trial,

475
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:06,969
let's not be beating anybody else up.

476
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,934
[reporter] <i>We're finally here.</i>

477
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:17,062
<i>Tomorrow, the trial that has not
only grabbed the attention of Chicago,</i>

478
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:19,106

479

[no audible dialogue]

487
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:03,979
All right.

488
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:06,815
Mr. Molto.

489
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:14,656
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
we already met during voir dire,

490
00:35:14,656 --> 00:35:16,575
but allow me to introduce myself again.

491
00:35:16,575 --> 00:35:17,826
My name is Tommasino Molto,

492
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,746
but I'm from Chicago like you,
so it's Tommy.

493
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:25,834
I'll be prosecuting the case along with
Mr. Nico Della Guardia, who you also met.

494
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:27,461
We represent the State.

495
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:30,047
We'll present to you evidence of a crime.

496
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:32,049
You will weigh this evidence,
you'll deliberate upon it

497
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:34,927
and, ultimately, you'll decide
if it proves the defendant's guilt.

498
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:37,763
This man is accused
in the murder of Carolyn Polhemus.

499
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:41,016
And we will present to you testimonial,
physical, scientific and forensic evidence

500
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:44,102
that will lead you to form a conclusion.

501
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:47,606
One word about the victim.

502
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:53,737
{\an8}I knew her.

503
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:55,906
{\an8}And we all knew her.

504
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:59,660
Um, she was a colleague
in the district attorney's office.

505
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:01,745
Loved by all.

506
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:06,917
From an evidence standpoint,
it shouldn't matter that I knew her.

507
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,544
Admired her. That I miss her.

508
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:10,462
That has no evidentiary meaning or value,

509
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,548
but I won't pretend
that it doesn't matter.

510
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:18,720
So if I show my feelings,
let me apologize for that right now.

511
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:24,101
Prosecutors are expected
to be tough, right?

512
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:25,185
Unfeeling.

513
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:27,062
Just functionary.

514
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:31,358
Well, we are functionaries
of the only universally accepted system

515
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:32,901
for distinguishing wrong from right.

516
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:34,236
We're bureaucrats.

517
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:38,866
I suppose you imagine that,
after years of making charges

518
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:42,452
and trying cases and seeing defendants
come and go, that we'd become inured.

519
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:44,705
It was all just a kind of blur.

520
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:48,667
Well, not today, because I did know her.

521
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:53,630
Today, you-- all of you--

522
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:57,551
have taken on one of the most solemn
obligations of citizenship,

523
00:36:57,551 --> 00:37:01,221
and your job is simply to find the truth.
The facts.

524
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:03,348
And it's not an easy task, as we all know.

525
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:08,103
As memories fail,
recollections become shaded

526
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:10,647
and evidence points
in different directions,

527
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:12,649
you might be forced to decide
about something

528
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:16,737
that no one seems to know
or be willing to say.

529
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:23,577
And the evidence, in this case,
the details are unspeakably gruesome.

530
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:28,874
I'm gonna show you an image.
It's quite violent.

531
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,168
[jury gasps]

532
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:35,547
Right. So if you were watching this
at home, you would turn it off,

533
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:38,258
not watch, not listen, not see this.

534
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:40,802
No one should have
to watch it or listen to it.

535
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:42,471
But here, you must.

536
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:45,974
You have to, right?

537
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:48,519
It's a real crime. It's a real victim.

538
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:50,687
Carolyn Polhemus.

539
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:54,483
And she had a son,

540
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:56,985
Michael.

541
00:37:58,904 --> 00:37:59,988
So there's real pain.

542
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:06,537
In the end, you don't have to try
to figure out why it happened.

543
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:09,331
A person's motives, after all,
may be forever locked away inside them.

544
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:13,669
But you do have to try
to determine what occurred.

545
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:18,423
Otherwise, we won't know whether or not
this man deserves to be freed or punished.

546
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:23,011
And if we can't find the truth,
what is the hope of justice?

547
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:26,557
That's why Carolyn
got into this line of work.

548
00:38:26,557 --> 00:38:29,726
That is why we all got
into this line of work.

549
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,436
Hope for justice.

550
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:37,818
So, in the end, I-- I won't be asking
you to cry for Carolyn, though you might.

551
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:42,072
And I won't be asking you
to feel for her family and her son.

552
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:43,240
Of course you will.

553
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:50,998
I simply implore you to be true.
To be faithful to the truth.

554
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:55,335
Which, Carolyn,
that's all she would have asked.

555
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:58,505
Just be faithful to the truth.

556
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:02,092
Thank you.

557
00:39:12,603 --> 00:39:13,687
[sighs]

558
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,315
Fuck.
