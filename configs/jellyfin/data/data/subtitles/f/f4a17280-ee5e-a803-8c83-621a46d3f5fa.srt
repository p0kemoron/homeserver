00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:57,081
Thank you, Bernard. Show him in.

4
00:00:57,286 --> 00:00:59,356
Yes, Prime Minister.

5
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:07,044
- Good morning, Prime Minister.
- Ah, Humphrey, good morning.

00:01:07,246 --> 00:01:09,237
How's the jet lag?

7
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:15,318
I'm not jet-lagged. No, I find that jet lag
affects me more going the other way.

8
00:01:15,966 --> 00:01:20,994
I felt frightfully tired at the White House.
I can scarcely remember a thing he said.

9
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:25,324
He didn't really say much, Prime Minister.
He was frightfully tired too.

10
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:30,358
Bit worrying, isn't it? Statesmen such as myself
jetting all over the world,

11
00:01:30,526 --> 00:01:35,202
attending major conferences on the future
of mankind and we're zonked?

12
00:01:35,406 --> 00:01:37,795
It would be, Prime Minister.

13
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:42,960
Perhaps that's why negotiations are done
in advance by humble servants such as I.

14
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:46,558
They can hardly be left
in the hands of the zonked.

15
00:01:47,246 --> 00:01:49,760
Now, what did you want to see me about?

16
00:01:51,326 --> 00:01:53,920
Prime Minister? Prime Minister!

17
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:57,402
Ah, yes, Bernard. Ah, Humphrey, good morning!

18
00:01:59,446 --> 00:02:02,722
- You wanted to see me.
- Oh. Did I?

00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:07,763
- Don't you know what it was about?
- He fell asleep before he told me.

..about something.

25
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:30,275
I suppose now I'm back,
I've got a huge backlog of work?

26
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:32,841
- Not really.
- No backlog?

27
00:02:33,046 --> 00:02:38,518
Nothing at all. You have much less to do
as Prime Minister. You don't have a department.

28
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:41,115
Bernard, you can't be serious.

29
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:46,280
Everything you've read about how hard a Prime
Minister has to work is a bit of a myth really.

30
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:49,563
It's put out by the Press Office
as a matter of course.

31
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:52,524
If you think about it, what do you have to do?

32
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:55,718
- Chair the Cabinet.
- Two and a half hours a week.

33
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:59,003
- Chair a couple of Cabinet committees.
- Four hours.

00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:03,159
- Answer questions in the House twice a week.
- Another half an hour.

- Audience with the Queen on Tuesdays.

36
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:09,078
- Another hour.
- Seven and a half hours a week so far.

37
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:12,964
Bernard, there must be more to it than that.

00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:18,120
You have to read all the briefs and we rush you
from place to place shaking hands with people.

39

There's lots of things people want you to do
and lots of things you should do

40
00:03:22,926 --> 00:03:27,317

but very few things you HAVE to do.

straight away, please.

- Was it?
- 0f course it was, Bernard.

47
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:53,000

I just told you.

52
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:09,398
No, what about agreements with the Americans?

53
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:14,037
Your private conversation with the President?
You didn't tell me the result.

54
00:04:14,206 --> 00:04:18,722
Oh, that. To begin with, I read him my brief
and he read me his brief.

55
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:23,880
Then we decided it would be quicker if we just
swapped briefs and read them to ourselves.

Ah, Bernard. How's the Prime Minister
and First Lord of the Treasury?

64
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:58,005
- Sleeping peacefully, Sir Humphrey.
- Bernard, we have a problem.

65
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:01,363
- Who has?
- You and I and the whole of Whitehall.

66
00:05:01,526 --> 00:05:05,519
The problem is the Prime Minister's
disastrous new defence ideas -

67
00:05:05,686 --> 00:05:09,679
cancelling Trident,
reintroducing conscription and all that rubbish.

68
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,124
- The Grand Design?
- That's what he calls it.

69
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:17,279
- If it reduces unemployment...
- What is the purpose of our defence policy?

70
00:05:17,446 --> 00:05:19,914
- To defend Britain.
- No, Bernard.

71
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,078
It is to make people BELIEVE Britain is defended.

72
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:27,920
- The Russians?
- Not the Russians, the British!

73
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:31,081
The Russians know it's not.

- Bernard, we have a magic wand - Trident.

Nobody understands anything about it,
except that it will cost £15 billion,

79
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:54,680
which means it must be wonderful, magical.

All we have to do is write a cheque
and then we can all relax,

but if people in government start talking about it,

82
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:05,640
in the end, they'll start THINKING about it.

83
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:10,239
They will come to realise the problems,
the flaws in the reasoning.

84
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:15,241
The nation will get worried -
agitation, questions, criticism...change.

- Change?
- Change.

86
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:24,243
There is one thing, though - this TV broadcast.
Suppose he uses it to announce his new policy?

87
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:29,201
- It has to go through Cabinet and the House.
- He can open the national debate.

88
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:33,081
You do not do that
until the government has made up its mind.

89
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:36,801
- If the Prime Minister has made up his mind...
- He must unmake it.

- But he's the Prime Minister.
- Yes, indeed he is, Bernard.

91

He has his own car, a nice house in London,
endless publicity and a pension for life.

Well, stop him, Bernard.

95
00:06:56,286 --> 00:06:58,675

No, Prime Minister, it has to be one or the other.

Bernard, we're discussing a TV interview.

- It depends how you want to appear.

102
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:24,401

- They won't all interview you at the same time.

No, I want to be seen to have all those qualities.

104
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:31,039
Well, I think you should do it to camera.

105
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:36,200
Yes. At least it'll be me in charge and not
all those failed MPs and jumped-up DJs.

106
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,954
- Fine. A party political?
- No, a party political spells instant boredom.

107
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:46,519
I think it should be a ministerial broadcast,
the Prime Minister addressing his people,

108
00:07:46,686 --> 00:07:49,678
but I'll do it into the camera like a party political.

109
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:54,357
- I thought you said they were boring.
- I didn't say I'D be boring, Bernard.

110
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:57,321
Do you think I'd be boring?

111
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:01,997
Boring? You?

112
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:05,915
- Have you done much talking to camera?
- No, mostly interviews.

113
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:10,762
Then I'd better set up a practice session.
What is the broadcast to be about?

114
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:15,076
- About?
- Yes, about. What will it be about?

115
00:08:15,846 --> 00:08:18,121
About me.

116
00:08:18,326 --> 00:08:20,681
Yes, but what are you gonna say?

117
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:22,438
Say?

118
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:24,637
About policies.

119
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:29,800
Policies, yes. I thought it'd be the usual thing -
go forward together, better tomorrow,

120
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:33,595
tighten your belt, all pull together,
heal the wounds.

121
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:37,279
Yes, but what will you be saying specifically?

122
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:40,635
Oh, specifically.

123
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:45,322
Well, I thought I'd suggest
that we all specifically tighten our belts.

124
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:50,842
And specifically heal the specific wounds
in society. See what I mean?

125
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:56,404
It's entirely up to you, Prime Minister. I just
thought if you had anything new to say...?

126
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:58,158
New?

127
00:08:58,326 --> 00:09:02,604
Oh, new! Yes, of course!
Get Humphrey back here, will you?

128
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:06,475
My Grand Design. That's what I wanted
to talk to Humphrey about.

129
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:11,439
Sir Humphrey, the Prime Minister
is making arrangements for his TV broadcast.

130
00:09:11,606 --> 00:09:15,121
He wants to talk about his Grand Design
and wonders if you...

131
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:18,605
Hello?

132
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,155
I think he's on his way.

133
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:25,279
- Grand Design?
- I can't tell you now, but it's a big story.

134
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:30,002
I'll find a producer and set up
a practice session in the meantime.

135
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:37,763
- That was quick.
- You want to discuss a TV appearance?

136
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:40,360
Yes. It's not so desperately urgent.

137
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:42,676
Not remotely important.

138
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:46,037
My first television broadcast as Prime Minister?

139
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:50,524
Terribly important, of course,
but not a crisis, not a panic.

140
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:54,036
I want to announce my new defence policy.
What do you think?

141
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:56,197
- No!
- Pardon?

142
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:58,476
- It's a mistake.
- The policy?

143
00:09:58,686 --> 00:10:03,476
Well, of course, it's tremendously refreshing
to have a new mind on the problem.

144
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:08,640
Challenging the old ideas, questioning the whole
basis of government thinking for 30 years.

145
00:10:08,846 --> 00:10:11,838
- You don't approve of the policy?
- It's not that.

146
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:14,998
There'll be implications,
reverberations, repercussions.

147
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,760
We have to weigh the evidence, review, consult.

148
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:21,163
You get on with that
and I'll announce it in the broadcast.

149
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:23,926
You can't. Not yet.

150
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:28,284
Well, we have to tell the Americans.
They will have grave objections.

151
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:33,520
It will take many months of patient diplomacy.
Delicate issues need sensitive handling.

152
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:37,719
Who is it who has the last word
about the government of Britain?

153
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:40,798
The British Cabinet or the American President?

154
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:43,560
Do you know, that's a fascinating question!

155
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:48,274
- We often discuss it.
- What conclusion have you arrived at?

156
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:53,276
Well, I must admit to being a bit of a heretic.
I think it's the British Cabinet, but...

157
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:55,835
I know I'm in the minority.

158
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:58,435
From now on, you're in the majority.

159
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:02,394
I shall raise my Grand Design
with the 0verseas Defence Committee,

160
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:04,875
then I shall put it to Cabinet.

161
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:07,514
I've sounded most of them out privately.

162
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:11,679
They think it's a vote-winner...
a major contribution to our defence.

163
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:15,236
I'll put it to the House,
then announce it in my broadcast.

164
00:11:15,446 --> 00:11:19,439
- Sorry, you can't announce it yet.
- Well, if I can't, who can?

165
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:25,238
So let us be abundantly clear about this.

166
00:11:25,846 --> 00:11:29,122
We cannot go on paying ourselves
more than we earn.

167
00:11:29,726 --> 00:11:32,320
The rest of the world does not owe us a living.

168
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:37,602
We must be prepared to make sacrifices and...
Who wrote this rubbish?

169
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:43,916
You did, Prime Minister.
It's one of your old speeches.

170
00:11:44,086 --> 00:11:47,556
- What about a draft of the broadcast?
- It's still only a draft.

171
00:11:47,726 --> 00:11:50,160
- This is only a practice.
- It's confidential.

172
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:53,517
- Everyone's been cleared. Go on.
- Yes, Prime Minister.

173
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:57,719
- How was that, Godfrey?
- Excellent, Prime Minister. Just one thing.

174
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:01,956
- Will you be wearing those glasses?
- What do you think?

175
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:06,517
It's up to you. With them on,
you look authoritative and commanding.

176
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:09,480
With them off, you look honest and open.

177
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:12,200
I want to look authoritative AND honest.

178
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:14,874
It's one or the other really.

179
00:12:15,086 --> 00:12:18,920
I could start with them off
and put them on when I talk?

180
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:22,038
- That just looks indecisive.
- Oh, I see.

181
00:12:22,246 --> 00:12:24,441
What about a monocle?

182
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:32,881
Let's just leave them off for the moment,
shall we? Can we go again?

183
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,761
- Have you got that new script, Bernard?
- Yes, Prime Minister.

184
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:40,236
The Trident programme is too expensive.

185
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:44,243
By cancelling it, we shall release billions of pounds

186
00:12:44,406 --> 00:12:48,365
to fund an imaginative and radical attack
on the nation's problems.

187
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:52,117
- What this country needs...
- Can we hold it?

188
00:12:52,286 --> 00:12:55,278
- What was wrong?
- No, it was very good.

189
00:12:55,446 --> 00:12:58,119
- Prime Minister...
- Just a minute. Yes?

190
00:12:58,326 --> 00:13:03,320
Do you mind not leaning forward? It makes
you look as though you're selling insurance.

191
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:07,638
And also it makes you look up at the lens
like a sort of suppliant.

192
00:13:07,806 --> 00:13:10,479
You should be looking down from on high.

193
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,522
What this country needs...
What this country needs...

194
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:18,676
What this country needs...

195
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:23,721
Prime Minister, Malcolm and I have drafted
a slightly different version to this speech.

196
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:28,716
''We shall review a wide range of options
over the whole field of government expenditure.''

197
00:13:28,886 --> 00:13:31,878
- This doesn't say anything.
- Thank you, Prime Minister.

198
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:34,514
- Completely lacking impact.
- You're too kind.

199
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:38,599
- No, I don't like it.
- You could say ''urgently review''.

200
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:42,236
- No.
- I do think it should be toned down a bit.

201
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,596
Any thoughts, Malcolm?

202
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:49,157
What about ''the Trident programme
is a heavy burden on your tax bill.

203
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:53,638
''We should look at it carefully
to see if it merits the £15 billion it costs.''

204
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,721
All right. It's 0K to mention figures?

205
00:13:57,406 --> 00:14:01,877
Yes. Practically no one takes them in
and those who do don't believe them,

206
00:14:02,046 --> 00:14:06,039
but it makes people think
you've got the facts at your fingertips.

207
00:14:06,206 --> 00:14:09,198
People don't know
you're reading them off the teleprompter.

208
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:12,358
- 0therwise, it was fine?
- You were going a bit slowly.

209
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:15,126
The teleprompter was going a bit slowly.

210
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:19,922
No, no. It follows your speed.
Try going slow and then fast.

211
00:14:20,086 --> 00:14:22,441
- Oh, I see.
- And cue.

212
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:26,360
The...Trident...programme...is...a...heavy...

213
00:14:26,526 --> 00:14:30,519
(VERY QUICKLY) ..burden on your tax bill.
£15 billion is a lot of money.

214
00:14:30,686 --> 00:14:32,961
I see what you mean, yes.

215
00:14:35,326 --> 00:14:38,159
Would you mind not saying ''YOur tax bill''?

216
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:40,004
Why not?

217
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:44,523
It makes you sound like the ruler
talking to the ruled, them and us.

218
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:48,878
- What should I say?
- ''Our tax bill''? You pay taxes, too.

219
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:52,601
- Yes. Change that, Bernard.
- It's still very direct.

220
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:57,317
- Good. Thank you, Bernard.
- No, lots of people's jobs depend on Trident.

221
00:14:57,486 --> 00:15:00,637
- Until there's been a consultation...
- Yes. Malcolm?

222
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:05,840
We could say, ''Defence expenditure is one
of those areas which we will look at closely

223
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:09,442
''to see if we can meet our defence needs
at a lower cost.''

224
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:12,279
- Can you make it two sentences?
- Why?

225
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:17,196
Prime Minister, we find
that if a sentence goes on over three lines,

226
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:22,599
then by the time it gets to the end,
most people will have forgotten how it began.

227
00:15:22,806 --> 00:15:25,036
Two sentences, Malcolm.

228
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:27,959
And you are leaning forward again a bit.

229
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:31,604
That's what I do when I want to look sincere.

230
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:35,594
It makes you look like someone
who wants to look sincere.

231
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:39,438
If you lean back, you look relaxed and in control.

232
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:41,159
That's it.

233
00:15:42,966 --> 00:15:47,756
Don't lean back quite as far as that.
It looks as though you've had a liquid lunch.

234
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:54,037
You can always underline bits of the script
where you want to look sincere,

235
00:15:54,206 --> 00:15:57,278
then you just frown
and say them a bit more slowly.

236
00:15:57,486 --> 00:15:59,556
Anything else?

237
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:02,115
Well, your face is a bit wooden.

238
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:04,125
Wooden?

239
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:06,754
Yeah, only when you're speaking.

240
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:11,716
In normal speech, you move your head
and eyebrows and cheek muscles and so on.

241
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:15,674
Don't let the teleprompter
turn you into a zombie. 0K? And cue!

242
00:16:15,846 --> 00:16:19,202
Defence expenditure is one of the areas...

243
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:23,117
which this government will be examining closely.

244
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:26,997
It may be that we can achieve the same...

245
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:31,159
Prime Minister, that's just a little bit too much.

246
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:36,959
You'll have heard a lot of nonsense
from the opposition.

247
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:39,276
They say we waste money.

248
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:42,279
They say we're selling out to the United States.

249
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:45,643
I say look at the mess they made
when they were in power,

250
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:48,525
look at the damage they did to the economy...

251
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:53,720
Could we hold it there? Prime Minister,
if I might suggest, don't attack the opposition.

252
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:56,679
Oh. Those are the bits the party likes.

253
00:16:56,846 --> 00:16:59,314
Now, the party will vote for you anyway.

254
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:04,037
You'll make the floating voter see you
as an angry and divisive figure.

255
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:08,199
- I see. What should I say about them?
- Don't mention them at all.

256
00:17:08,366 --> 00:17:12,154
Everything you say
has to make you sound warm and friendly.

257
00:17:12,326 --> 00:17:15,124
Authoritative, of course, but affectionate.

258
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:17,516
The father of the nation.

259
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:21,440
Could we just run forward to that, um,
that new bit?

260
00:17:22,646 --> 00:17:26,195
Try lowering the pitch of your voice. All right?

261
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:31,235
(HIGH V0ICE) We want...

262
00:17:31,406 --> 00:17:35,194
(DEEP V0ICE) We want to build
a bright future for our children.

263
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:38,881
We want to build
a peaceful and prosperous Britain,

264
00:17:39,046 --> 00:17:42,834
a Britain that can hold her head high
in the fellowship of nations.

265
00:17:43,006 --> 00:17:45,520
This is rather good. Who wrote this?

266
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:50,356
Actually, it's from the last party political
by the leader of the opposition.

267
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:55,199
As for your appearance, what will you wear?

268
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:59,604
- What do you suggest?
- A dark suit represents traditional values.

269
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:02,963
- Fine, dark suit.
- But a light suit looks business-like.

270
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,363
What about a lightish jacket
with a darkish waistcoat?

271
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:10,834
I think that would look
as though you've got an identity problem.

272
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:15,602
Excuse me, Prime Minister.
Godfrey, could we have a word about make-up?

273
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:20,961
- Shall we darken the grey hair?
- No, it's fine.

274
00:18:21,126 --> 00:18:24,243
- And the receding hairline?
- Receding what?

275
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:26,836
High forehead.

276
00:18:27,726 --> 00:18:34,040
And can you try to do something about the eyes,
make them look less close-set?

277
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:35,685
Sure.

278
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,834
Lighten the bags underneath.

279
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,839
- The nose is still a problem.
- Problem?

280
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:47,881
No, just a lighting problem, Prime Minister.
A very large, um, shadow.

281
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,315
The teeth, of course.

282
00:18:53,526 --> 00:18:55,994
Could you smile, Prime Minister?

283
00:18:58,126 --> 00:18:59,764
Yes...

284
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:10,041
Prime Minister, how would you feel
about a little dental work?

285
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:12,481
Can we get on with this?

286
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:14,796
0K, we're going again.

287
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:17,560
Super. And cue the Prime Minister.

288
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:23,557
We shall review a wide range of options over
the whole field of government expenditure...

289
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:28,516
- Bernard, this is what we started with.
- I do think it's the most appropriate.

290
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:32,474
- What do you think, Godfrey?
- It's up to you, Prime Minister.

291
00:19:32,646 --> 00:19:35,638
All I can say is,
if that's what you're going to say,

292
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:38,445
I suggest a very modern suit, hi-tech furniture,

293
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:41,723
high-energy yellow wallpaper, abstract paintings.

294
00:19:41,886 --> 00:19:46,038
In fact, everything to disguise
the absence of anything new in the speech.

295
00:19:46,246 --> 00:19:50,034
I'll go back to my original dynamic speech
about the Grand Design.

296
00:19:50,206 --> 00:19:54,996
Fine, then it's the reassuring traditional
background, dark suit, oak panelling,

297
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,634
leather volumes, 18th-century portraits.

298
00:19:57,806 --> 00:20:00,195
One other thing - opening music.

299
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:04,598
Once again, Bach - new ideas;
Stravinsky - no change.

300
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:10,082
I think I ought to have a British composer,
something that would reflect my image.

301
00:20:10,246 --> 00:20:13,044
- Elgar perhaps?
- Elgar, yes, yes.

302
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:15,595
Not ''Land of Hope and Glory''.

303
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,434
What about the ''Enigma Variations''?

304
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:23,718
He's going to say something new and radical.

305
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:28,681
That silly Grand Design? Bernard,
that was precisely what you had to avoid!

306
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:31,599
I shall need a very good explanation!

307
00:20:31,806 --> 00:20:35,276
- He's very keen on it.
- What's that got to do with it?

308
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:39,644
Things don't happen just because
Prime Ministers are keen on them.

309
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:42,320
Neville Chamberlain was very keen on peace!

310
00:20:43,886 --> 00:20:46,684
He thinks it's a vote-winner.

311
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:50,998
Ah. That's more serious. Sit down.
What makes him think that?

312
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:55,597
The party did an opinion poll and all
the voters were in favour of national service.

313
00:20:55,806 --> 00:21:00,118
Have another opinion poll done
showing they're AGAINST national service.

314
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:03,602
- They can't be for AND against it.
- Ever been surveyed?

315
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:07,315
Yes. Well, not me, my house.
Oh, I see what you mean.

316
00:21:07,486 --> 00:21:10,284
Bernard, a nice young lady comes up to you.

317
00:21:10,446 --> 00:21:14,917
You want to create a good impression,
you don't want to look a fool, do you?

318
00:21:15,086 --> 00:21:18,078
- No.
- So she starts asking you some questions.

319
00:21:18,246 --> 00:21:22,842
Mr Woolley, are you worried about the number
of young people without jobs?

320
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:24,765
Yes.

321
00:21:24,926 --> 00:21:27,918
Are you worried about rising crime
among teenagers?

322
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:31,118
- Yes.
- Do you think our schools lack discipline?

323
00:21:31,286 --> 00:21:32,765
Yes.

324
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:36,396
Do you think young people welcome
authority and leadership?

325
00:21:36,606 --> 00:21:38,756
- Yes.
- They like a challenge?

326
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:41,924
- Yes.
- Would you be in favour of national service?

327
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:47,834
- I suppose I might be.
- Yes or no?

328
00:21:48,046 --> 00:21:51,959
- Yes.
- After all you've told me, you can't say no.

329
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,315
They don't mention the first five questions
and publish the last one.

330
00:21:56,526 --> 00:21:58,835
Is that really what they do?

331
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:02,316
Not the reputable ones,
but there aren't many of those.

332
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:05,796
Alternatively,
the young lady can get the opposite result.

333
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:09,237
- How?
- Mr Woolley, are you worried about war?

334
00:22:09,446 --> 00:22:11,960
- Yes.
- Are you worried about the arms race?

335
00:22:12,126 --> 00:22:16,039
- Yes.
- Is it dangerous giving young people guns?

336
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:19,841
- Yes.
- Is it wrong to force people to take up arms?

337
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:24,039
- Yes.
- Would you oppose national service?

338
00:22:24,246 --> 00:22:25,725
Yes.

339
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:31,364
There you are, you see, Bernard.
The perfect balanced sample.

340
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:37,157
So we just commission our own survey
for the Ministry of Defence. See to it.

341
00:22:37,326 --> 00:22:40,318
- What about the broadcast?
- When will he do it?

342
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:42,602
Some time next month.

343
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:45,155
Tell him it'll be in 11 days' time.

344
00:22:45,326 --> 00:22:48,204
That's a bit soon. Suppose he refuses?

345
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:52,154
Tell him that we've learnt
from the Joint Broadcasting Committee

346
00:22:52,326 --> 00:22:55,762
that the opposition will hold
a party political in 18 days' time

347
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:58,315
and he can get his ministerial in first.

348
00:22:58,486 --> 00:23:03,514
If he wants the first political broadcast of his
premiership to be given by the opposition, fine.

349
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:06,836
Erm, is that true?

350
00:23:07,046 --> 00:23:11,039
It will be...
if you don't mention it till tomorrow.

351
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:14,716
- He could still announce his new policy.
- I don't think so.

352
00:23:14,886 --> 00:23:18,003
He'll have only one meeting
with his Cabinet colleagues.

353
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:20,401
They're all in favour of it.

354
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:26,203
Only personally and politically, but are they
in favour as responsible departmental ministers?

355
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,443
I see. That will depend on the advice they get.

356
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:39,881
I understand, of course, there's no question
of our opposing this scheme to cancel Trident.

357
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:45,080
It's a question of holding back a little until
we've thought through all the implications.

358
00:23:45,246 --> 00:23:49,125
So what are you going to brief your man
at Employment to say?

359
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:51,681
What are the others saying?

360
00:23:51,846 --> 00:23:55,839
Will Dick brief the Foreign Secretary
to say the Americans will hit the roof?

361
00:23:56,006 --> 00:23:58,804
No, he thinks it might be more persuasive

362
00:23:58,966 --> 00:24:04,120
to argue that cancelling Trident
will look like weakness, appeasing the Soviets.

363
00:24:04,806 --> 00:24:06,797
Good thinking.

364
00:24:06,966 --> 00:24:09,434
Just as Norman won't tell his man at Defence

365
00:24:09,606 --> 00:24:14,316
to say that the service chiefs won't have
their elite forces diluted with riff-raff.

366
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:18,445
- But they won't?
- He felt they needed another argument.

367
00:24:18,646 --> 00:24:24,835
Two? Two arguments? Isn't that putting rather
a strain on the Defence Secretary's somewhat...

368
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,322
0bsolete intellectual equipment? Yes.

369
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:34,437
He's just going to brief him that Trident
is best and Britain must have the best.

370
00:24:34,646 --> 00:24:39,117
Oh, good. Even the Defence Secretary
should be able to handle that.

371
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:41,715
With a bit of coaching, yes.

372
00:24:41,886 --> 00:24:43,877
And Giles? I know!

373
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:48,836
The National Union of Teachers are scared stiff
that conscription will expose the fact

374
00:24:49,006 --> 00:24:54,080
that school leavers, while tremendously
integrated socially and creatively aware...

375
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:57,278
Can't actually read, write or do sums, yes.

376
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:01,034
Giles has got the Education Secretary worried

377
00:25:01,206 --> 00:25:05,677
that the colleges prefer their education
to be taken over by the services

378
00:25:05,846 --> 00:25:08,314
and actually used for teaching people.

379
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:13,763
- We can't have that.
- No. So what about your man at Employment?

380
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:15,996
It's the same problem.

381
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:20,444
The truth is the unions don't want
kids undercutting them on community work.

382
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:21,965
Yes.

383
00:25:22,126 --> 00:25:25,516
I don't think we need
to bring the truth in at this stage.

384
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:29,003
Hold on.

385
00:25:29,606 --> 00:25:31,836
Now, suppose he argues

386
00:25:32,006 --> 00:25:35,078
that unemployed young people are, at the moment,

387
00:25:35,246 --> 00:25:38,397
unfit, unorganised, undisciplined and untrained,

388
00:25:38,566 --> 00:25:43,321
but that conscription
will eventually release on to the streets

389
00:25:43,486 --> 00:25:47,240
an army of fit young people, all trained to kill.

390
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:49,877
Good man!

391
00:25:50,646 --> 00:25:53,035
Does he actually believe that?

392
00:25:53,206 --> 00:25:55,595
He will by tomorrow morning.

393
00:25:58,086 --> 00:26:00,077
Ah, Humphrey.

394
00:26:00,246 --> 00:26:02,237
Gentlemen. Sorry.

395
00:26:03,726 --> 00:26:05,717
Good committee, Prime Minister?

396
00:26:05,886 --> 00:26:08,798
- Extraordinary. Extraordinary.
- How extraordinary?

397
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:12,476
Last week, all my colleagues
were all for my Grand Design.

398
00:26:12,646 --> 00:26:14,318
And now?

399
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:17,478
The Foreign Secretary says
it would appease the Soviets.

400
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:20,035
I hadn't thought of that.

401
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:24,285
The Defence Secretary says Trident is best
and Britain must have the best.

402
00:26:24,486 --> 00:26:27,125
Does he really? How fascinating!

403
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:32,636
The Education Secretary says conscription
would undermine the educational system.

404
00:26:32,806 --> 00:26:35,559
It is a worry. And the Employment Secretary?

405
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:42,205
Well, he goes on about a million unemployed
trained fighters being let loose on the streets.

406
00:26:42,406 --> 00:26:45,796
- Well, he has a point there.
- I don't understand it.

407
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:51,359
Last week, they all thought my new defence
policy was a winner. Can you explain it?

408
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:54,034
It's beyond me, Prime Minister. Yes, Bernard?

409
00:26:54,206 --> 00:26:57,835
Sorry to interrupt, Prime Minister.
The MoD said it was urgent.

410
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:01,039
What?

411
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:05,034
It seems that 74%
of the population are against conscription.

412
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:09,280
74...? Good Lord!

413
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:14,802
The party poll said
that 63% of the population was for it.

414
00:27:16,326 --> 00:27:19,875
You see, party figures can be very unreliable,
Prime Minister.

415
00:27:20,046 --> 00:27:22,799
- Evidently.
- May I suggest a compromise?

416
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:28,720
Well, it's clear that the committee's agreed
that your new policy is an excellent plan,

417
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:31,354
but in view of some of the doubts expressed,

418
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:36,520
may I propose that after careful consideration,
the considered view of the committee was

419
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:40,076
that while the proposal met
with broad approval in principle,

420
00:27:40,246 --> 00:27:44,034
some of the principles
were sufficiently fundamental in principle

421
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:48,404
and some of the considerations
so complex and finely balanced in practice

422
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:52,684
that in principle it was proposed
that the sensible and prudent practice

423
00:27:52,846 --> 00:27:56,634
would be to submit the proposal
for more detailed consideration,

424
00:27:56,806 --> 00:28:01,197
stressing the essential continuity
of the new proposal with existing principles

425
00:28:01,366 --> 00:28:03,834
and the principle of the principal arguments

426
00:28:04,006 --> 00:28:08,477
which the proposer proposes and propounds
for their approval...in principle.

427
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:11,444
What?

428
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:15,685
Don't refer to your Grand Design
in your television broadcast on Friday.

429
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:19,961
- You're not suggesting I should abandon it?
- Good heavens, no!

430
00:28:20,126 --> 00:28:22,594
Heaven forbid! It is a most excellent policy!

431
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:27,034
All right. We'll look into it further
before I say anything about it.

432
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:32,115
The TV people want a decision about
the background scenery for the broadcast.

433
00:28:32,286 --> 00:28:38,156
I suppose it had better be the modern suit with
the hi-tech furniture and the yellow wallpaper.

434
00:28:38,326 --> 00:28:40,476
And abstract paintings?

435
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:43,280
I suppose so. And Stravinsky?

436
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:45,954
(B0TH) Yes, Prime Minister.
