00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:11,887
<i>My name is Rusty Sabich,
and I am the prosecutor in this trial.</i>

2
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,809
Sitting over there is the accused,
James McDavid, and I can tell you

3
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,270
that he sits there not guilty

4
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,398
because that is what
our constitution demands.

5
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:27,361
Now, I will present evidence to show you
that the accused committed this crime.

6
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,613
And should you find that to be likely--

7
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,991
likely-- you got to vote not guilty.

8
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:38,664
Should you find that to be very likely,
you have to set him free.

9
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:43,126
My job is to prove guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt...

10
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:48,131
and being on a jury,
that is a high calling.

11
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:52,135
And being entrusted with the prosecution,
satisfying the burden of proof,

12
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,637
that is also a high calling.

13
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:59,518
I will live up to my duty,
and I ask that you rise up to yours.

14
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,897
Let's do our jobs, shall we?

15
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,733
["Handclapping Song" playing]

16
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:13,699
That's way high.

17
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,868
Way, way, way high. Come on.

18
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,536
Give me some more.
Just focus. Take a breath.

19
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,246
Hey, just take a breath.

20
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,248
You're rushing it all. Just breathe.

21
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,541
How's it going out there?

22
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,500
[Rusty] Whoa, nice.

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,128
I heard something about runners
on second and third.

24
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,005
Whoa, not the testicles!

25
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,131
- [laughs]
- [Rusty] Nasty!

26
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:32,176
Hey, guys,
I thought we said no curveballs.

27
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,261
[Rusty] Let the boy pitch, hon.
Just let the boy pitch.

28
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,387
- Dad.
- [Rusty] Yeah?

29
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,847
It's Raymond.

30
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,809
You threw a couple great ones today.

31
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,019
[grunts]

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,980
There must be some new poll out
or something.

33
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,523
You have got to be kidding me.

34
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,941
[teen] Daddy suggested it.

35
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:49,735
[Rusty] Hey.

36
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,496
When?

37
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,626
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll be right-- I'll be right there.

38
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,711
[breathing shakily]

39
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,964
Barbara, can I talk to you for a second?

40
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,425
Yeah. Sure.

41
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,813
Yeah?

42
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,609
Carolyn Polhemus was murdered.

00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,281
Wh-Wh-When?

45
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,368
I don't know. I have to-- I'm gonna--
I have to go. I'll be back.

00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,254

[camera shutter clicks]

49
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,707
You don't wanna go in there. It's bad.

50
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,170
{\an8}All right. Make sure you glove up.

51
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,635
[shutter clicking]

52
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:12,836
[door closes]

53
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,561
I should take the case,

54
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,481
'cause something of this stature
should be either Rusty or me,

55
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,733
- and Rusty's too close.
- No, I need to be in charge.

56
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,318
A-And why is that, exactly?

57
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,320
Well, first of all,
because Raymond asked me to be,

58
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,365
and he still is the district attorney,
Nico, however much you want that title.

59
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,534
And second, I'm better than Tommy, so...

60
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:47,079
Okay, look. For the record,
until I win the election--

61
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,499
and I'm going to win-- I will remain
your loyal and trusted servant.

62
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,417
It's Rusty's case, all right?

63
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,546
Tommy, you cannot see straight on things.
Admit it.

64
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,799
Your view is likely obstructed
by Nico's sphincter.

65
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,843
- You dismiss me at your peril.
- [Raymond] Fuck off.

66
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:05,347
I just want the best lawyer for the job,
and it's Rusty.

67
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,515
[sighs]

68
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,185
Eugenia, can you, uh,
please ask Rigo to meet me in my office?

69
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,103
Okay, yeah.

70
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,985
Oh, fuck.

71
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,612
- [scoffs]
- I know.

72
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,906
I know.

73
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,994
Oh, Jesus Christ.

74
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,747
Rigo, what do you got?

75
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,542
Um, PD's on forensics,

00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,752

00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,129
Where are we starting?

78
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,089
Uh, recent releases. TCS parolees.

79
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,509
Jesus.

80
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,512
- You think it was revenge?
- I don't know. Who knows?

81
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,555
I don't-- I don't know.

82
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,433
Um, when the labs come in,

83
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,560
can you just make sure
that they-- they come only to me?

84
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,312
To me only. Not to Molto or Delay.

85
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,942
Yeah, you got it.

Thank you.

117
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,351
How are we doing?

118
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,604
Same as you, I guess.

119
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,189
You know anything more?

120
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,149
No, not much, but I got Rigo on it.

121
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,109
You know, the clock is ticking on this,

122
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,320
and my expiration date
is in the crosshairs.

123
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,281
Oh, well, don't worry.
We're gonna find out who did this.

124
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,657
Who's our ME?

- Raymond.

128
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,000
- Delay.
- I don't like being called that.

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,543
Just a joke.

00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,128
This press conference, Nico.

131
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,047
Please, can we not do this right here?

132
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:28,258
Fuck off. Teeing up
Carolyn's murder for political gain.

133
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,302
Hey. Raymond, let's not do this right now.

134
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,054
- Fuck you too, Tommy.
- This is beneath us.

135
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,639
- Just shut the fuck up.
- This is beneath us.

136
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,724
Nothing's beneath me.
I once fucked an ottoman.

137
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,102
The Lord is nigh unto them
that are of broken heart,

138
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,148
who are pressed
and bored down with afflictions,

139
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,819
by the sorrow of heart
under which their spirits are broken

140
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,865
or with a sense of sin and sorrow for it

141
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,244
by which their hearts smite them...

142
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,745
- Her ex.
- ...and they are wounded by it...

143
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,330
- You ever meet him?
- No.

144
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,499
- ...and broken with it.
- Fucking weirdo.

145
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,167
[priest] These are just words.

146
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,544
[Rusty] He has an alibi.

147
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,880
- Carolyn Polhemus was flesh and blood...
- Who's the kid next to him?

148
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,550
- ...beloved daughter...
- Her son.

149
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,593
...mother, public servant.

150
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,928
[Raymond] You didn't know?

151
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,183
[priest] Words cannot convey the loss

152
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,519
or ease our grief.

153
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,816
We tell ourselves
we keep her in our hearts and our minds.

154
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,735
- Sorry, Raymond, I'm just gonna--
- Yeah, yeah.

155
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,404
[priest] Ash would not be just ash.

156
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,407
Her dust will not be just dust.

157
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,159
Her memory will fill us.

158
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,584
[Rusty] It just seems strange that she
would never mention that she had a kid.

159
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,169
And the ex has custody?

160
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,254
I'm assuming he does. Yeah.

161
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:53,886
Listen, please tell me
that we have some kind of a lead on this,

162
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:57,264
and that we are not
absolutely out to fucking sea.

163
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,849
I have-- I have an idea.

164
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:00,475
- Okay.
- Bunny Davis.

165
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,770
Reynolds? We convicted that guy.

166
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,814
Yeah, but Carolyn and I
worked that case together.

167
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:09,401
So you're saying
that we put an innocent man behind bars

168
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,904
only to have the real killer
kill one of our prosecutors?

169
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:14,198
Great. That'll get me fucking reelected.

170
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:16,074
[both sigh]

171
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,411
The two of them were tied up
in exactly the same way.

172
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,748
Do you really think there's a connection?

173
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,547
You asked if we were out at sea.

174
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:44,853
- [grunts]
- [ball thuds]

175
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,981
Dad?

176
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,069
[grunts]

177
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,322
How come you're home?

178
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,074
I was at Carolyn's memorial.

179
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,118
- [grunts]
- [ball thuds]

180
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:06,834
You wanna try some?

181
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,839
Come on. Let's see the curveball. Come on.

182
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,470
Show me the curveball.

183
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:23,976
[sighs]

184
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,272
- [grunts]
- [ball thuds]

185
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,316
Again. Let's see it again.

186
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,285
[grunts]

187
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,245
[thunder rumbles]

188
00:12:32,503 --> 00:12:34,963
[Rusty] <i>Blunt force trauma to the head.
That's the official cause of death.</i>

189
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,840
[Kumagai] <i>Read the report. I sent it over.</i>

190
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,552
I did. There's no chemistry, pathology,
toxicology. Wasn't very thorough.

191
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,180
Wow. Go fuck yourself.

192
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,098
I am a medical doctor,

193
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,226
and you will give me your respect
while you're in this room.

194
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:49,394
No wounds that would imply
that she was stabbed.

195
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,647
- No, she wasn't stabbed.
- And no signs of sexual assault.

196
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,107
No, and you'd know that if you'd read
the report all the way through.

197
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,901
I swear to God, you fucking people.

198
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,194
[chuckles]

199
00:12:58,654 --> 00:12:59,780
Excuse me?

200
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,075
I said, uh, "you," and I said "fucking,"
and I said "people."

201
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,118
I need to go finish my lunch, so...

202
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:09,039
It was great seeing ya, Sabich.
Uh, enjoy the sights.

203
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:28,141
[Carolyn] Liam Reynolds
has been watching Bunny Davis.

204
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:32,980
He knows that a $12 baggie of heroin
can get him anything he wants,

205
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,940
so he tricks her into his motel room.

206
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,485
And over the course of that week,
he keeps her high.

207
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:43,115
So high that he has to give her Narcan
on three different occasions

208
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,074
to revive her.

209
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:49,997
Bunny Davis dies three times
while she's with Reynolds.

210
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:54,126
And he revives her three times.

211
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,964
She's too drugged to resist,
but not so drugged she can't feel it.

212
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,550
And when he runs out of drugs

213
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,971
and can no longer sedate her,
he hog-ties her for three days.

214
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:10,642
Three days with a rope around your neck,
pulling you, choking you.

215
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:17,232
Bunny Davis was a daughter...

216
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,277
a sister...

217
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:23,197
a friend.

218
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,117
Bunny Davis was 26 years old

219
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:30,704
when she found herself
hog-tied in a dirty motel with a monster,

220
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,539
and she is praying-- pleading--

221
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,209
that this is the kind of man
who will just let her go.

222
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,378
But no.

223
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:47,054
This man, Liam Reynolds,
is the kind of man who does this...

224
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:52,726
and this...

225
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,397
<i>and this.</i>

226
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,071
[Tommy] You remember Bunny Davis?

227
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,490
Uh, yeah.

228
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,618
Carolyn was tied up in a--
in a similar way.

229
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,954
All right.
Well, you think there's a connection?

230
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,789
[Tommy]
<i>Apparently, Rusty thinks there's one.</i>

231
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,709
Yeah, but Liam Reynolds is in prison.

232
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,962
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

233
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,673
<i>Well, you know, it's not our case.</i>

234
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,466
Not yet.

235
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:36,979
[gate buzzes]

236
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:42,776
I don't think this is our guy.

237
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,821
It's, uh-- It's totally plausible

238
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:48,031
that he could have
gotten someone on the outside to do it.

239
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,324
That's a stretch.

240
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:51,869
Different MO.
The other victim was stabbed in the heart.

241
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,829
Carolyn was bludgeoned.

242
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,248
It was a fire poker, by the way.

243
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,626
Really?

244
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,545
Yeah, she had a whole
wrought-iron fireplace set.

245
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,755
[inhales deeply] Poker's missing.

246
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,465
It would, uh, match the wounds.

247
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,010
- Really?
- [officer] You're good.

248
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,429
[Rigo] Makes me think it just happened.
It wasn't planned.

249
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:12,097
[Rusty]
It just happened? It was meticulous.

250
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,932
[Rigo] No, she was tied up meticulous.

251
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:15,934
Not so much the murder.

252
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,688
Sounds like something I'd do. [chuckles]

253
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,526
Sounds like something I'd enjoy.

254
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,447
So, am I a suspect?

255
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,035
[sniffs, scoffs]

256
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:38,165
I mean... [chuckles] ...hope so.

257
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:40,417
It's pretty fucking boring around here.

258
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,886
Will I get to go back to court,
put on a tie, dress up?

259
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,724
What, are you... [stammers]
...looking for some kind of revelation?

260
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,142
{\an8}Fuck off.

261
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,900
She was about notches on her belt,
which I was one.

262
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:11,906
So, if you want a statement from me,
I got a statement for you. "Yippee."

263
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,992
Or no, here's a-- here's a better one.

264
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:19,373
Here's a better one from me.
"What goes around comes around."

265
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,332
Are you done?

266
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,667
I'd gladly crater her skull.

267
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,087
[scoffs, sniffing]

268
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,257
You're a thoughtful guy, yeah?

269
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:30,467
Okay. So, let's just say,
for the sake of argument--

270
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:31,844
yours, not mine--

271
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:35,347
you're a thoughtful guy
serving a life sentence.

272
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,182
Not Carolyn's doing, by the way.

273
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,852
And that if you had
any information at all,

274
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,812
I think you might find it advantageous

275
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:45,315
that you're sitting across
from the chief deputy prosecutor.

276
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,233
What do you wanna do?

277
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,735
You wanna go keep doing whatever it is
that you're doing around here?

278
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,778
Let me ask you something.

279
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,114
Do you actually think

280
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:55,576
that I had something to do
with the death of your revered colleague?

281
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:59,162
I think-- I think
that you would be intrigued

282
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,456
by the commonalities
between Bunny and her.

283
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,501
And that if you had anything
to share at all,

284
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,253
now might be an opportune time.

285
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,216
Carolyn Polhemus.

286
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:14,094
Carolyn Polhemus...

287
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:19,892
ruined my life.

288
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:23,729
You helped.

289
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,734
[juror]
<i>We, the jury in the above-titled case,</i>

290
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:31,820
find the defendant, Liam Reynolds,
guilty of murder in the first degree.

291
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,156
[spectators clamoring] Yes!

292
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,950
There's two things that I never forget.

293
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:42,748
- Faces, and being fucked over!
- [spectators gasping]

294
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:48,962
[inhales deeply]

295
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,935
[Raymond] <i>As beloved as Carolyn was,</i>

296
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,354
she also made a lot of enemies.

297
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,523
She was an unflinching prosecutor

298
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,733
who put a lot of very bad people
in prison.

299
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,652
<i>Some possibly looking to get even.</i>

300
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:15,113
<i>It's every prosecutor's worst fantasy</i>

301
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:18,116
that someone you convict
comes looking for revenge.

302
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:22,829
<i>Violent criminals with grudges
is not something you want to cultivate.</i>

303
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,669
Things aren't okay the way they are.
There's a lot of fear.

304
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,379
People don't feel safe,

305
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,757
<i>and people are anxious.
And they've got good reason to be,</i>

306
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:37,636
<i>because Raymond Horgan is not doing
a good-enough job of keeping things safe,</i>

307
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,889
and that's something
that we intend to change.

308
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:44,434
<i>And right now, people don't feel free
and they don't feel safe.</i>

309
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,272
<i>So, in two weeks, Chicago,
get out there and vote.</i>

310
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:51,066
[doorbell rings]

311
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,445
Mr. Caldwell, I'm-- I'm sorry for just,
uh, turning up like this.

312
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,823
- My name is Rusty Sabich.
- I know who you are.

313
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,410
Carolyn spoke of you.

314
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,498
I tried calling.

315
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,000
Police have already been here.

316
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,837
Could I just have a word with you?

317
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,512
[sighs]

318
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:29,897
<i>We divorced over nine years ago.
We haven't really kept in close touch.</i>

319
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,524
[Rusty] And do you know anything
about her personal life?

320
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:33,734
I do not.

321
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,485
Do you?

322
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,656
Her life was work,
so the people at her work

323
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,658
would be in a much better position
to know.

324
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,493
Really, the reason we divorced.

325
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,665
You, uh--
You worked quite closely with her,

326
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,042
from what I understand.

327
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,127
She was my number two.

328
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:56,048
I never knew that she had a child.

329
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,175
[scoffs]

330
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,970
Yeah, sometimes what you don't know
can tell you everything.

331
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,057
[door opens, closes]

332
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:09,144
Carolyn was a-a very
compartmentalized person.

333
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,566
I'm sure there are many things
about her that remain unknown to me.

334
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:19,988
Whatever I did see and know
is what she wanted seen and known.

335
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,993
If you're wondering whether I killed her,

336
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,329
the police have already
satisfied themselves that I didn't.

337
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:28,413
[door closes]

338
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,004
Uh, my son, Michael.

339
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,506
Mr. Sabich.

340
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:40,384
Hello, Michael. I'm sorry for your loss.

341
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:43,679
Thank you.

342
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,188
He's angry...

343
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:58,277
at the world, at his mother, at-- at me.

344
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,198
His family unit failed.

345
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:06,243
I'm sure he blames me for that failure.

346
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,649
[breathes shakily]

347
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,163
Okay, everyone. Let's get started.

348
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,375
Um, listen,
I know that we're all struggling.

349
00:22:55,959 --> 00:23:00,839
We're going through some very,
uh, hard times.

350
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:05,219
Carolyn was a-- a really special person,
one of our core team.

351
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:07,054
Look, it's okay to hurt.

352
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:12,684
And, uh, it's okay if you can't carry on.

353
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:13,852
That's human nature.

354
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,772
But it's also human nature
to support each other.

355
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:20,108
You know, to be compassionate.

356
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,819
What's the, uh-- What's--

357
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:25,864
Sorry.

358
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,912
What's the news on that front,
Carolyn's murder?

359
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:36,750
Uh, well, we haven't gotten
the whole full path report.

360
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,126
Um...

361
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:43,382
On Carolyn's clothes and body,
there were, uh,

362
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:46,176
minute fibers of a carpeting
that were not found in her apartment.

363
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,387
They were synthetic, milled domestically.

364
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:49,972
The color is called Scottish malt.

365
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,265
The dye lot hasn't been identified

366
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,475
and the fiber could be from either
industrial or domestic weave--

367
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,018
Color's called Scottish malt.

368
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,312
Narrows it down.

369
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,484
Um, there was also probably no struggle
before she was killed,

370
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:05,279
so no sign of break-in, which suggests
that Carolyn knew her killer.

371
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,532
And the autopsy concludes
three blows to the head.

372
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:10,033
And what's this with the rope?

373
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:16,248
It's just standard half-inch,
American-made hemp.

374
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,417
Right. Which can be found almost anywhere.

375
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,044
Target, Walgreens, Home Depot.

376
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:26,175
So, when you say that this investigation
is nowhere, you really mean it.

377
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:28,010
Is that what you plan to report to Delay,

378
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,596
so you can call a press conference
and declare incompetence?

379
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:32,389
Your incompetence is on full parade today.

380
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:37,144
Wow, you-- you really can be a real dick,
can't you, Tommy?

381
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:42,858
I guess this ends
the compassionate portion of the evening.

382
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:46,195
Tommy, can I talk to you?

383
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:57,748
What the fuck was that, Tommy?

384
00:24:57,748 --> 00:24:59,541
- What?
- You think that that's productive?

385
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,959
I wasn't aware
that's what we were going for.

386
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:02,336
- You know what?
- I know a lot.

387
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:05,631
Uh-uh. You know what, I'm tired
of your fucking insubordination, okay?

388
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:08,258
And if I find that you
have been blocking my investigation, I--

389
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,344
Blocking-- [stammers]
You have carpet fibers.

390
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:12,137
The case is basically solved.

391
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:13,263
Are you fucking kidding me?

392
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:14,765
You wanna take me on?

393
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,059
You wanna take me on?

394
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,769
- No.
- You think that would be a good idea?

395
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:19,686
Hmm?

396
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,939
How do you think
that'll work out for you, Tommy?

397
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:23,941
[chuckles] You're upset.

398
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,111
Yeah.

399
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:35,994
Fuck.

400
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:41,542
Mr. Sabich,
any comments on the Polhemus case?

401
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,126
I'm not at liberty to comment right now.

402
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:44,711
This is an ongoing investigation,

403
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:47,130
- <i>but I can tell you that this office...</i>
- Way to go, Rusty. Come on.

404
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,299
<i>...is hard at work,
and Raymond Horgan is very hard at work.</i>

405
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:53,178
And the idea
that we're doing nothing is offensive.

406
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:57,182
I mean, I understand that that's an idea
that Nico Della Guardia wants to convey

407
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:59,476
because it's politically advantageous
for him to stoke fear.

408
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:02,604
{\an8}<i>But Nico Della Guardia hasn't tried an
actual case in this courtroom for years.</i>

409
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,064
- <i>He pleads everything out.</i>
- Get 'em!

410
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,900
[Rusty] <i>His methodology of choice
is to just stall and stall and stall</i>

411
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,527
{\an8}<i>until the defendant's lawyers have to quit</i>

412
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:09,945
<i>'cause their clients
can't pay them anymore.</i>

413
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,364
<i>It's one thing to be a hack.
It's another thing to be dishonorable.</i>

414
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:13,448
<i>But to be both is--</i>

415
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:17,077
{\an8}<i>Nico Della Guardia is known around here
as Nico "Delay" Guardia</i>

416
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,662
<i>because he stalls and he pleads out.</i>

417
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:20,914
{\an8}<i>And just one last thing.
Just one last thing.</i>

418
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,417
<i>If you were headed down a dark alley
and danger lay ahead...</i>

419
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,127
- [scoffs]
- <i>...who would you want in your corner?</i>

420
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:26,170
<i>A pleader and a staller...</i>

421
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,754
- That little fuck.
- <i>...like Nico Della Guardia,</i>

422
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,214
{\an8}<i>or a fighter like Raymond Horgan?</i>

423
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,555
[Barbara] <i>Please don't tell me
you're personally handling Carolyn's case.</i>

424
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:39,433
Right?

425
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:44,313
Rusty?

426
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:48,901
Raymond asked me to.

427
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:57,576
Raymond asked you to.

428
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:00,037
[sighs]

429
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:05,584
If I don't take it, then it falls
to Tommy Molto, who will do nothing

430
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:09,004
because this going unsolved
dooms Raymond's chances of reelection.

431
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:14,259
I mean, should Della Guardia win,
then he'll give Tommy my job, by the way.

432
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,556
And what if it gets out...

433
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,772
[stammers] That you two were involved.

434
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,401
I mean, what's that gonna do to your case,

435
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:35,322
your career and our kids?

436
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,035
Me?

437
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:45,541
It has been over for so long
between me and Carolyn.

438
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,838
I just need two weeks,
because between now and the primary,

439
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:53,215
Raymond needs there to be a case, Barbara.

440
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:56,218
And I am the only one
in the position to deliver that.

441
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:59,972
[inhales deeply] What, he can't find
a prosecutor who hasn't slept with her?

442
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,439
I'm sorry.

443
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:19,908
[sighs]

444
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:24,329
[sighs]

445
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,294
Our marriage barely survived this.

446
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:36,258
I barely survived this.

447
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,054
I know you, Rusty.

448
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:46,685
[sighs] You will disappear into this case.

449
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:53,942
[sighs] You will disappear
and you will go silent.

450
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,037
And that'll break me.

451
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,877
[exhales deeply]

452
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,051
My father cheated on my mother...

453
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:06,723
and, uh...

454
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:13,397
I swore to myself
that I would never do that.

455
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:24,032
[scoffs] And now I'm here.

456
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:31,164
Why do you think it happened?

457
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:39,214
I don't know.
You know, it wasn't about the sex.

458
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:43,886
I mean, it became about that.

459
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:47,556
But I mean, with Barbara, that's--
that's what it was at first.

460
00:30:47,556 --> 00:30:49,808
I mean, B and I met when we were 20.

461
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,268
She was pregnant six months later,

462
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,854
and then there was Jaden
and-- and then there was Kyle.

463
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,566
And so we were just-- we were in.

464
00:30:57,566 --> 00:31:00,777
When we laid down to bed... [stammers]
...you know, we lay with all of our worries.

465
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:04,114
You know, the kids' troubles at school,
my caseload.

466
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,367
<i>With Carolyn, it was just pure.</i>

467
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:11,163
She just woke me up, you know?

468
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:17,753
<i>She was funny and strong,
and she was brilliant, Carolyn.</i>

469
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:19,880
<i>Just fucking brilliant.</i> [chuckles]

470
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:24,551
You know what I can't make sense of,
and maybe you can help me understand?

471
00:31:27,387 --> 00:31:30,182
There was something
about that first encounter...

472
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:33,852
[sighs] <i>...I just keep thinking about.</i>

473
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:36,897
I mean, maybe what she
was drawn to wasn't just me.

474
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:40,025
Meaning?

475
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,239
Do you think she was drawn to your power?

476
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,579
Well, that doesn't sound very loving.

477
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,458
[sighs]

478
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,216
But it was.

479
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:11,473
I'm trying to teach you something.

480
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:13,100
- You're not listening.
- I'm trying to learn.

481
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,394
- You're not listening.
- I'm-- I'm half listening.

482
00:32:15,394 --> 00:32:16,311
Mm-hmm.

483
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:18,105
Kind of miss the old days,

484
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:22,025
where, if two consenting adults wanted to
touch each other, they could just touch.

485
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,081
[sighs]

486
00:32:42,671 --> 00:32:44,882
We were very physical.

487
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:47,968
She was very aggressive.

488
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:51,054
- <i>Uh, she liked it when I was aggressive.</i>
- [panting, kissing]

489
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,973
You're talking about the sex now?

["Crazy" playing]

491
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:02,274
And sometimes when Carolyn and I
would engage in ways

492
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:05,027
that B and I never did,

493
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:07,029
<i>Carolyn would look at me
and she would say,</i>

494
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:09,948
"Does Barbara do this for you?"

495
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:14,786
Almost like she wanted to bring her
into the bed with us.

496
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:18,123
Like she wanted her to be in bed with us.

497
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:22,127
Like she wanted one more witness
to what I was willing to lose.

498
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,425
Is that a sentiment
that you've shared with Barbara?

499
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:31,970
Don't.

Fuck!

506
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,259
I can't stop thinking about her.

00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:55,137
- What-- [chuckling]
- [chanting continues]

512
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:58,724
- What a wonderful night.
- [cheers]

513
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:05,606
But look, let's remember, friends,
only the beginning.

514
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:07,858
[chanting continues]

515
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:13,614
I would also like to thank

516
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:18,410
my wonderful friend and noble adversary,
Raymond Horgan.

517
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,037
{\an8}- [crowd booing]
- <i>Thank you-- No, no, no.</i>

518
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:24,875
{\an8}<i>He has served this city
so faithfully for so long.</i>

519
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,461
- <i>But wonderful and noble.</i>
- [mocking] So faithfully for so long.

520
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:29,171
<i>He's my dear friend Raymond.</i>

521
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:31,507
- My dear friend Raymond.
- <i>My heart and love go out to him.</i>

522
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:33,550
{\an8}<i>So, Raymond Horgan, thank you, please.</i>

523
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,594
{\an8}- [crowd cheers]
- <i>Yeah.</i>

524
00:35:35,594 --> 00:35:38,639
{\an8}<i>But you know, look,</i>

525
00:35:39,264 --> 00:35:41,558
<i>that's the past and we're here for the...</i>

526
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:43,310
[crowd] <i>Future!</i>

527
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,270
Does this mean you're out tonight?

528
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:49,566
I mean, I still have a job,
but I'm not chief deputy prosecutor.

529
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:51,068
That's Tommy, right?

530
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:52,861
Yes. It's Tommy Molto.

531
00:35:53,362 --> 00:35:54,655
[Nico] <i>...are you with me?</i>

532
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:56,365
- [Kyle] Fuck 'em.
- <i>Okay, yeah.</i>

533
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:57,574
- Kyle.
- Fuck them.

534
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:59,201
Honestly, I mean, look at 'em.

535
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,994
I mean, he's not wrong.

536
00:36:00,994 --> 00:36:03,288
You wouldn't wanna be there
with these guys in charge.

537
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:06,291
Okay. Well, where would I go?

538
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:08,293
- [Jaden] Mmm...
- What would I do?

539
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:11,922
What about the case?

540
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:16,009
I don't know. [sighs]

541
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:23,392
[Barbara clears throat]

542
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:33,485
How'd it go with Dr. Rush?

543
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:34,903
You would have liked it.

544
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:37,322
She completely took your side.

545
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:40,033
Of course she did. I'm the "cuckoldee."

546
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,834
I am sorry about the election...

547
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:52,504
and your job.

548
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,257
I'm almost relieved, you know?

549
00:36:57,092 --> 00:36:58,719
Thank you for sticking by me.

550
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,016
It's not lost on me that I'm, you know...

551
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:07,728
The stickiest?

552
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:14,234
You know, I'm not tragically dependent.

553
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:17,154
I could have left.

554
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:20,199
I could have moved on. I still could.

555
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:27,164
The reason I haven't is we have a family...

556
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:33,921
and if I'm desperate for anything,
it's to preserve that.

557
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,304
Oh, and I love you.

558
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:46,141
There's that. [breathes shakily]

559
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:51,688
I will fight-- You and I will fight--

560
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:56,527
to save what we have
because we have got a lot.

561
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:06,745
But you need to stop loving her.

562
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:14,378
You need to stop loving her.

563
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:46,785
[Raymond] <i>I called Nico.</i>

564
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:51,665
<i>Congratulated him on both his victory
and a race well-fought.</i>

565
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:55,252
<i>I also told him that I would be
stepping down immediately,</i>

566
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:58,922
<i>as it will allow him
to enjoy a bit of incumbency</i>

567
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,799
<i>before the general election.</i>

568
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,052
<i>Add to that, a lame-duck prosecutor</i>

569
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:06,722
<i>really can't serve
the best interests of our city.</i>

570
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:07,806
[elevator dings]

571
00:39:15,147 --> 00:39:16,440
Rigo, hey.

572
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,901
Hey, how you doing?

573
00:39:18,901 --> 00:39:20,027
[scoffs] I don't know.

574
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,945
Yeah. Well, sorry.

575
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:24,156
What are you doing here?

576
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:26,533
Hall and Oates
want a debrief on some cases.

577
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:28,911
Oh, some cases? [chuckles]

578
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,246
Hey, you gonna hang in okay?

579
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,291
- Always.
- See ya.

580
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:41,632
[grunts]

581
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,054
- [knocking]
- Yeah.

582
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:48,889
- Hey.
- Hey.

583
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,976
[exhales heavily] Wow,
couldn't get out of here fast enough, huh?

584
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:57,397
Yeah. Well, if you believe the press,
I don't really have that much time here.

585
00:39:57,397 --> 00:40:00,067
It's like a champion stud
going out to pasture.

586
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:03,111
If only the stud part
still worked. [chuckles]

587
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:05,322
[chuckles] You ready?

588
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:06,698
What, for pasture?

589
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:07,783
No, for this meeting.

590
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:10,494
Oh, with Tweedledum and Tweedledumber.

591
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:11,578
[chuckling]

592
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:13,497
Mmm. [groans]

593
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:16,750
Okay.

594
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:20,128
You've seen the look on my face. Happy?

595
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:23,173
[laughs] Please.
Come on, Raymond. Take a seat.

596
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:25,717
You too, Rusty. And close the door.

597
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,601
First off, I just wanna thank you
for your gracious remarks last night.

598
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:36,979
They were very moving, very kind.

599
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:38,355
Oh, fuck off.

600
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:39,690
[chuckles]

601
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,280
Your previous public comments, however,
saddened me.

602
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,616
Sorry you feel that way.

603
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:56,039
So, Tommy's gonna assume the role
of chief deputy prosecutor,

604
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,541
effective immediately.

605
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:00,294
Uh, it goes without saying, you'll just
pass on your case list

606
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:03,213
and charging notes and calendar files,
and blah-blah-blah.

607
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:08,010
And then given the compounding public
interest in the Carolyn Polhemus case--

608
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,763
The fire you flamed like a shameless fuck?

609
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:16,935
Where are we on that?

610
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:19,938
I mean, I gave Tommy the full report.

611
00:41:19,938 --> 00:41:21,690
Actually, I don't think you did.

612
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,567
There's a-- a couple things
are missing here.

613
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:24,526
[Rusty] Like what?

614
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:26,695
Um, the fingerprint analysis,
for starters.

615
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:27,988
I'm still waiting on that.

616
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:31,909
It's available.

617
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:35,287
[clears throat]

618
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:37,247
So you have been tampering?

619
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:41,168
Well, I mean,
it's my investigation now. [chuckles]

620
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:48,383
Several sets of fingerprints were found
in her apartment, including yours.

621
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:51,261
So, when was the last time
you were in Carolyn's apartment?

622
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:53,597
I was at the scene following her death.

623
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:57,059
But you were gloved up... [stammers] ...right?

624
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:59,186
And your fingerprints
were found in her bedroom.

625
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:00,604
No one saw you enter that room.

626
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:02,773
So, when was the last time
you were in Carolyn's apartment

627
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:03,941
prior to the murder?

628
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:08,237
Uh, we had cases together-- trials--
and sometimes we would work after hours,

629
00:42:08,237 --> 00:42:10,280
and sometimes
we would be at her apartment.

630
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,157
So you discussed cases at her apartment?

631
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:15,452
We were work colleagues.

632
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:24,670
So, I looked at Carolyn's call logs
on her cell phone.

633
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:28,799
- You two had quite a few calls together.
- What is-- What is the point of this?

634
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:30,259
The point is, I'm trying to find out

635
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,553
when the last time you were in
Carolyn's apartment prior to the murder.

636
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:35,013
And you said, uh,
that you worked on cases together there.

637
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:37,516
Do I need a lawyer present
at this meeting? [chuckles]

638
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:43,522
What was the last case
the two of you worked on together?

639
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:45,524
I'm sorry,
am I under criminal investigation here?

640
00:42:45,524 --> 00:42:47,776
Listen, I'm the new
chief deputy prosecutor.

641
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:50,529
I'm looking to be briefed
by the former chief deputy.

642
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:52,155
I have questions.

643
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:53,490
It's normal.

644
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,658
Um...

645
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:02,249
Were you and Carolyn
romantically involved?

646
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:09,548
You want me to repeat the question?

647
00:43:09,548 --> 00:43:10,924
[breathes shakily]

648
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:17,681
Um, my personal, uh,
relationship with Carolyn Polhemus

649
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,101
is not relevant to this investigation.

650
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,228
Are you shitting me?

651
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:32,196
- You're a hack, Tommy.
- Hey, Rusty.

652
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:36,200
I certainly stand corrected for having
accused you of incompetence

653
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,159
in this investigation.

654
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:38,702
Seems it was deliberate,
bordering on artful.

655
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,204
- You're a fucking hack, Tommy.
- Hey, maybe--

656
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:41,163
You're a fucking hack.

657
00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:44,082
Rusty,
maybe you should keep your mouth shut.

658
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,460
[Tommy] Here's the thing. [sighs]

659
00:43:47,878 --> 00:43:51,673
Full path report came back
on Carolyn's murder and she was pregnant.

660
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:57,679
Were you aware that Carolyn was pregnant
at the time of the murder?

661
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:04,436
No.

662
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:06,605
[Tommy] Do you have any idea
who the father might be?
