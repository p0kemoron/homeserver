1
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,847
Yeah?

2
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,062
Kyle, can we talk to you for a second?

3
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,440
Your mother's here with me too.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,608
Hi, honey.

5
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,707
Kyle, there's a picture of your bike

6
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,253
at Carolyn's house
on the night of May 18th.

7
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,004
Why were you there?

8
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,008
I have no idea what you're talking about.

9
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,097
Honey...

10
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,935
I wasn't. I must've just been riding by.
That's all I--

11
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,646
- Baby.
- Okay. Kyle, there was a photograph of--

12
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,983
of you at Carolyn Polhemus's house
the night of May 18th.

13
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,234
Why were you there?

14
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,780
Honey, we got these images
from the police,

15
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,158
so they have this evidence too.

16
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,911
You gotta be honest. It's important now.

17
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,916
Oh, my God. For God's sake, Kyle,
why were you there?

18
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,338
I guess I wanted to
get a sense of the there.

19
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,926
The what?

20
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,845
Where you were going.

21
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,222
So, you knew about
your father and Carolyn?

22
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,099
I heard you two fighting about it.

23
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,268
Okay.

24
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,854
Does your sister know? Does Jaden--
Does she know?

25
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,107
I didn't tell her. I don't know.

26
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,193
When did you first find out about it?

27
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:50,360
Does that matter?

28
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,945
Well, I wouldn't ask you
if it didn't matter.

29
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,948
I don't remember.

30
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,075
A few months ago maybe.

31
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:02,539
Okay, so that I'm clear, you went there
to see what she looked like.

32
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,335
You know how to use Google,
so you could find a picture of her,

33
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,588
but you wanted to see where she lived.

34
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,925
- Were you casing out her house?
- Rusty.

35
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,093
Were you casing out her house, Kyle?

36
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:19,556
I just don't understand the reasoning
behind why you were going there.

37
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,767
Maybe I was trying to
figure out your reason.

38
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,567
- I wanna talk to Mom about this.
- No! I am your father...

39
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,236
- Rusty.
- ...and you're gonna answer--

40
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:33,695
Rusty, please.

41
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,405
It's okay.

42
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,491
Fine.

43
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,895
Bunny Davis was a daughter.

44
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:13,944
Bunny Davis was a sister,
a friend, cousin.

45
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,240
Bunny Davis was 26 years old

46
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:23,662
when she found herself alone
in a dirty motel room with a monster,

47
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,832
and she's praying-- pleading--

48
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:30,002
that this is the kind of man
who will just let her go.

49
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,422
But no.

50
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:37,968
This man, Liam Reynolds,

51
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,472
is the kind of person who does this...

52
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,352
and this...

53
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,315
and this.

54
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,701
What do you think?

55
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,330
I think you're amazing, Carolyn.

56
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,609
This thing's a fucking mess.

57
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,031
Hey.

58
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,785
Hey. The front porch light is out.

59
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,997
So, he rode by her house a few times,

60
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,959
and he saw you going in once.

61
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,091
Obviously, we need to get him
into therapy as soon as possible.

62
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,175
Why?

63
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,386
Rusty, he's been carrying this around
for months.

64
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,972
We have no idea of the impact.

65
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,933
Okay, sure, but you and I can talk to him
about this together.

66
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:08,851
Oh, right.

67
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,061
- Like you just talked to him right now?
- We don't have to have--

68
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,521
What is that supposed to mean?

69
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,064
You interrogated the kid.

70
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,482
I interrogated him?

71
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,733
Yeah.

72
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,986
I was asking him questions.

73
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,698
- "Why were you casing out her house?"
- He was there, of course I was asking.

74
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,616
Asking like a prosecutor, Rusty.

75
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,660
- Are you kidding me?
- He's 15!

76
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,497
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What?

77
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,294
- You caused this, Rusty. You did.
- Of course. It's me.

78
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,088
Yes, I am the fuck-up-in-chief.

79
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:41,258
But guess what.
You played a part in it too.

80
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:45,804
And you will, at some point,
need to take some fucking responsibility.

81
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,015
I can't do this anymore. I'm done.

82
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,225
- I just--
- Done!

83
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:06,950
In my medical opinion,

84
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,328
the cause of death
was cranial blunt force trauma.

85
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,081
So, the judge has been already told
that you're an expert,

86
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,208
so you don't need to qualify.

87
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,667
You don't need to say, "In my opinion."

88
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,127
- You can sit up straight.
- Okay.

89
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,879
- Just sit up straight.
- You don't gotta--

90
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,507
- Don't tell me how to s--
- You're gonna give the jury

91
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:24,676
- your findings, right? Your expertise.
- Don't-- Just-- Okay, I--

92
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,012
- Wow.
- And you're not gonna make it about you.

93
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,348
What an-- No. Don't do that.

94
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,141
You know,
I'm doing this bullshit exercise for you,

95
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,268
- that you got me up in the morning for...
- Which I appreciate.

96
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,938
I am a medical doctor.
You're gonna respect me.

97
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,315
I respect you as a doctor.

98
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,777
As a witness, however,
you are known to shit the bed.

99
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,904
You fucking prick.

100
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,155
Forget it.

101
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,824
This is what you got me up out of bed for?

102
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,497
I'll get that file to you
by the way, scumbag.

103
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,795
<i>The details of this case
are being kept close to the vest.</i>

104
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,380
<i>There's not been a single leak.</i>

105
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,549
<i>I mean,
how strong can this case be?</i>

106
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:04,633
<i>They don't even have a murder weapon.</i>

107
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,802
<i>Yeah, I don't see
how they've cleared the bar</i>

108
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:08,136
<i>of going beyond a shadow of a doubt.</i>

109
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,347
<i>Hard to believe
this is even going to trial.</i>

110
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,392
<i>You know, former colleagues
now at each other's throats...</i>

111
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,227
<i>Sabich has two children...</i>

112
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:16,812
- <i>But Kyle was there.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

113
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,064
<i>He just-- He rode by, like I said.</i>

114
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,316
It was just a few times.

115
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,653
- We're sure he didn't kill her?
- You know, you're not funny.

116
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,113
That's not fucking funny.

117
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,865
I wasn't intending to be.

118
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:33,495
So, Michael Caldwell at Carolyn's house
the night of the murder.

119
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,331
Footage of Kyle there, a few weeks prior?

120
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,541
Jesus Christ.

121
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,169
I'm gonna have to think about this.

122
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,004
I do not have it.

123
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,924
- Fucking--
- Is there something else?

124
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,677
I just didn't get any sleep last night,
okay, Ray?

125
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:50,846
Is that it?

126
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,516
What is it?

127
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:59,438
Barbara and I got into it,
you know, and she said that she was done.

128
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:02,649
"Done" as in, "I'm gonna leave you"?

129
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,321
Come on. If she was gonna leave you,
she would've already done it.

130
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,531
- I don't need this right now.
- What would she be waiting for?

131
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,158
Good excuse?

132
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,580
You betrayed her.

133
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,790
You betrayed your children.

134
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,043
In fact, knowing Barbara,

135
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:24,421
the betrayal of the children
is the deeper of the two offenses.

136
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,841
Ray, it's just-- it's complicated.

137
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,927
- Yeah. Tell me. Come on.
- It's-- It--

138
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,971
Depression, compulsion, narcissism.

139
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,222
I'll take any of that.

140
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,933
Let's send you to a doctor
and get a fucking diagnosis.

141
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,520
But my fear is
that it'll just come back "pig."

142
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,234
Your dick got hard for Carolyn,
you fucked her,

143
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,027
and now you wanna feel less bad about it.

144
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,197
It's what men who cheat do, Rusty.

145
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,618
They wanna have their cake, eat it,
and then chalk it up to complexity.

146
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,704
Jury will find it pretty simple.

147
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,124
On the plus side,
they'll also find it unoriginal.

148
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,294
It won't shock their conscience.

149
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,298
But for what it's worth, it shocked me.

150
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,010
It shocked Lorraine,
and I'm sure it shocked Barbara.

151
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:15,764
But she's still with you.

152
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,892
That tells me she means to hang in.

153
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,772
You know what? Hold on a second.

154
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,774
You know what? I--

155
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,068
How dare you say
that I don't take responsibility,

156
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:33,699
that I don't feel shame,
and that I am not consumed with guilt?

157
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:36,702
Fuck you.

158
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:45,961
You know, in 40 years, I have seen
a lot of guilt and shame in this business.

159
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,630
Shame is something
that you put on yourself.

160
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,049
It's self-absorbed, self-centered.

161
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:55,971
Guilt is more about owning and feeling
the pain that you cause others.

162
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,682
I don't doubt that you feel shame.

163
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,199
Tommy--

164
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,702
Tommy, why am I on the witness list?

165
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,995
'Cause I think you have information

166
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,372
about the relationship
between Carolyn and Rusty.

167
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,502
I have no information
about what happened that night.

168
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:31,173
But you might have a little information
about what happened all the other nights.

169
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:33,467
Right?

170
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:39,139
Seems to me that this is something
that really should've been reported to HR,

171
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,559
so maybe you're just wrestling
with your own culpability here.

172
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,687
Wow, you are really a miserable prick,
aren't you?

173
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:46,897
Hey, listen to me.

174
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:51,151
We're doing it for Carolyn, all right?
Just think about it. For her.

175
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:56,990
Hello, gentlemen.

176
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,326
Thanks for coming in.

177
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,703
How you doing? Get you anything?

178
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,288
You good?

179
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,792
I'm not really comfortable with all this.

180
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,377
I completely understand. It's awful.

181
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,421
But as we're building this case
against Mr. Sabich,

182
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,549
every detail becomes enormously important,

183
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:15,801
and the defense is gonna come at you
with all these questions.

184
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:18,095
And I just wanna make sure
that we have everything exactly right.

185
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,597
Shouldn't we have a lawyer with us?

186
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,100
That's entirely up to you,

187
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,978
but I'm just confirming information
that we already discussed.

188
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,482
This is a photo you took of Mr. Sabich

189
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,359
entering your mother's house
the night she was killed.

190
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,279
It's June 16th, 9:49 p.m. Is that correct?

191
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,363
Yes.

192
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,323
And all these other photos
you took on the same night?

193
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,241
Yes.

194
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:43,078
Why didn't you take pictures
of him leaving the house?

195
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,413
I left after he went in.

196
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:47,124
Why were you there?

197
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,877
Sometimes I would just go.

198
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:53,505
Why?

199
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:55,424
He already answered that.

200
00:11:55,424 --> 00:12:00,512
Okay. It's-- We-- This is
extremely important for us to iron out,

201
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,390
because they're gonna ask
the same questions, okay? The defense.

202
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,684
Because she was my mother.

203
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,103
Sometimes I'd go look at the house.

204
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,064
You ever see anyone else
entering the house?

205
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,358
He was the only one there that night.

206
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:18,113
How did Mr. Sabich seem
as he entered the house?

207
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,573
What was his demeanor?

208
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,451
I don't know.

209
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:26,788
And during this meeting
that you had with him, how did he seem?

210
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:31,376
You said that during this meeting,
you accused him of killing your mother.

211
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,461
Is that right?

212
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,672
I mean, he denied it, but he was lying.

213
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,425
Why do you say that? How do you know that?

214
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,969
I could see it in his eyes.

215
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,309
Also, once, she told me
she was becoming afraid of him.

216
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,854
But I thought you didn't-- When did you
have contact with your mother?

217
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:55,067
I had convinced her to meet me for lunch.

218
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,903
She seemed stressed,

219
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,739
and I got pissed off
because I thought it was me.

220
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,658
And then I asked her what was wrong,

221
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:08,455
and she said that there's a man at work
that's beginning to scare her.

222
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,584
- Did she say who this man was?
- Nah.

223
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,672
She said that she had cases with him,

224
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,758
which is why she couldn't shake him.

225
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,315
- Hey.
- Hi.

226
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,067
What can I get you?

227
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,447
I think--

228
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,868
Belvedere martini. No olives, no juice.

229
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,080
- Hi.
- Hi.

230
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,043
I've been talking about you all week.

231
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,006
Nah, that's not how it sounds like.

232
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,591
Okay.

233
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,092
Shift drink, Clif?

234
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,428
I wasn't, but I will now.

235
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:09,016
I got these bartender hands.

236
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,976
It's messed up all the time.

237
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:14,605
How's the drama?

238
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,483
- Same old.
- Yeah? I bet. Mind if I join you?

239
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,653
- Sure, yeah.
- Yeah?

240
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:24,656
Clifton.

241
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,910
- Barbara.
- Barbara.

242
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,620
Nice to officially meet you.

243
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,665
What is that stuff, that cream?

244
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,293
Yes. This stuff. Jeanine makes it.

245
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,671
Yeah, it's cocoa butter infused with weed.

246
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,381
Don't put your fingers in your mouth.

247
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,758
- You will get very high.
- Okay.

248
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:46,178
- Thank you for the heads-up.
- Of course. Indeed.

249
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,348
That is so generous. Thank you.

250
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:52,935
So tell me about your tattoos.

251
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:57,064
I ask, realizing it's very cliché
to ask about someone's tattoos.

252
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,815
Yeah. I get it.

253
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:02,486
This. I'm somewhat of an artist too.

254
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,199
Mainly projection art, but I designed
this during my youthful idiocy.

255
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,742
It's the <i>Yijing</i>.

256
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:10,911
You know about that?

257
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,164
I know about John Cage,

258
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:18,752
Brian Eno, and the random
creative operation of things.

259
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:19,920
Right.

260
00:15:22,631 --> 00:15:25,717
I'm also very familiar
with youthful idiocy.

261
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:30,848
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

262
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:40,858
Rigo.

263
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,025
<i>Guess what I got.</i>

264
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,696
A hit on the second sample
in the Bunny Davis case.

265
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:48,031
What? How did you do that?

266
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,200
I didn't find any matches
in the whole system.

267
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,495
Yeah. This fool gave his DNA
to Ancestry.com.

268
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:54,621
Brian Ratzer.

269
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:58,375
Ratzer. Address?

270
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,966
Do we know anything about him?

271
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:10,179
Not really, other than he left
a sperm sample at a homicide scene

272
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,638
involving a dead prostitute.

273
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,559
Look, thank you for doing this.

274
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,394
I know you're putting your ass
out on the line.

275
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,189
I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for Carolyn.

276
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,482
Rusty, I'm gonna need you to chill
in there, okay?

277
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,026
Do not say anything.

278
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:36,955
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hi.

279
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,249
Sorry to disturb you. We're with CPD.

280
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:42,002
We're looking for Brian Ratzer.
Is he home?

281
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,171
Hon!

282
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,007
He's down the basement.

283
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,927
Would you like to come inside
and I'll go get him?

284
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,011
Sure.

285
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,347
Hon.

286
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,605
Hon?

287
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:04,148
- Yeah.
- The police are here.

288
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,069
Please, have a seat. He'll be right up.

289
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,945
- Great. Thanks.
- Coffee?

290
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,030
Sure.

291
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,715
Hey.

292
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,343
- Hi.
- What can I do for you?

293
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,888
We're looking into some incidents
that happened in this area,

294
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,849
June 16th, 2019.

295
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,643
The night of. We're just canvassing.

296
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,271
What incident are you looking into?

297
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:43,856
Some break-ins.

298
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:47,234
Not on this street.
A few miles east, on Robertson.

299
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,778
It was a Thursday night.
I know it's a while to think back, but--

300
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:53,448
I don't need to think back.
I don't know the street.

301
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:57,411
If it happened at night, I work nights.

302
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,122
Where do you work?

303
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,458
Hey, can I see your badge?

304
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,543
Sure.

305
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:07,713
It's just that

306
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:10,591
- a sex worker was found murdered, so...
- Here we go.

307
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,177
Yeah. Not now, babe, okay?

308
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,387
I said not now.

309
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,347
Okay.

310
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,897
What is this about exactly?

311
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:26,690
I just told you.

312
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:28,650
Where do you work, Mr. Ratzer?

313
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,569
Did you answer the question?

314
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:31,904
I don't need to answer any questions.

315
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:34,448
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to answer the questions.

316
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,493
I mean, you're gonna have to have
the conversation at some point.

317
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,541
Don't I know you from someplace?

318
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,714
Here's my card.

319
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,342
You give me a call
when you're ready to talk.

320
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,093
And if I don't?

321
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,720
I think you're gonna have to.

322
00:18:57,763 --> 00:18:59,223
And I think you know why.

323
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,726
Or maybe we should ask your wife.

324
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,521
- Hey, Laura.
- Hey.

325
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:06,813
Yeah?

326
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,565
- It's okay, babe.
- Yeah?

327
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:14,112
What's going on? Do you need something?

328
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,324
Just wanted to say thank you
for the coffee.

329
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,953
You're welcome. Is everything okay?

330
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:22,204
Yeah.

331
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,290
Okay.

332
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,842
Get the fuck out of here.

333
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,971
I told you not to agitate him.

334
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:41,014
I just asked him one question.

335
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,434
You are un-fucking-believable.

336
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,243
Why do you look so scared?

337
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:11,837
<i>Why do you look so scared?</i>

338
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:23,432
B?

339
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,132
B, what are you doing?

340
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,510
Not taking any chances.

341
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,595
He was riding by her house.

342
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,307
Who's to say he didn't
walk through her garden,

343
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:09,520
look through her window,
stand on her doormat...

344
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,730
- Hey. Hey.
- ...ring her doorbell?

345
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,524
Come on.

346
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,860
I don't think that Kyle is a suspect.

347
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,239
Rusty.

348
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:31,708
Sometimes I think you forget
our son is Black.

349
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:52,813
How did it make you feel
to see your dad go in her house?

350
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,233
You wanna talk about it?

351
00:21:58,402 --> 00:21:59,403
No.

352
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:04,324
- You must have feelings.
- But I don't wanna talk about them.

353
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:08,704
Kyle.

354
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,962
A lot worse shit has happened
since I saw him go in her house.

355
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,219
You kidding?

356
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,768
This is ridiculous.

357
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:37,149
I made zero progress,
not that we often do right off.

358
00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:39,860
Early sessions can be more
about establishing trust,

359
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,280
and I think I failed there too.

360
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:46,325
Look, speaking to the--

361
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:51,914
the bigger issue,
I think we need to redraw some lines.

362
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,625
Okay. What do you mean?

363
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:58,253
This thing has become
way too layered and loaded

364
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:03,800
for me to treat you, Rusty, Rusty and you,
and now Kyle in the midst of--

365
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,386
It really should be one therapist per.

366
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:09,139
Per? Like we have that kind of money.

367
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,683
I think I should take you, and only you.

368
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:14,603
I know.

369
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:17,564
Can you s--

370
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:25,030
I think it's possible
that you do wanna forgive Rusty

371
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,615
and stay married to him.

372
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,575
I also think it's possible--

373
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:32,329
I suspect even more likely--
that your limbic system is just--

374
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:35,040
it's going full-bore.

375
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,961
You are in self-defense mode, trying
to save your marriage for your kids,

376
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:43,799
doing whatever you consciously
or unconsciously deem necessary.

377
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,760
You have always been
about preservation of family.

378
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:51,849
But I also think it's possible that when
the kids are grown or off to college,

379
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:55,978
this compulsion to forgive

380
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:58,897
could metastasize into something else,

381
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:04,236
like anger or hatred even.

382
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,322
Could be it's already happening.

383
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:15,205
Look, your husband fell in love
with another woman.

384
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:17,833
He's now facing trial for killing her.

385
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:20,878
You need your own therapist.

386
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:32,306
<i>So, Eugenia came by my office earlier.</i>

387
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:34,433
<i>What did she say? Why? What did she say?</i>

388
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:35,350
Hey, hey.

389
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,769
I got no issue with you calling her
as a witness, all right?

390
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:40,189
It's just--
If she's gonna be your witness,

391
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:41,940
it might help for her to be in your camp.

392
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,025
Tell me what she said.

393
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:45,444
She said that--

394
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,654
She said that you're an asshole,
all right?

395
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,323
But we know you can be a little...

396
00:24:49,323 --> 00:24:52,784
Okay. Listen, I'm my best
prosecutorial-self when I'm angry.

397
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:53,702
You know that.

398
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:58,081
Yeah, but if your plan is to rely on
hostile witnesses to make your case--

399
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:01,502
Eugenia will bend over
any which way she can to help Rusty.

400
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:05,088
I think she's a little in love with him.

401
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,299
I need to tell her to toe the line.

402
00:25:07,883 --> 00:25:11,970
No. The line you need to toe
is one of hard evidence, all right?

403
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,139
Character assassination
is not gonna get it done.

404
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:16,308
I'll give you hard evidence. Don't worry.

405
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,853
I am worried. I'm worried.

406
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:22,439
Raymond's asked for a meeting.

407
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:24,650
Why? What about?

408
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,862
Well, I can only imagine it's because
he thinks he's got a play on a plea.

409
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:32,407
And if he thinks that, he must feel
that he's got us by the balls.

410
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,952
He hasn't got my balls, Tommy.

411
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,120
Has he got yours?

412
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:40,874
There's no chance of any plea.

413
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:48,340
No. Plus, we need to find out
if there are other sex workers in the area

414
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,300
and if they can recognize Ratzer.

415
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,803
I mean, the guy fucking knows something.
I'm sure of it.

416
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,388
- <i>Of course.</i>
- You ready?

417
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:56,640
- Yeah. Look, I'll call you back.
- <i>Sure.</i>

418
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:01,812
Can you take me through that night again?

419
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:04,398
You said you were
at the office that night.

420
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:08,652
Yes.

421
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:10,863
A few of us were working late
on Raymond's campaign,

422
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:13,991
ostensibly working on Raymond's campaign.

423
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:16,994
Ostensibly?

424
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:19,663
Well, I was mostly texting.

425
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:26,336
And getting no messages back...

426
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:30,549
which I wasn't really handling very well.

427
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:36,805
<i>And she was basically ghosting me,
so I needed somewhere to go.</i>

428
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,979
And what time did you leave the office?

429
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,647
A little after 8:30.

430
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:49,193
So I'd sometimes eat out because I just--

431
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,571
I wasn't in any state to go home.

432
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:06,251
I don't really remember much from the bar.

433
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:14,927
Guess I had a few things to drink.

434
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:18,096
Maybe I ordered another. I don't know.

435
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:28,232
<i>And then she texted back,</i>

436
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,276
{\an8}<i>and I was off to the races.</i>

437
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:37,699
So the text from her comes in at 9:24 p.m.

438
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:42,788
Michael Caldwell's photos
show you arriving at 9:49.

439
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:46,583
What happened?

440
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:53,173
I mean, I don't know how much detail
you want here, but...

441
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:57,803
Hey.

442
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,932
What happened...

443
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:05,561
- What?
- I just--

444
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:07,938
What happened?

445
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:09,481
I don't know why you're so angry.

446
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:11,984
What happened?

447
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,154
Miss you so much.

448
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:24,788
Well, mostly, we argued.

449
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:26,957
You argued?

450
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:29,334
I wanted to get back together,
and she didn't,

451
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,420
- and, I mean, that was pretty much it.
- <i>Stop.</i>

452
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,380
- Hey.
- Leave!

453
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:43,015
Cell metadata has you arriving home
at 11:00 on the nose.

454
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:50,439
It's a 20-minute drive from her house
to yours, which means you left at 10:40.

455
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,318
You were at her house for 51 minutes.

456
00:28:56,695 --> 00:28:57,821
Long argument.

457
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,079
Get the fuck out of here.

458
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:11,919
And then you just left after that?

459
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:16,089
Then we kissed goodbye.

460
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:18,759
You kissed?

461
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,012
Yes, and then I went home.

462
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:29,353
<i>When she kissed me,
she knew that it would give me hope.</i>

463
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,905
<i>I mean, the kiss got me to the car.</i>

464
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,657
<i>It got me to go home.</i>

465
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:45,744
But when I got home, I realized that--

466
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:48,580
that hope had just turned into cruelty.

467
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,292
She knew what she was doing.

468
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:56,880
She was fucking cruel.

469
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:08,892
So, what's your take so far?

470
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:12,980
Well, on the case,
I kind of like where we're at.

471
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,607
They'll have a hard time
making their burden.

472
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:18,527
At the same time, 51 minutes.

473
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:21,196
They'll argue it's long enough
to have tied her, cleaned the scene.

474
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:24,867
Or had sex, or argued,
or had a fight and made up.

475
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:27,411
What about Rusty?

476
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:29,663
Thoughts about putting him on the stand?

477
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:33,166
There is no way we let that man
anywhere near the witness chair.

478
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:37,212
Agreed.

479
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,257
What'd we find out about Ratzer?

480
00:30:40,257 --> 00:30:41,633
There's gotta be something there.

481
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,051
He got an alibi?

482
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,595
Right, no prior arrests?

483
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:47,764
<i>We use CPD in Illinois State?</i>

484
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:50,976
<i>We got nothing. All right.
Well, he was with Reynolds, right?</i>

485
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:53,312
<i>Well, he was there with Reynolds,
with Bunny Davis.</i>

486
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:55,564
We just have to fucking prove it.

487
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:57,441
Yeah, just keep-- just keep at it.

488
00:30:57,441 --> 00:30:58,567
Just keep pushing.

489
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:01,069
Fuck.

490
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,411
Hey, Molto.

491
00:31:22,341 --> 00:31:23,842
Okay. Thank you.

492
00:31:58,794 --> 00:31:59,962
<i>Yeah?</i>

493
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:01,046
<i>Hey...</i>

494
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:08,220
I know that we said a lot
to each other the other night. And...

495
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:14,184
I just want you to know
that I heard-- I heard you.

496
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:19,606
Rusty, can we talk about this
when I get home?

497
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:22,943
I'm just about to step into the market.

498
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,823
- Yeah, of course. Yeah.
- <i>Okay?</i>

499
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:32,077
I love you.

500
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:36,248
Love you.

501
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,841
<i>You know, I'm really starting
to understand the allure of day drinking.</i>

502
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:47,009
<i>You ever night drink?</i>

503
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:49,469
I have appearances to uphold.

504
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,221
Like what?

505
00:32:52,097 --> 00:32:54,600
Mom. Wife.

506
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,269
All the shit you probably
don't wanna hear about.

507
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:59,021
Oh, on the contrary.

508
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:02,399
Yeah, I'm deeply curious
on what it's like to be you right now.

509
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,193
Honestly...

510
00:33:06,195 --> 00:33:07,279
I don't know.

511
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:19,082
Well, if you ever want to talk
and should I not be here...

512
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:27,049
Thank you.

513
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,061
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey, Raymond.

514
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:22,312
- Helen.
- Hey.

515
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:25,190
Eugenia.

516
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,862
Oh, my God.
Hi. Raymond. Oh, my God. How are you?

517
00:34:29,862 --> 00:34:31,196
I'm hanging in. You?

518
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:33,447
I'm on the witness list.

519
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:35,284
- I saw that.
- Yeah.

520
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:38,036
I knew about the two of 'em.

521
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,496
Well, I wouldn't lose any sleep.

522
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:42,040
We're not denying the relationship.

523
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,375
Okay.

524
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,918
Well, do me a favor, will you?

525
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,965
Tell Rusty I have no intent
of giving testimony against him, okay?

526
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:52,134
- I'll do that.
- Thank you.

527
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:58,140
- Hi, guys.
- Raymond.

528
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,058
It's good to see you, as always.

529
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:02,769
Yes.

530
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:05,647
Okay, let's get right to it.

531
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:09,943
You two have a really fucking lousy case,
and I think you both know it.

532
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:12,446
I mean,
it's not a complete nothing burger.

533
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:14,156
He was there, last seen with her.

534
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:16,325
That's something,
but it's shitty all the same.

535
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:17,242
We disagree.

536
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:21,622
Not a drop of her blood found
in Rusty's car, none of her DNA at all.

537
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,957
Blood and guts everywhere at her home,

538
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:26,793
not so much as a microscopic drop
in his car.

539
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:28,712
- He cleaned it.
- Or on his clothing.

540
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:30,297
- Cleaned it also.
- No murder weapon.

541
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:31,215
Disposed of it.

542
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:33,300
You're not gonna be able
to settle on a theory, you know?

543
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:37,262
Being tied up like that,
that speaks to premeditation.

544
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:40,599
Death by fire poker? Heat of passion.

545
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:43,185
Right from the get-go,
your case is a fucking mess.

546
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,520
Well, we love a challenge.

547
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,188
I know that there is a reason

548
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:48,857
you brought
the lesser charge of obstruction,

549
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:50,317
and I would've done the same thing,

550
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:53,737
so you could get him on something.
'Cause walking away with nothing--

551
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:55,197
What is your point?

552
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:58,867
I can see that someone's
been directed not to speak.

553
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:03,956
- Smart.
- All right, great. Please, just--

554
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:08,126
Rusty cannot risk spending
the rest of his natural life in prison,

555
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:10,212
and you cannot chance an acquittal

556
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:13,674
and the obliteration
of all of your political capital.

557
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:16,343
We'll cop to the obstruction, three years.

558
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,059
Ray, you seriously think we'll
plead it out on an obstruction charge?

559
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:25,894
Nico, you know you moved too fast.

560
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:28,397
Tommy, he was dying for a suspect.

561
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:31,316
The idea that it could
possibly have been Rusty, well...

562
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:33,151
Is that right? Fuck you.

563
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:36,697
Let's talk about your bigger problem
sitting right here.

564
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:39,950
You've got a shitty, circumstantial case,

565
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:44,872
first-chaired by a fucking
nickel-and-dimer, going against me.

566
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:46,540
You're not stupid, Nico.

567
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,417
I'm giving you a conviction.

568
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,711
And with Judge Lyttle,

569
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:54,631
I've got a very good shot
at a required finding of not guilty.

570
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:57,134
That is a political death knell.

571
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:00,137
I'm offering you an escape hatch.

572
00:37:04,975 --> 00:37:07,436
- What's this?
- Just have a read. Just check it out.

573
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:20,657
Why am I just seeing this now?

574
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:23,702
We just got it ourselves.

575
00:37:41,303 --> 00:37:43,764
That wasn't the kind of sex we have.

576
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,600
Well, not for a long time, anyway.

577
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,189
Was it the kind of sex you had with her?

578
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:57,486
No.

579
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:01,865
She isn't you.

580
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:05,077
She wasn't.

581
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,500
I think what I find hard to understand is...

582
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,380
did you ask yourself...

583
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:20,551
what you were willing to lose?

584
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:29,643
We were so far apart, you and me.

585
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:33,230
I feel like, at the time,
we couldn't even have a conversation.

586
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:37,693
But she woke something up inside me,
you know?

587
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:38,777
Something...

588
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:41,822
that I thought was dead.

589
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:49,621
When you said I needed
to take responsibility--

590
00:38:49,621 --> 00:38:51,790
B, I don't think I meant it the way you--

591
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,418
I don't think you were wrong, Rusty.

592
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:57,671
I think we allowed ourselves...

593
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:02,843
to drift apart.

594
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:10,517
Even the sex we just had now, it felt like
we were trying to prove something.

595
00:39:10,517 --> 00:39:15,606
That what we had is still there.

596
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:19,985
Is it?

597
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:28,577
Fucking Raymond.

598
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:31,705
I'm gonna take it.

599
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:36,376
Hey.

600
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:39,463
- <i>Rusty.</i>
- Yeah.

601
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:43,300
Our case just took a turn.

602
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:49,348
Your skin was found
under Carolyn's fingernails.

603
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,017
What? That's-- Wait. That's impossible.

604
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,394
It's in the report.
I just learned about it.

605
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:57,606
No. It's-- I--
Ray, she never scratched me.

606
00:39:57,606 --> 00:39:59,900
Like-- It's a fucking lie.

607
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,860
DNA is DNA, Rusty.

608
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,321
No, it's a lie. I-- Oh, my God.

609
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:07,741
I can't believe
that they're going ahead and doing this.

610
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:09,034
Who?

611
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:12,496
Fucking Molto and Delay,
and Kumagai, all of them.

612
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:13,789
- Oh, come on.
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

613
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:15,457
I-- She never scratched me.

614
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:18,335
It's fucking planted.
They don't have a case.

615
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:21,588
They have no case,
so they're fucking trying to frame me.

616
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,006
Dad!

617
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:24,842
Come on! Open it up!
I know you're in there!

618
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:26,802
- Fuck. What?
- <i>There's gotta be a reason for this.</i>

619
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:27,886
- Dad!
- No, I--

620
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:29,930
- What is it? What's going on?
- There's someone at the door!

621
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,015
Raymond, hold on. What's wrong?

622
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:33,851
- I don't know.
- Hey, calm down.

623
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:35,477
- I was just watching TV and--
- Okay.

624
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:36,895
Honey, honey, calm down. It's okay.

625
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:39,356
Hey! Stop banging at my door!

626
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:41,149
- Who is it?
- I don't know!

627
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:42,484
Rusty. Jaden!

628
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:44,570
- You come and fuck with my family!
- Dad, who is that?

629
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,321
- Hold on! Just stop!
- I'm gonna call the cops.

630
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:48,657
No! Do not call the police, Barbara.
Just let me think.

631
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:49,783
Open this door up.

632
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,660
- Jaden, step away from the door!
- Step away!

633
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,203
- Open the fucking door!
- Just ho--

634
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:54,830
- <i>Rusty.</i>
- Mr. Ratzer! Listen to me.

635
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,874
- You come and fuck with my family...
- I'm the one you want.

636
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:59,126
- Step away from my house.
- ...I'll fuck with your family!

637
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:01,420
- Honey, come here. Honey.
- Mr. Ratzer!

638
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,214
- Listen to me...
- <i>Rusty. Hello?</i>

639
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:07,885
One more time! I swear to God!

640
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:10,596
- Rusty!
- Dad!

641
00:41:10,596 --> 00:41:12,014
- Rusty, Stop!
- Enough! Look at me!

642
00:41:12,014 --> 00:41:15,100
- Please! Dad.
- Rusty!
