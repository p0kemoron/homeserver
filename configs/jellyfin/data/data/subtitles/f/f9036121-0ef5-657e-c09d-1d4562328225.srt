1
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,206
I thought we were going to Mick's.

2
00:00:47,366 --> 00:00:50,526
I don't have a lot of time, mate.
I've gotta be at the club at 10:00.

3
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:53,086
Get out of the car, Cleave.

4
00:00:57,966 --> 00:01:01,366
Oh, come on, mate.
Mick knows I'm good for it.

5
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:04,486
Christ, I reckon I've put
both of his boys through Cranbrook.

6
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:06,726
None of us feel good
about this, Cleave,

7
00:01:06,886 --> 00:01:08,526
not Mick, not me.

8
00:01:08,686 --> 00:01:10,006
After what you done
for my brothers...

9
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:12,446
Oh, well, yeah,
now that you mention it, Col.

10
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,486
Mick's got some serious
cash flow issues.

11
00:01:14,646 --> 00:01:16,326
He had to take on
a new business partner.

12
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:17,806
He can't be seen to be weak.

13
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:20,246
I can't be seen to be weak either,
not right now, mate.

14
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:22,566
Oh, come on, Col.

15
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:25,566
Oh!

16
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:29,326
Ohh!

17
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:37,926
Fixed terms of trade now,
Cleave — 14 days.

18
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:51,046
Hey!

19
00:01:54,286 --> 00:01:57,806
Mmm, nice.

20
00:02:01,326 --> 00:02:04,286
You should go to the hospital.

21
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:06,326
You'll do.

22
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:13,286
Oh... Oh, easy, tiger!

23
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:15,686
Oh, fuck.

24
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:20,126
So we get to this bar in Belacena,
I think it was,

25
00:02:20,286 --> 00:02:21,886
and there's this guy...

26
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:23,686
Blindfold guy?
Uh-huh.

27
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:26,006
..and he could play
20 games of chess at once.

28
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,166
What? Some sort of Spanish Rain Man?

29
00:02:28,326 --> 00:02:29,846
I swear!

30
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:32,846
I'd be wanting to see the thread count
on that blindfold, by the way.

31
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:35,406
Arggh!

32
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:37,766
So his girlfriend
told him the moves,

33
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:39,246
he couldn't see a thing,

34
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:43,326
but he remembered every
single square on every board.

35
00:02:43,486 --> 00:02:47,606
He just strolled around the tables,
drinking pernod and playing chess.

36
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:49,446
Who won?
The guy in the blindfold.

37
00:02:49,606 --> 00:02:50,926
Oh, there's a surprise.

38
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:53,246
But my dad gave him
a run for his money.

39
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,126
Ohh!

40
00:02:56,246 --> 00:03:00,566
What? Is she sitting
out there timing us?

41
00:03:01,566 --> 00:03:06,606
This economic climate's turning every
decent vendor in this town into a reptile.

42
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:09,326
First my bookie,
now my brothel keeper.

43
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:11,766
12,000 years I've been
coming to this place.

44
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:15,566
Think I would've accrued some
frequent fucker points by now.

45
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:23,526
Um, I can't do Thursday, by the way.

46
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:28,166
You alright?

47
00:03:28,326 --> 00:03:30,486
Yeah.

48
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,486
Cleaves!

49
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:55,326
Joe!

50
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:57,246
Jesus. What happened to you?

51
00:03:57,406 --> 00:03:59,646
Cupboard door, eye height.

52
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,406
Oh, right. One of Mick's doors?

53
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:04,126
When are you gonna learn?

54
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,766
Oh, next life maybe,
the one after that...

55
00:04:06,926 --> 00:04:09,246
Give it away, mate.
Gambling's a disease.

56
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:11,446
I know. You got a driver?

57
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:14,406
Oh, mate, the days when I could
take a government car to the club

58
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:15,886
are long gone.

59
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:18,166
There is such a thing as
ministerial accountability, you know?

60
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:20,246
Pity.

61
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:22,366
How's the election looking?

62
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:24,166
Well, tighter than
a nun's proverbial,

63
00:04:24,326 --> 00:04:25,646
but we will scrape through.

64
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:28,366
Yeah? The smart money says
you fellas are going down.

65
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:30,966
Is that right?

66
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:33,486
OK, smart money, five grand?

67
00:04:33,646 --> 00:04:35,166
Done.

68
00:05:04,526 --> 00:05:05,846
The gruesome discovery

69
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:09,806
has sent shock waves through
corridors of power the world over.

70
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:11,446
Allie Black reports.

71
00:05:11,606 --> 00:05:14,726
It was to this disused
warehouse in Sydney's inner west...

72
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:16,246
Ooh, hello.

73
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:19,086
..police allege Professor Murray
lured his victim,

74
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:22,086
West Australian solicitor
Sebastian Carey,

75
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:26,006
after first making contact with him
in an internet chat room.

76
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:28,926
How could the Government
possibly have known

77
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:31,006
that Professor Murray
was a cannibal?

78
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,966
He's been a key economic advisor

79
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:34,566
for the past two
federal governments,

80
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:37,126
two Wall Street banks,
three major European...

81
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:40,326
Morning, children!
Ciao, Cleave!

82
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,286
But isn't it the case

83
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:45,686
that the Government based its latest
financial regulatory strategy

84
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,606
on a report written by a psychopath?

85
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:50,606
Might I remind the people
of this great and prosperous State

86
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:54,126
that our adoption
of the recommendations

87
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:56,326
in Professor Murray's report

88
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:59,886
were backed not only by Moody's
and Standard & Poor's,

89
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:02,606
but also by the Opposition.

90
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:05,246
Now, Professor Murray
was engaged as an economist.

91
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,566
What he does in his...

92
00:06:07,726 --> 00:06:10,286
..his spare time is...

93
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:12,606
That's...that's another
matter entirely.

94
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:15,686
I won't be taking any more
questions on this. Thank you.

95
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:17,246
You're fucking kidding me!

96
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:20,926
What do you mean, there's no law
against cannibalism in this State?

97
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:25,486
Well, just that, really.
There's no law against cannibalism.

98
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:28,206
This psychopath has made
a laughing-stock out of us.

99
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:30,766
It's not as if there weren't
a few titters out there already.

100
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:33,406
Get some charges laid,
some serious charges.

101
00:06:33,566 --> 00:06:34,926
Get him on trial, alright?

102
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:39,966
We cannot look soft on this prick.
It's an election year!

103
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:09,326
Colleen, how are we?

104
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,566
Oh. Hey!

105
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,006
Morning.

106
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:27,086
Nicole, Nicolissima.

107
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:29,526
What's the legal position?

108
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:31,646
We're homeless again.
What?

109
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:34,246
Mr Barracliffe's coming back
earlier than anticipated.

110
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:36,406
How much earlier?
Quite a bit earlier, I'm afraid.

111
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:38,686
Mrs Barracliffe's broken her leg.

112
00:07:38,846 --> 00:07:42,046
Well, he's only
been gone two weeks.

113
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:44,406
He told me we could
have the place for four months.

114
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:46,206
What sort of sabbatical
do you call that?

115
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,926
It was day one
on the slopes, apparently —

116
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:51,206
something about her
being piste or off-piste.

117
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,646
Well, they've got surgeons
in France, don't they?

118
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,286
They've got hospitals,

119
00:07:55,446 --> 00:07:58,926
a tres bon health care system,
I'm led to understand.

120
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:00,406
Nevertheless...

121
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:05,366
You want me to start calling around,
find another room?

122
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,446
Yeah.

123
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:10,326
- You have a mention at 10:00.
- Yeah.

124
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:12,686
Yes. Mr Potter.

125
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:15,646
Your Honour, we'd ask that
the subpoena be answered

126
00:08:15,806 --> 00:08:17,686
or the respondent held in contempt.

127
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:19,166
It simply beggars belief

128
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:21,446
that the only files
apparently lost by the respondent

129
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:23,326
are those being sought
by the Taxation Office.

130
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:25,486
Mr Greene.

131
00:08:25,646 --> 00:08:27,686
I couldn't agree more
with my friend, Your Honour.

132
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:31,966
It is indeed
an extraordinary coincidence.

133
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:36,886
But the truth is I am simply
a victim of the weather.

134
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:38,846
Owing to a torrential storm

135
00:08:39,006 --> 00:08:42,566
that was raging over the
eastern suburbs of Sydney that day,

136
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:44,566
the removalists I'd engaged

137
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:50,086
attempted to rush through what
should have been a painstaking task.

138
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:52,766
A number of my boxes
suffered water damage.

139
00:08:52,926 --> 00:08:57,886
Relevant diaries and files relating
to my financial affairs were lost,

140
00:08:58,046 --> 00:09:01,766
as well as cherished personal items.

141
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:07,686
Um, I'm assured that affidavits
from the removalists are forthcoming

142
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:09,966
and so I'd ask Your Honour
for an adjournment.

143
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:11,726
Mr Potter.

144
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:14,606
Our submission respectfully stands,
Your Honour.

145
00:09:14,766 --> 00:09:17,686
The Tax Office has been
more than patient with Mr Greene.

146
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:24,766
We'll hold it over until the...26th.

147
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:26,246
May it please the court.

148
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:28,206
Thank you, Your Honour.

149
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,366
What's up, Harry?

150
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:38,566
Removalists and
rain-damaged boxes...

151
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:41,166
I mean, how long do you really
think you can keep this going?

152
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:43,926
Harry, there's nothing I'd like more
than to have my boxes back.

153
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:46,246
They would exonerate me
in an instant.

154
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:48,806
Bullshit.
Language, please.

155
00:09:48,966 --> 00:09:52,486
My father here has
a very delicate sensibility.

156
00:09:52,646 --> 00:09:56,006
And lay off the ‘Harry' crap.
It's starting to get around.

157
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,366
Are you coming Thursday night?
Yeah, mate, we'll be there.

158
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:00,486
OK, see you then, Barn.

159
00:10:00,646 --> 00:10:02,966
See you, Harry. Oh, sorry, Dave.

160
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:05,566
See you, Harry. Sorry, David.

161
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:07,606
And I'll see you
on the 26th, Cleaver.

162
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:10,046
Sure thing, Harry. Sorry, David.

163
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:14,006
Why are you getting chummy with
the oily tick trying to bankrupt me?

164
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,286
Because I'm with him, mate.
You should pay your taxes.

165
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:18,166
I don't see why I should
support your lifestyle

166
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,646
any more than I do already.

167
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:21,166
Shut up.

168
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:44,486
And in your internet posts,

169
00:10:44,646 --> 00:10:46,766
you were clear
about your intentions?

170
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:49,366
This is the text
of the message, Don.

171
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:53,766
“Is there anyone out there
who would like to be eaten?”

172
00:10:53,926 --> 00:10:57,246
On the second page,
you'll find the deceased's response.

173
00:10:58,246 --> 00:11:00,966
“I want to be eaten.”

174
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:06,326
Right. So you still deny
the murder charge, Professor Murray?

175
00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:10,126
Of course.

176
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:12,926
I'm not a murderer.

177
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:16,686
Tell us about the night in question.

178
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:23,846
He arrived at 8:00.

179
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:30,806
I'd bought a bottle of Krug
so we drank a toast.

180
00:11:31,806 --> 00:11:34,446
While I was busy making
preparations in the kitchen

181
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:38,366
he consumed a large number
of sleeping pills.

182
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,166
A little while after that,
he passed out.

183
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:46,326
And moments later, he was dead.

184
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:49,406
I proceeded to dismember him.

185
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:59,486
Over the course of the next three weeks,
I ate most of his remains.

186
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:04,406
Where was your wife at this time?

187
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:06,366
At home.

188
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:09,446
She knew nothing about it.

189
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:14,806
Have you seen her?
They won't let me talk to her.

190
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,526
I'm worried. I'm worried.
I think she might be a little upset.

191
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:21,006
There is that possibility.
Yes.

192
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,686
Can you get a message to her?

193
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:28,166
What would you like to say?

194
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:31,486
I want you to tell her
not to worry...

195
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:35,406
..that we can get through this.

196
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:39,286
Every marriage
has its ups and downs.

197
00:12:40,286 --> 00:12:42,766
My name is Sebastian Vincent Carey.

198
00:12:42,926 --> 00:12:45,326
My address is
27 Holroyd Place, Perth,

199
00:12:45,486 --> 00:12:47,126
in the State of Western Australia.

200
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:50,966
I am a maritime lawyer employed
by the firm Russell & Garland.

201
00:12:51,126 --> 00:12:53,566
I'm about to commit suicide.

202
00:12:53,726 --> 00:12:57,646
I have here sleeping pills
purchased by myself

203
00:12:57,806 --> 00:13:00,046
which I shall take
in order to induce my death.

204
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:03,406
I repeat — I am committing suicide.

205
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:07,966
I wish for my remains to be consumed
by Professor Murray.

206
00:13:08,126 --> 00:13:09,846
You've always been right, Dad.

207
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:13,926
I am shit. I've always been shit.

208
00:13:17,326 --> 00:13:19,846
And now I will be shit.

209
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,566
Cut fucking snakes,
the pair of them.

210
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:29,046
That may be the case,

211
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:31,806
but the evidence would suggest
our client isn't a murderer, Don.

212
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:33,606
No, he's just a cannibal.

213
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,486
Cannibalism isn't
a crime in this State.

214
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:37,286
Technically all he's done
is mistreat a corpse

215
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:39,006
and failed to notify police
of a death.

216
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,806
That's 2 years max.
He abetted a suicide. That's 10.

217
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:44,806
That's not the charge, Don.
They're going with murder.

218
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:47,126
Yeah, they don't want to look soft
with an election coming.

219
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,606
I reckon there's a window here.
A window?

220
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:52,886
You don't really think, Cleaver, they
could ever possibly let that lunatic out?

221
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:55,606
We'll plead insanity and
he'll be sectioned and off to Bedlam

222
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:57,326
before lunch on the first day,

223
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:59,606
game, set and match.

224
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:02,526
The fact that he's gonna spend
the rest of his days in an asylum

225
00:14:02,686 --> 00:14:05,286
doesn't mean we should cop a murder
plea if he didn't kill anyone.

226
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:06,846
Cleaver, I know reality

227
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:09,206
is a daunting topic
of conversation for you,

228
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:12,126
but our client
ate another human being.

229
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:15,046
He might be as mad as a meataxe —
he probably used a meataxe —

230
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:18,366
but if he didn't kill the deceased
and there's a murder charge,

231
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:19,846
it's gotta be defended.

232
00:14:20,006 --> 00:14:22,766
That's what we do, isn't it?
I'm running late. Gentlemen.

233
00:14:22,926 --> 00:14:25,286
We've got the wife at 3:00.
Cleaver can handle that.

234
00:14:25,446 --> 00:14:27,846
And get some character witnesses,
if you can find any.

235
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:30,846
Justice must be seen to be done,
I suppose.

236
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,326
Well, is that everything for now?

237
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:34,406
Yeah. Thanks, Don.
Thanks, Don.

238
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:36,886
Thank you, Linesman.
Thank you, Ball Boy.

239
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,166
I've always assumed
that I was the linesman.

240
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:46,326
Is it possible, Barnyard, that you're
the Linesman and I'm the Ball Boy?

241
00:14:50,566 --> 00:14:53,126
12 years, we've been married.

242
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:56,326
You think you know someone.

243
00:14:56,486 --> 00:15:00,406
I mean, you...you prepare yourself
for marriage, don't you?

244
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:05,406
Sickness and health and all that,

245
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:07,046
but then...

246
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:15,806
He told me it was chicken...

247
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:18,286
I beg your pardon?

248
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:25,006
The remains that they found
in our freezer at home —

249
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,046
he told me they were
chicken fillets.

250
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:29,566
You didn't actually...

251
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:33,806
With garlic, white wine, pepper
and a little balsamic.

252
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:41,526
Did, uh, you know anything about your
husband's tendencies, Mrs Murray?

253
00:15:41,686 --> 00:15:45,006
Of course not. He's been
a vegetarian since he was 23.

254
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:49,406
What? From vego to cannibal
without so much as a chop in between?

255
00:15:49,566 --> 00:15:52,566
Was your husband
ever prone to violence?

256
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:53,966
No, never.

257
00:15:54,126 --> 00:15:55,566
Did he ever threaten you
with violence?

258
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:58,126
No. He was a very gentle man.

259
00:15:58,286 --> 00:16:00,126
I'm not sure why you're
asking me these questions.

260
00:16:00,286 --> 00:16:02,286
Surely there can't be
any legal issues here.

261
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:05,246
It's important to establish that your
husband wasn't given to violence.

262
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:08,206
“Wasn't given to violence”?

263
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:10,566
He hacked that poor man's
body apart.

264
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:12,646
Yes, but only after he was dead.

265
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,206
We've started
gathering a list of people

266
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:18,006
who might speak
on your husband's behalf.

267
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,646
I'm sorry?
Potential defence witnesses.

268
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:21,886
Defence witnesses?

269
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:25,046
We assume as he's your husband...
You can't.

270
00:16:25,206 --> 00:16:27,006
You can't intrude
on these people's lives

271
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,206
and ask them to speak
on behalf of a cannibal.

272
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:33,126
They have families, reputations!

273
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:36,006
Graham's insane. He's obviously
never going to be released.

274
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,126
Yes, but he's not a murderer.

275
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:40,166
I forbid you to speak
to anyone on that list.

276
00:16:40,326 --> 00:16:41,246
You forbid?

277
00:16:41,406 --> 00:16:43,446
I'm sorry, you're not in a position
to forbid anything.

278
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:46,086
Will you please just...

279
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:48,406
..stop this thing?!

280
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:50,366
It just...

281
00:16:50,526 --> 00:16:52,246
..doesn't serve any purpose.

282
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,806
OK, who's Tyler Banks?

283
00:17:01,806 --> 00:17:03,206
A family friend.

284
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:06,446
Jeremy Brown?
Another friend.

285
00:17:06,606 --> 00:17:08,366
Aden Sinclair?

286
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:11,686
A friend.

287
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:22,206
Oh, fuck.

288
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:40,726
Yes.

289
00:17:46,806 --> 00:17:47,966
Jesus.

290
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:55,990
http://hiqve.com/

291
00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:01,366
Hello.
Eager beaver Cleaver.

292
00:18:01,526 --> 00:18:03,686
Hello.

293
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:11,246
Oh, the belle of Burton Street.
How's tricks?

294
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:12,726
Mmm.

295
00:18:12,886 --> 00:18:15,206
End of the quarter, you know,
always a bloody nightmare —

296
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:16,966
GST, some shit about payroll tax.

297
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:18,726
I don't know why I ever went legit.

298
00:18:18,886 --> 00:18:20,206
Yeah, I wouldn't have.

299
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,646
Missy won't be in tonight, love.

300
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:26,366
She alright?
She quit.

301
00:18:26,526 --> 00:18:27,966
What do you mean, “She quit'?

302
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:29,766
Not coming back.

303
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:32,726
Well, she didn't say anything to me.

304
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:34,566
She wouldn't just quit
without saying something.

305
00:18:34,726 --> 00:18:37,326
Well, she said she wanted
to make a clean break.

306
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:40,886
You know, she was
talking about going to uni.

307
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:57,366
The number you have called

308
00:18:57,526 --> 00:18:58,886
is not connected.

309
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:00,886
Please check the number
before dialling again.

310
00:19:03,046 --> 00:19:05,566
Five years.

311
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:10,846
What?

312
00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:14,526
Well, it's...it's a lot
more common than you think.

313
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,006
What is?

314
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,686
Falling in love with a prostitute.

315
00:19:17,846 --> 00:19:21,006
That's not what this is about.
Really?

316
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,726
What's it about?

317
00:19:22,886 --> 00:19:24,606
It's about...

318
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:29,846
..trust and ethics.

319
00:19:30,006 --> 00:19:31,406
Well, what did you expect?

320
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:34,406
I mean, she was role-playing.
That's what they do.

321
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:36,846
Wendy, she wasn't
role-playing, alright?

322
00:19:37,006 --> 00:19:40,286
Her feelings were genuine.
Believe me.

323
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:44,126
Did you pay her
to visit you in rehab?

324
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:46,966
No, I did not. Well-remembered, Doc.

325
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:49,926
So, you know,
if it's all about business,

326
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:51,726
why was she visiting me in rehab?

327
00:19:51,886 --> 00:19:56,046
Maybe you thought finally you had
a relationship you could control,

328
00:19:56,206 --> 00:19:57,526
dictate all the terms,

329
00:19:57,686 --> 00:20:00,446
but yet again you transgressed
the normal boundaries

330
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:01,926
and allowed feelings...

331
00:20:02,086 --> 00:20:03,446
The normal boundaries
of prostitution?

332
00:20:03,606 --> 00:20:05,286
There are boundaries
to every relationship, Cleave,

333
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:07,566
business, marriage, whatever.

334
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:10,046
Most people are aware of them.

335
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:13,646
Tell me, what do you
miss most about her?

336
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,206
Well, the sex, of course.

337
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:18,926
OK.

338
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:22,646
What can I say?
It was great sex. It was so good.

339
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,446
But that's not what
you miss the most, is it?

340
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:27,526
What are you talking about?
It was every man's dream.

341
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:30,526
It was uncomplicated, it was hot...

342
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:34,566
But what do you miss the most?

343
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:38,326
The backgammon.

344
00:20:39,886 --> 00:20:41,726
Have you tried
to make contact with her?

345
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:45,286
Changed her number, moved house,

346
00:20:45,446 --> 00:20:47,286
disappeared off the face of the earth.

347
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,086
It's like being
in a bloody Polanski movie.

348
00:20:50,246 --> 00:20:52,966
There's this guy I know
who works for a credit agency.

349
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,566
I got him off a couple of
stalking charges a while back.

350
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:58,566
He's looking into her records for me,
but after that...

351
00:20:58,726 --> 00:21:00,606
Mum?
In here, darling.

352
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:03,406
Hello, mate.
Hey, Dad.

353
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:05,646
Scoring another freebie?

354
00:21:06,646 --> 00:21:08,526
Yes.

355
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:14,046
“She walks in beauty
like the night

356
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:18,246
“Of cloudless climes and starry skies

357
00:21:18,406 --> 00:21:21,606
‘And all that's best
of dark and bright

358
00:21:21,766 --> 00:21:25,446
“Meets in her aspect and her eyes

359
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:28,566
“Thus mellowed to that tender light

360
00:21:28,726 --> 00:21:32,846
“Which heaven to gaudy day denies.”

361
00:21:33,006 --> 00:21:34,886
Bugger me, he was good.

362
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:36,686
Yeah, but what use is it?

363
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:40,846
What do you mean, “What use is it"?
It's poetry, you knucklehead.

364
00:21:41,006 --> 00:21:44,206
It has only one use
and that's for pulling chicks.

365
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:47,206
Trust me, mate —
you inhale a bit of Byron now,

366
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:51,046
in a few years time, the dividends
will speak for themselves, boy.

367
00:21:51,206 --> 00:21:54,526
Hey, Dad, can I ask you a favour?
Fire away.

368
00:21:54,686 --> 00:21:56,006
If Mum asks, can you tell her

369
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,726
I stayed at your place
on Friday night?

370
00:21:57,886 --> 00:22:00,446
Oh, yes, and why
would we be lying to Mum?

371
00:22:00,606 --> 00:22:02,966
‘Cause she'll be pissed off
if I tell her the truth.

372
00:22:03,126 --> 00:22:05,686
Which is...?
You don't want to know, Dad.

373
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:07,166
Actually, I do want to know, Fuzz.

374
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,726
No, you don't.
It's no big deal, I swear.

375
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:11,286
It's something you told me you did,

376
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:13,686
like, a thousand times
when you were a kid, so...

377
00:22:13,846 --> 00:22:15,206
Then I really want to know.

378
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:17,566
Look, Dad.

379
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:22,446
What you need
is plausible deniability.

380
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:24,726
If Mum ever found out
what I was really doing,

381
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,446
she'd ask you if you knew.

382
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:28,846
This way, you can
honestly say you don't,

383
00:22:29,006 --> 00:22:31,806
otherwise you're just gonna get
caught up in another web of lies,

384
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:33,726
Mum will drag us
back to family counselling

385
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:36,166
and we both know what
Dr Stirrup will have to say.

386
00:22:36,326 --> 00:22:37,486
What is this?

387
00:22:37,646 --> 00:22:40,166
Dad, I'm trying
to help you out here.

388
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,646
If Mum finds out the truth,

389
00:22:41,806 --> 00:22:44,526
we both know you'll be held
responsible one way or another

390
00:22:44,686 --> 00:22:46,646
because you're
a “terrible role model”.

391
00:22:46,806 --> 00:22:49,646
He said that once
and that was in an early session.

392
00:22:49,806 --> 00:22:53,726
Yeah, but if you back me up,
it will be a non-event.

393
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:56,286
Forget about it, pal.
This is extortion.

394
00:22:56,446 --> 00:23:00,486
I'm not gonna be compromised in
this way by my own flesh and blood.

395
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:03,366
Remember what happened
when she busted me smoking?

396
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:09,326
Last Friday?
Oh, yeah, had a great night.

397
00:23:09,486 --> 00:23:10,886
What did you do?

398
00:23:11,046 --> 00:23:14,446
Oh, just stayed in, had some Thai,

399
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:17,726
he brought around a couple
of hilarious unwatchable DVDs.

400
00:23:17,886 --> 00:23:19,926
Why do you ask?
Mm, no reason.

401
00:23:20,086 --> 00:23:23,046
Oh, listen. I got another love letter
from the school yesterday.

402
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:24,526
Ah, OK.

403
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:26,366
You're 11 grand down
on last year, Cleave.

404
00:23:26,526 --> 00:23:29,966
I can't keep doing it by myself.
No, no, no. Alright.

405
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:33,246
Look, I'm good for it.
My cannibal should cover that.

406
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:35,646
What?

407
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:38,246
How could you possibly
turn that into a money-spinner?

408
00:23:38,406 --> 00:23:39,806
He ate someone.
You'd be surprised.

409
00:23:39,966 --> 00:23:41,286
It's a hopeless case.

410
00:23:41,446 --> 00:23:44,606
They're the only ones
worth fighting for, darling.

411
00:23:46,086 --> 00:23:48,526
Oh, um, wish Barn
a happy birthday for me.

412
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:53,526
Shit. Barney's birthday. Yes, yes.

413
00:23:53,686 --> 00:23:55,806
Good. Good point, good point.

414
00:23:55,966 --> 00:23:57,286
I want an elephant one.

415
00:23:57,446 --> 00:23:59,766
OK!

416
00:23:59,926 --> 00:24:02,526
But you do realise that last week
you wanted giraffes

417
00:24:02,686 --> 00:24:07,406
so I went out and I spent, oh,
a gazillion-billion dollars

418
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:09,286
on giraffe bandaids.

419
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:12,686
Oh, what do you know —
the last elephant in the pack.

420
00:24:12,846 --> 00:24:14,966
Come on, let's see the damage.

421
00:24:16,606 --> 00:24:17,926
She didn't really say that?

422
00:24:18,086 --> 00:24:19,406
I'm afraid she did.

423
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:21,806
And it's official —
we do taste just like chicken.

424
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:26,686
- And what have we got here, Scarlet?
- Oh, Cleaver, please!

425
00:24:26,846 --> 00:24:29,126
- Look, I am enjoying it.
- Hello!

426
00:24:29,286 --> 00:24:32,526
Oh, Joe!

427
00:24:32,686 --> 00:24:35,606
Sorry. Traffic
and everything else.

428
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,806
Cleave, how are you, mate?
Very good. You?

429
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:39,486
Hello, Sal.
Happy birthday, mate.

430
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:40,966
Don't apologise to me.

431
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:42,766
So what body part was it she ate?

432
00:24:42,926 --> 00:24:44,886
Well...
Oh, please.

433
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:47,206
I've been up to my neck
in this psycho all day.

434
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:50,166
But what would be the point, Cleave?
The point of what, Sal?

435
00:24:50,326 --> 00:24:52,406
You said you were pushing
to pursue this to trial.

436
00:24:52,566 --> 00:24:54,126
So what would the point be?

437
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:56,606
Yeah, the time and money
wasted on an exercise

438
00:24:56,766 --> 00:24:59,646
which is gonna make absolutely
no difference to your client's future.

439
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:01,326
Well, to be perfectly
Francis with you,

440
00:25:01,486 --> 00:25:03,366
I don't give a shit
about my client's future.

441
00:25:03,526 --> 00:25:08,326
What I do give a shit about —
believe it or not — is the law.

442
00:25:08,486 --> 00:25:10,246
Since when?!

443
00:25:10,406 --> 00:25:11,726
I don't know about you lot,

444
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:16,126
but I don't want to live in a society
where for purely political reasons,

445
00:25:16,286 --> 00:25:19,006
someone can be charged
with a crime they didn't commit.

446
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,766
You know, that's a pretty
serious accusation, mate.

447
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:22,046
Oh, puh-lease!

448
00:25:22,206 --> 00:25:25,566
And it's all kosher because he's got
a couple of mental health issues.

449
00:25:25,726 --> 00:25:28,006
“Couple of mental health issues”?

450
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:31,246
He ate someone. He's a monster.
He's misunderstood.

451
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:34,286
So you're gonna convince a jury
that this cannibal isn't a monster?

452
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:35,846
Well, it's easier
than convincing them

453
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:37,326
that an economist is a human being.

454
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:40,686
So the taxpayers of this State...

455
00:25:40,846 --> 00:25:43,206
This “great and
prosperous State”, Joe.

456
00:25:43,366 --> 00:25:44,686
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

457
00:25:44,846 --> 00:25:46,286
..have to fork out

458
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:50,886
because one of your
highly selective principles

459
00:25:51,046 --> 00:25:52,486
has reared its ugly head, hey?

460
00:25:52,646 --> 00:25:54,486
You don't give a rat's arse
about the law, Cleave.

461
00:25:54,646 --> 00:25:56,406
You get low-life crooks
off all the time.

462
00:25:56,566 --> 00:25:58,246
51% of the time.

463
00:25:58,406 --> 00:26:00,526
And once again, you misread me.

464
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:04,126
The very reason I get
my low-life crooks off

465
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:07,006
is because I care about the law.

466
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:10,806
It's justice I don't
give a toss about.

467
00:26:13,366 --> 00:26:15,966
You're looking
more battered than usual.

468
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:18,246
No, I'm alright.

469
00:26:20,126 --> 00:26:24,206
Barney told me that your little friend at
the club has flown the coop.

470
00:26:24,366 --> 00:26:25,686
My “little friend”?

471
00:26:25,846 --> 00:26:27,566
Your prostitute.

472
00:26:27,726 --> 00:26:32,126
Oh, my prostitute.
My harlot, Scarlet.

473
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:33,606
Well, don't worry.

474
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:35,766
I'm sure there's plenty more fish
in that particular sea.

475
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:39,046
It's a shame you never met, you know?
You'd like her, Red.

476
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:42,006
You've actually got a lot in common.

477
00:26:43,006 --> 00:26:45,526
Oh, yeah? Do tell.

478
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:48,766
Oh, well, you both
resolutely pretended

479
00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:50,926
you're not madly in love with me.

480
00:26:51,086 --> 00:26:52,526
It's sad, really.

481
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:54,406
Who's madly in love?

482
00:26:54,566 --> 00:26:56,286
Oh, just explaining
to your wife here

483
00:26:56,446 --> 00:26:59,246
that she's secretly in love with
me and she's not alone.

484
00:26:59,406 --> 00:27:01,406
Oh, well, do whatever
you have to, you two.

485
00:27:01,566 --> 00:27:03,286
I'm buggered.
Gotta be up at sparrow's.

486
00:27:03,446 --> 00:27:06,286
I'm gonna call a cab.
Stay. Don't go on my account.

487
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:09,206
‘Night, cock.
Goodnight, cock.

488
00:27:09,366 --> 00:27:11,726
Happy birthday.
Thanks, mate.

489
00:27:11,886 --> 00:27:13,766
Be gentle with him, won't ya?
Yeah.

490
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:16,366
And I haven't forgotten
about that birthday present.

491
00:27:16,526 --> 00:27:18,326
Yes, lots of big ideas.
Yeah.

492
00:27:18,486 --> 00:27:20,126
Yeah.

493
00:27:22,526 --> 00:27:25,406
Now, where were we?

494
00:27:26,406 --> 00:27:31,486
Ah, yes — you banging on about
this threesome with me and my harlot.

495
00:27:31,646 --> 00:27:35,286
Look, Red, it's gonna be tricky.

496
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:37,806
Yeah.

497
00:27:41,246 --> 00:27:42,886
Hey.

498
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,006
Red.

499
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,926
Red. Hey.

500
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:53,446
Red, hey.

501
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:57,246
He is such a good man.

502
00:27:58,686 --> 00:28:01,086
He is such a fucking good man,

503
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,846
but I can't do this anymore.

504
00:28:04,006 --> 00:28:06,126
You can't do what?

505
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:09,526
This marriage.

506
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:11,646
Fuck.

507
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:14,206
You're kidding me.

508
00:28:14,366 --> 00:28:16,806
What do you mean?
Have you spoken to him about it?

509
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:21,206
No, of course not. Of course
I fucking haven't, Cleaver.

510
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:27,006
I'm a woman. I internalise
everything until I explode.

511
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:29,286
Well, listen, listen. Come on.

512
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:32,926
Whatever it is,
you're gonna work it out, alright?

513
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,846
You gotta speak to him about it.

514
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,486
You gotta give him a chance

515
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:41,006
to atone for whatever it is
he needs to atone for.

516
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:47,446
He doesn't have anything
he needs to atone for, alright?

517
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:49,806
That's the trouble.

518
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:53,406
Oh, fuck.

519
00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:06,366
Missy!

520
00:29:10,846 --> 00:29:12,606
Missy! Missy!

521
00:29:12,766 --> 00:29:14,326
So?

522
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,046
So...what the fuck?

523
00:29:17,206 --> 00:29:20,446
You just vanish without
so much as an adios.

524
00:29:20,606 --> 00:29:22,806
I'm going to law school.

525
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:25,126
Law school?

526
00:29:25,286 --> 00:29:26,926
I guess I should be flattered.

527
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:30,566
It's nothing to do with you.
My father was a lawyer.

528
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:32,246
I thought your father was a diplomat.

529
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:34,246
He was a lawyer first.

530
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:37,046
Given what we had...

531
00:29:37,206 --> 00:29:39,366
We had a business relationship.

532
00:29:39,526 --> 00:29:41,246
That's not how I would
choose to categorise it.

533
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:42,966
The use of a credit card

534
00:29:43,126 --> 00:29:45,686
is usually evidence of
a commercial transaction, is it not?

535
00:29:45,846 --> 00:29:47,526
What about the times
you came to my place?

536
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:48,526
You still paid.

537
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,726
Alright, what about when
you visited me in rehab?

538
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:52,206
Jesus, Cleave, what's your point?

539
00:29:52,366 --> 00:29:55,006
My point is it wasn't just
a business relationship

540
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:56,486
and you know that's my point

541
00:29:56,646 --> 00:29:58,886
so stop being whatever it is
that you're being.

542
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:01,086
I'm being me.
You're not.

543
00:30:01,246 --> 00:30:03,446
I know you.
No, you don't.

544
00:30:03,606 --> 00:30:06,246
I was who you wanted me to be.

545
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:08,246
Some guys want me to be the nurse,

546
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:12,206
some guys want me to be a
schoolgirl, a dominatrix, whatever.

547
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:14,366
You wanted me to be your friend.

548
00:30:14,526 --> 00:30:17,766
And so I was. That was the gig.
That is horse shit.

549
00:30:17,926 --> 00:30:19,486
You can choose to believe
whatever you like.

550
00:30:19,646 --> 00:30:22,366
I'm not choosing to believe anything.
It's an objective fact.

551
00:30:22,526 --> 00:30:26,286
What is?
You and me. Us. This.

552
00:30:26,446 --> 00:30:29,486
Our connection is real and palpable

553
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:32,646
and you can't just write it off
as a part of some exit strategy.

554
00:30:32,806 --> 00:30:35,566
I'm happy when I'm with you.

555
00:30:35,726 --> 00:30:38,566
I guess that's why
I got the big bucks.

556
00:30:41,686 --> 00:30:45,446
If we happen to bump into
each other in the future

557
00:30:45,606 --> 00:30:48,646
I trust I can rely
on your discretion?

558
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:51,966
My discretion?

559
00:30:53,526 --> 00:30:55,406
Of course.
Thank you.

560
00:30:55,566 --> 00:30:57,446
Adios.

561
00:31:02,966 --> 00:31:04,686
Hey.

562
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:06,766
What about our things?

563
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:12,886
What about Ravel?
Go away. Please.

564
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:16,246
Henry Miller? The Marquis de Sade?

565
00:31:16,406 --> 00:31:20,846
Jackie Gleason?
Non-conceptual art, huh?

566
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:22,686
I gave all these things to you.

567
00:31:22,846 --> 00:31:25,886
So what do I owe you?
You owe me an explanation.

568
00:31:26,046 --> 00:31:29,126
I owe you nothing.
You got what you paid for.

569
00:31:29,286 --> 00:31:31,446
I've drawn a line in the sand.

570
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:35,446
You are part of my past now.

571
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:55,566
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Cleaver Greene, counsel,

572
00:31:55,726 --> 00:31:57,406
and I've been asked to step in today

573
00:31:57,566 --> 00:32:01,246
for your usual lecturer
who's temporarily indisposed.

574
00:32:01,406 --> 00:32:04,486
Now, who can tell me
where you're all up to?

575
00:32:04,646 --> 00:32:06,606
That girl there.

576
00:32:06,766 --> 00:32:11,406
Yeah, blondie? You? No?

577
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:12,926
Yeah?

578
00:32:13,086 --> 00:32:14,846
We've been discussing
the Trade Practices Act.

579
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:20,686
Ah, misleading and deceptive conduct.
I know it only too well.

580
00:32:21,886 --> 00:32:26,486
Section 51.1 was designed
to protect the unsuspecting

581
00:32:26,646 --> 00:32:28,126
from the unscrupulous.

582
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:32,486
If, in the course of
a professional transaction,

583
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:35,926
the party whose services
you've engaged

584
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:37,486
makes certain warranties,

585
00:32:37,646 --> 00:32:39,366
are you not, as the purchaser,

586
00:32:39,526 --> 00:32:42,966
entitled to rely
upon those warranties?

587
00:32:44,206 --> 00:32:45,926
OK, let's look at this
from a whole other angle.

588
00:32:46,086 --> 00:32:49,846
How many here today
are fans of Ravel, huh?

589
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:53,686
Oh, don't you just love him?

590
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:57,766
What about ‘Piano Concerto in D'? No?

591
00:32:57,926 --> 00:32:59,806
What about
the ‘Easy Listening Classics'?

592
00:32:59,966 --> 00:33:02,366
Everybody loves a boléro. Come on.

593
00:33:02,526 --> 00:33:05,526
(HUMS RAVEL'S ‘BOLERO'

594
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:13,006
Rrrum! Pa-da-da dum!
Rrrum! Pa-da-da dum...

595
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:15,326
Greene.

596
00:33:15,486 --> 00:33:18,286
Professor Morrison!
Glad you've made a speedy recovery.

597
00:33:18,446 --> 00:33:20,086
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've been a terrific crowd.

598
00:33:20,246 --> 00:33:21,726
Thank you, Corporate Law 1.

599
00:33:23,006 --> 00:33:25,046
Professor Sinclair, this is Nicole.

600
00:33:25,206 --> 00:33:27,566
How do you do?
My back is killing me. Thank you.

601
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:29,926
We're between digs.

602
00:33:30,086 --> 00:33:32,126
So you were close
to Professor Murray?

603
00:33:32,286 --> 00:33:36,246
Very. Both Friedmanites
down to our bootstraps.

604
00:33:36,406 --> 00:33:40,086
Both pro-market,
both anti-big government.

605
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:42,646
We co-authored countless papers,

606
00:33:42,806 --> 00:33:45,526
we sat on a number of
advisory committees together.

607
00:33:45,686 --> 00:33:49,446
In the late '90s, we were
both seconded to Treasury.

608
00:33:49,606 --> 00:33:52,926
Costello dubbed us
the “Twin Apostles'.

609
00:33:53,086 --> 00:33:55,326
Did Professor Murray
give you any clue

610
00:33:55,486 --> 00:33:57,646
that he may have been a cannibal?

611
00:33:57,806 --> 00:33:59,126
Of course not.

612
00:33:59,286 --> 00:34:02,246
So until the moment you heard
he'd eaten Sebastian Carey,

613
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:04,926
you thought he was perfectly normal?

614
00:34:05,926 --> 00:34:07,726
No.

615
00:34:07,886 --> 00:34:10,926
But nothing's been normal
since the crisis began.

616
00:34:11,086 --> 00:34:14,726
You don't mean
the global financial crisis?

617
00:34:20,646 --> 00:34:22,806
I am married

618
00:34:22,966 --> 00:34:27,246
and my wife is an invalid
and very dependent on me.

619
00:34:31,206 --> 00:34:35,846
But minutes before the Lehman
Brothers collapse was announced,

620
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:37,846
Professor Murray's wife and I

621
00:34:38,006 --> 00:34:43,526
finally consummated
what had been a long-standing

622
00:34:43,686 --> 00:34:47,606
but up until then
purely emotional affair.

623
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:52,406
That very same day, Mr Greene,
almost down to the second...

624
00:34:53,646 --> 00:34:56,886
..I slept with my best friend's wife

625
00:34:57,046 --> 00:35:00,166
and betrayed my own

626
00:35:00,326 --> 00:35:05,046
and almost instantly the world
as I knew it ceased to exist.

627
00:35:13,126 --> 00:35:14,446
Yes!

628
00:35:14,606 --> 00:35:16,926
Game, set and match.

629
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:20,566
Thank you, Linesman.
Thank you, Ball Boy.

630
00:35:20,726 --> 00:35:22,726
Ohh!

631
00:35:25,246 --> 00:35:25,406
It was...the late
Mr Osbourne's opinion

632
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:29,126
It was...the late
Mr Osbourne's opinion

633
00:35:29,286 --> 00:35:31,326
that you should
plead guilty of murder,

634
00:35:31,486 --> 00:35:33,726
but by reason of insanity.

635
00:35:34,726 --> 00:35:36,646
But I killed no-one.

636
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:38,366
That's right.

637
00:35:38,526 --> 00:35:40,326
So why am I still in here?

638
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:44,686
You've been charged with murder
so there has to be a trial.

639
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:46,566
Where they will find me innocent.

640
00:35:46,726 --> 00:35:48,046
Perhaps.

641
00:35:48,206 --> 00:35:49,966
Then I can go home to Annie.

642
00:35:50,126 --> 00:35:54,926
Graham...you ate someone.
You're never going home.

643
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,446
He was already dead!

644
00:35:57,606 --> 00:36:03,446
I mean, what could be more natural
than wanting to consume human flesh?

645
00:36:03,606 --> 00:36:08,806
It combines our two most primal
instincts into one single act.

646
00:36:09,966 --> 00:36:11,566
Remember your first kiss, Mr Greene?

647
00:36:11,726 --> 00:36:15,966
Your tongue snaking down
into someone else's soul?

648
00:36:16,126 --> 00:36:21,246
We caress necks, we kiss them,
we give each other love bites.

649
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,446
You know, these bloody
gorgeous purple bruises

650
00:36:24,606 --> 00:36:29,606
that we wear as badges of honour.

651
00:36:31,086 --> 00:36:34,406
But you break the skin,
you go that one tiny step further,

652
00:36:34,566 --> 00:36:36,366
and we're considered vampires,

653
00:36:36,526 --> 00:36:40,646
monsters that should be
consigned into eternal darkness.

654
00:36:41,686 --> 00:36:44,606
It's the worst sort of hypocrisy.

655
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:47,766
Did you call Roy?
Yeah, he'll be here.

656
00:36:47,926 --> 00:36:50,646
I was thinking maybe you shouldn't
refer to Graham as Professor Murray.

657
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:52,926
It makes him sound a bit smart.
Good point.

658
00:36:54,726 --> 00:36:57,846
We shall prove
beyond reasonable doubt

659
00:36:58,006 --> 00:37:02,446
that the defendant preyed on the
frailties of a mentally ill person

660
00:37:02,606 --> 00:37:07,206
in an effort to induce his death

661
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:10,726
and then eat him.

662
00:37:10,886 --> 00:37:14,726
The defendant —
Professor Graham Murray, AM —

663
00:37:14,886 --> 00:37:16,206
is a brilliant economist.

664
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:17,886
These are not my words.

665
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:19,366
These are words
that have been applied

666
00:37:19,526 --> 00:37:21,006
to Professor Murray many times,

667
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:24,046
as recently as 12 months ago
by Ben Bernanke,

668
00:37:24,206 --> 00:37:27,086
chairman of the US Federal Reserve.

669
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:32,686
He was for a time head of
economic policy for the OECD.

670
00:37:32,846 --> 00:37:37,286
The multibillionaire Warren Buffett

671
00:37:37,446 --> 00:37:38,886
once spoke at a dinner

672
00:37:39,046 --> 00:37:41,006
in honour of Professor Murray.

673
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:45,766
He said, “There is nothing
Graham Murray can't do

674
00:37:45,926 --> 00:37:48,846
“if he puts his mind to it.

675
00:37:49,006 --> 00:37:52,566
“The man is a genius.”

676
00:37:52,726 --> 00:37:55,166
Roy. Roy!

677
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,566
Anything useful yet?
They look like they hate him.

678
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:04,086
They're not saying
that they hate him.

679
00:38:04,246 --> 00:38:06,126
They're saying they're
scared shitless of him.

680
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:08,966
Mr Greene?

681
00:38:09,126 --> 00:38:11,086
Thank you, Your Honour.

682
00:38:11,246 --> 00:38:15,806
Ladies and gentlemen, the only charge
being defended in this trial

683
00:38:15,966 --> 00:38:18,406
is that of murder.

684
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:23,886
There is in fact no law
against cannibalism in this State.

685
00:38:26,046 --> 00:38:31,326
But I'm betting — and, tragically,
I'm nothing if not a betting man —

686
00:38:31,486 --> 00:38:35,726
that if you had to decide right now,

687
00:38:35,886 --> 00:38:39,006
you would find the accused
guilty of murder

688
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:44,326
because the very idea of being
in the same room as a cannibal

689
00:38:44,486 --> 00:38:46,806
scares the hell out of you.

690
00:38:46,966 --> 00:38:51,606
We don't deny the accused
is a cannibal.

691
00:38:51,766 --> 00:38:53,806
We don't defend that fact.

692
00:38:53,966 --> 00:38:56,326
But that is not the charge.

693
00:38:56,486 --> 00:38:58,686
The charge is murder

694
00:38:58,846 --> 00:39:00,686
and we will prove,

695
00:39:00,846 --> 00:39:04,486
using the deceased's
very own last words,

696
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:07,846
that Graham Murray is innocent.

697
00:39:08,006 --> 00:39:10,246
The charge is murder

698
00:39:10,406 --> 00:39:16,206
and you must remember it is
a universally accepted legal doctrine

699
00:39:16,366 --> 00:39:20,606
that you cannot murder a dead man.

700
00:39:20,766 --> 00:39:24,326
Dr Hartcher, have you
read the police report

701
00:39:24,486 --> 00:39:26,326
into the death of Sebastian Carey?

702
00:39:26,486 --> 00:39:27,926
I have.

703
00:39:28,086 --> 00:39:30,566
Were you able to draw
any inferences from this report

704
00:39:30,726 --> 00:39:33,286
in terms of the victim's
state of mind?

705
00:39:33,446 --> 00:39:36,486
Objection.
Pardon me, Your Honour.

706
00:39:36,646 --> 00:39:38,926
The deceased's state of mind?

707
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:41,126
I have.

708
00:39:41,286 --> 00:39:43,246
Whilst most of us
make the transition

709
00:39:43,406 --> 00:39:46,566
from adolescent to adult
with varying degrees of success,

710
00:39:46,726 --> 00:39:49,366
there are some amongst us

711
00:39:49,526 --> 00:39:52,086
whose egos are so badly
traumatised by the process

712
00:39:52,246 --> 00:39:54,246
that they lose any sense of self.

713
00:39:54,406 --> 00:39:56,366
In a very small number of cases,

714
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:59,766
this abnegation of the self
becomes so extreme

715
00:39:59,926 --> 00:40:04,606
that it develops into a fetish of sorts
of self-degradation.

716
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:07,646
This could manifest as a desire

717
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:11,486
to turn oneself into
another's excrement.

718
00:40:11,646 --> 00:40:17,166
Dr Hartcher, do you believe
that such a mind

719
00:40:17,326 --> 00:40:20,526
may be vulnerable
to powers of suggestion,

720
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:22,206
psychological manipulation?

721
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:23,646
Yes.

722
00:40:26,126 --> 00:40:29,046
Dr Hartcher, have you ever
eaten another animal's flesh?

723
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:32,086
Yes.

724
00:40:32,246 --> 00:40:34,366
Having cooked that flesh yourself?

725
00:40:34,526 --> 00:40:36,006
Yes.

726
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:38,646
- Seasoned it?
- Your Honour.

727
00:40:38,806 --> 00:40:40,206
I'm happy to move on, Your Honour.

728
00:40:40,366 --> 00:40:44,766
I have here a raft
of sworn statements

729
00:40:44,926 --> 00:40:47,046
by colleagues of the deceased —

730
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:48,806
senior West Australian lawyers,

731
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:52,006
which mustn't be held
against them, Your Honour.

732
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:54,406
Have you had an opportunity to
read these statements, Dr Hartcher?

733
00:40:54,566 --> 00:40:55,886
I have.

734
00:40:56,046 --> 00:40:59,526
He worked on average
15.4 hours a day,

735
00:40:59,686 --> 00:41:02,606
usually six days a week.

736
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:07,006
None of these statements
even hints at self-abnegation.

737
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:11,006
The common threads are
“Quiet, kept to himself,

738
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:15,246
“professional, dependable, dull...”

739
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,366
This is not inconsistent
with our research, Mr Greene.

740
00:41:18,526 --> 00:41:19,846
Oh?

741
00:41:20,006 --> 00:41:21,846
As I have repeatedly stated,

742
00:41:22,006 --> 00:41:26,046
people such as the deceased can
be fully functional, professionally.

743
00:41:26,206 --> 00:41:30,806
Now, Dr Hartcher, I need you
to be absolutely clear about this.

744
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:34,766
Are you saying that
it is entirely possible

745
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:39,246
that the deceased presented himself
to his West Australian colleagues

746
00:41:39,406 --> 00:41:41,886
as rational and functioning?

747
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:43,366
Yes.

748
00:41:43,526 --> 00:41:46,006
They would have had
no idea or suspicion

749
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:48,046
as to his mental capacity?

750
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:51,126
If they did, I presume
he couldn't function as a lawyer.

751
00:41:51,286 --> 00:41:53,206
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that.

752
00:41:54,526 --> 00:41:56,126
It follows therefore

753
00:41:56,286 --> 00:42:00,166
that the deceased could have
presented himself to my client

754
00:42:00,326 --> 00:42:02,046
as rational and functioning

755
00:42:02,206 --> 00:42:04,086
on the night they met in a warehouse.

756
00:42:04,246 --> 00:42:08,606
Uh, but for the fact the deceased
was going there to be eaten.

757
00:42:08,766 --> 00:42:11,926
I should have thought that
would present a bit of a clue.

758
00:42:14,726 --> 00:42:17,046
She ran right over you!
I made my points.

759
00:42:17,206 --> 00:42:18,846
She RAN right OVER you!

760
00:42:19,006 --> 00:42:23,006
Dr Hartcher was much more
impressive than anticipated.

761
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:29,446
Where's Annie? Why isn't she here?

762
00:42:30,446 --> 00:42:32,486
Huh? Where's Aden?
Dunno, Graham.

763
00:42:33,766 --> 00:42:36,126
I need her here.

764
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:37,766
Where is she?!

765
00:42:44,126 --> 00:42:46,606
Oh, Jesus, you blokes,
give her a break!

766
00:42:46,766 --> 00:42:48,206
Come on, Teddy.
You're better than this.

767
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:49,686
A man's gotta eat, Cleave.

768
00:42:49,846 --> 00:42:51,766
Always after your
pound of flesh, aren't you?

769
00:42:51,926 --> 00:42:53,526
Nothing but a bunch
of bottom feeders.

770
00:42:53,686 --> 00:42:56,166
You ought to know.
Bite me!

771
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:02,126
Those hacks,
they follow me everywhere.

772
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:06,846
That'll be them now.

773
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:10,446
It's never going to end.

774
00:43:11,686 --> 00:43:16,766
What I want to know
is who told them that I ate too?

775
00:43:16,926 --> 00:43:18,446
It wasn't us.

776
00:43:18,606 --> 00:43:20,686
That would've been
a cop on a retainer.

777
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:25,606
Mrs Murray, have you seen
Professor Sinclair recently?

778
00:43:26,806 --> 00:43:28,126
Yes, I have.

779
00:43:28,286 --> 00:43:30,086
Did he happen to mention to you

780
00:43:30,246 --> 00:43:33,126
that he...he told us
about you and he...

781
00:43:33,286 --> 00:43:34,846
Yes.

782
00:43:36,686 --> 00:43:38,646
Yes, he did.

783
00:43:39,646 --> 00:43:42,846
I don't know what
possessed him to tell you.

784
00:43:43,006 --> 00:43:45,246
It's no-one else's business.

785
00:43:45,406 --> 00:43:48,166
I think he feels a little guilty.

786
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:52,646
We did it once,

787
00:43:52,806 --> 00:43:54,966
ONE time,

788
00:43:55,126 --> 00:43:58,646
and it just happened to be
the morning that Lehman's collapsed

789
00:43:58,806 --> 00:44:00,646
so Aden's got it
in his head somewhere...

790
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:03,646
He thinks that
the whole financial crisis

791
00:44:03,806 --> 00:44:06,126
is some sort of moral retribution.

792
00:44:06,286 --> 00:44:09,286
Sometimes I wonder who's madder —
him or Graham.

793
00:44:11,846 --> 00:44:15,006
It's only a matter of time
before he feels the need to...

794
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:18,046
..confess to someone else.

795
00:44:18,206 --> 00:44:19,686
His wife maybe.

796
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:23,286
The faculty.

797
00:44:24,606 --> 00:44:29,686
Oh, God. What if he tells the press?
It'll never end.

798
00:44:29,846 --> 00:44:32,006
He's not gonna do that, Mrs Murray.

799
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:39,886
Mrs Murray, your husband
needs you in court.

800
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:46,926
I told you. I'm...
I'm not going to testify.

801
00:44:47,086 --> 00:44:50,686
We're not asking you to testify.

802
00:44:52,286 --> 00:44:54,086
Did you talk to Barn?
Yes.

803
00:44:54,246 --> 00:44:56,566
When you take that sip of water...

804
00:44:56,726 --> 00:44:58,086
Anything else?

805
00:44:58,246 --> 00:45:00,486
You've got most of the jury onside.

806
00:45:00,646 --> 00:45:02,886
They think that Sebastian
topped himself.

807
00:45:03,046 --> 00:45:05,966
But one or two of the old ducks,

808
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:08,766
they still think that
he's too clever by half.

809
00:45:08,926 --> 00:45:11,446
Right. Great. Thanks, mate.

810
00:45:11,606 --> 00:45:14,806
Had you met Mr Carey
before that night at the warehouse?

811
00:45:14,966 --> 00:45:17,366
No, regrettably.

812
00:45:17,526 --> 00:45:19,486
Did you have a conversation with him?

813
00:45:19,646 --> 00:45:21,726
Yes, we had a nice chat.

814
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:26,526
He was a lovely fellow. Very sad,
but he was a lovely fellow.

815
00:45:26,686 --> 00:45:29,926
Did you discuss the GFC?

816
00:45:31,526 --> 00:45:34,246
I beg your pardon?
The global financial crisis.

817
00:45:34,406 --> 00:45:36,126
Did you talk about that?

818
00:45:36,286 --> 00:45:39,006
Um...no, no.

819
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:42,766
Is it a topic of conversation
you'd prefer to avoid?

820
00:45:42,926 --> 00:45:45,366
Oh, no, not especially.

821
00:45:45,526 --> 00:45:50,966
You failed to predict it,
didn't you, Mr Murray?

822
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:52,446
Yes. Everyone did.

823
00:45:52,606 --> 00:45:54,126
Oh, well, not everyone.

824
00:45:54,286 --> 00:45:57,166
There were a handful in
the United States who predicted it.

825
00:45:57,326 --> 00:45:58,646
There were a couple in Europe.

826
00:45:58,806 --> 00:46:01,686
Keynesians. Their modelling
was deeply flawed.

827
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:05,406
So they just got lucky, did they?

828
00:46:05,566 --> 00:46:08,446
The truth is, Mr Murray,

829
00:46:08,606 --> 00:46:11,166
you're just not that clever, are you?

830
00:46:12,286 --> 00:46:13,766
I beg your pardon?

831
00:46:16,646 --> 00:46:20,046
How could you possibly be a genius

832
00:46:20,206 --> 00:46:25,446
when you failed to predict the single
biggest economic event of our times?

833
00:46:26,446 --> 00:46:30,126
You missed it by a mile, didn't you,

834
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:32,606
you and your free market pals?

835
00:46:32,766 --> 00:46:35,086
You thought you'd
factored in everything —

836
00:46:35,246 --> 00:46:36,566
it was a perfect market —

837
00:46:36,726 --> 00:46:40,966
except there was one thing that
you failed to take into account.

838
00:46:41,126 --> 00:46:44,766
The bottomless pit of human greed.

839
00:46:45,766 --> 00:46:47,806
And that's something
that's impossible to quantify,

840
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:49,966
isn't it, Mr Murray?

841
00:46:50,126 --> 00:46:54,206
Well, it...it's...

842
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:56,486
..it finds a level.

843
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:58,926
But it didn't, did it?

844
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:02,886
Mr Greene, this is
a most unusual re-examination.

845
00:47:03,046 --> 00:47:06,126
Your Honour, my friend
spent a lot of time

846
00:47:06,286 --> 00:47:08,926
asking Mr Murray about his expertise.

847
00:47:09,086 --> 00:47:10,446
Very well.

848
00:47:10,606 --> 00:47:14,406
Mr Murray, did your wife Annie

849
00:47:14,566 --> 00:47:18,406
know anything about your assignation
with Sebastian Carey?

850
00:47:18,566 --> 00:47:21,126
No, nothing. I told you.

851
00:47:21,286 --> 00:47:24,286
I swear. She...
she means the world to me.

852
00:47:24,446 --> 00:47:27,046
I'd never do anything to hurt her.

853
00:47:27,206 --> 00:47:30,286
I'm so sorry, my love.
I'm...I'm so sorry.

854
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:34,046
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

855
00:47:34,206 --> 00:47:36,246
I'm not a killer!

856
00:47:37,886 --> 00:47:41,566
I'm an economist! Annie!

857
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:44,286
This is the prosecution's
criminal mastermind.

858
00:47:46,206 --> 00:47:48,446
This is their cold-blooded genius.

859
00:47:48,606 --> 00:47:50,086
Mr Greene.

860
00:47:53,086 --> 00:47:55,046
You've come to a verdict
in the charge of murder?

861
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,526
We have, Your Honour.

862
00:47:56,686 --> 00:47:58,086
And what verdict have you come to?

863
00:47:58,246 --> 00:47:59,686
We find the defendant not guilty.

864
00:47:59,846 --> 00:48:03,526
Thank you. You are dismissed.

865
00:48:03,686 --> 00:48:05,126
Now, pending further
psychiatric evaluation...

866
00:48:05,286 --> 00:48:07,926
YES! I knew it!

867
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:10,446
..Mr Murray will continue
to be held in medical remand.

868
00:48:10,606 --> 00:48:13,366
I knew it, I knew it!
Darling, I'm innocent.

869
00:48:13,526 --> 00:48:15,326
Yes!

870
00:48:32,286 --> 00:48:35,846
Hey.
Hey.

871
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:38,886
Are you good?

872
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:43,206
Yes, I am great. You?

873
00:48:43,366 --> 00:48:45,126
I hear...

874
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:48,246
..you won your cannibal case.

875
00:48:48,406 --> 00:48:50,566
In a manner of speaking, yeah.

876
00:48:50,726 --> 00:48:53,806
Oh! Do you ever shop?

877
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:56,926
What?

878
00:48:57,086 --> 00:48:58,406
What do you mean, “What”?

879
00:48:58,566 --> 00:49:02,006
I mean what? Why the monk face?

880
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:05,286
Well, I thought, um...

881
00:49:05,446 --> 00:49:11,006
..lines had been drawn and, uh,
the sands of time parted.

882
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:17,486
You were right.

883
00:49:17,646 --> 00:49:20,326
I do owe you an explanation.

884
00:49:24,486 --> 00:49:27,406
I had a charmed life
as a little girl, Cleave.

885
00:49:27,566 --> 00:49:33,086
My dad took me to all
of these fabulous places

886
00:49:33,246 --> 00:49:34,846
where we met fabulous people.

887
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:37,366
Yes, it was a fairytale. I know.

888
00:49:37,526 --> 00:49:38,926
Just before I turned 18,

889
00:49:39,086 --> 00:49:41,886
my parents were killed
in a car crash

890
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:43,726
and I fell apart.

891
00:49:43,886 --> 00:49:48,006
Everything turned to shit,
deep, serious shit.

892
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:50,166
You can guess the rest.

893
00:49:51,566 --> 00:49:54,686
Now I have a chance to start again.

894
00:49:55,846 --> 00:49:57,926
I want to start again.

895
00:49:58,926 --> 00:50:00,406
Do you understand?

896
00:50:05,446 --> 00:50:07,246
So...

897
00:50:08,246 --> 00:50:13,126
..I was wondering if you
could explain this to me.

898
00:50:13,286 --> 00:50:15,486
It's all Greek to me.

899
00:50:16,486 --> 00:50:19,126
Latin, actually.

900
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:24,406
My name's Melissa Partridge,
by the way.

901
00:50:24,566 --> 00:50:27,166
Cleaver Greene.

902
00:50:27,326 --> 00:50:29,606
How do you do?
